"SEATTLE - Dec. 5, 2016 - Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center announced promising results from an early trial in which patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia received genetically engineered immune cells. Of the 12 AML patients who received this experimental T-cell therapy after a transplant put their disease in remission, all are still in remission after a median follow-up of more than two years.

Giving these cells when disease is in remission after transplant ""might actually be helping patients who have a high risk of relapsing to not relapse down the line,"" said Dr. Aude Chapuis, cancer physician and immunotherapy researcher at Fred Hutch, one of the study's leaders. Chapuis presented these results at the 2016 annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology in San Diego, California.

The findings in this group of trial participants contrast with the outcomes the researchers observed in a cohort of similar patients who received transplants around the same time but did not receive engineered T cells. In all of these transplant-only patients, the transplants produced remissions, but more than a quarter of them relapsed within just 10 months.

In the experimental T-cell therapy tested in this trial, certain T cells from each patient's transplant donor were genetically engineered to produce receptors that allowed the T cells to recognize, very specifically, a target molecule called WT1. WT1 is 10 to 1,000 times more common in leukemia cells than their noncancerous cousins, making it a natural target for therapies designed to destroy cancer cells while leaving most healthy cells alone.

This is the team's first trial of this strategy, which was initially developed in the lab of Dr. Phil Greenberg, one of the study's leaders and the head of Fred Hutch's Program in Immunology. Because it was the first study of this particular approach, the researchers focused on a high-risk group -- AML patients undergoing bone marrow transplant who had certain genetic or disease characteristics that decrease the chance of long-term transplant success -- ""a hard population of patients,"" Chapuis said, many of whom ""were horribly sick.""

Each patient's therapy was created just for them in a specialized Fred Hutch facility. Certain T cells from each patient's matched donor were given the genetic instructions to make a receptor that specifically reacts to WT1. Then came a blood stem cell transplant: Patients' leukemic bone marrow and blood cells were destroyed and replaced with healthy cells from their donors. A month later, when the team examined these 12 patients' marrow, they found no trace of the cancers. Rapidly thereafter, once the transplanted cells fully engrafted, each patient then received up to 10 billion of the genetically engineered donor cells, infused into their arm through an IV.

Chapuis's role in this trial is on the laboratory side of the research, ensuring the quality of the genetically engineered cell products and monitoring the activity of the cells after infusion. She co-leads this research with Greenberg and Dr. Dan Egan of Fred Hutch, the trial's principal investigator and the care provider for trial participants. The study was supported by funding from the National Institutes of Health and spinoff Juno Therapeutics, of which Greenberg is a scientific co-founder.

Outside of this trial, Chapuis treats cancer patients at Fred Hutch's clinical care partner, Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. Watching her patients undergo bone marrow transplant ? itself the first clear and reproducible example of cancer immunotherapy, developed at Fred Hutch ? has made her want to work toward something better.

""That's my source of inspiration. I'm always horrified by the intense treatment that we inflict on bone marrow transplant patients and the hardship that we make them go through. And I really think we can do better,"" Chapuis said. ""That's why I'm doing this.""

At Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, home to three Nobel laureates, interdisciplinary teams of world-renowned scientists seek new and innovative ways to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer, HIV/AIDS and other life-threatening diseases. Fred Hutch's pioneering work in bone marrow transplantation led to the development of immunotherapy, which harnesses the power of the immune system to treat cancer with minimal side effects. An independent, nonprofit research institute based in Seattle, Fred Hutch houses the nation's first and largest cancer prevention research program, as well as the clinical coordinating center of the Women's Health Initiative and the international headquarters of the HIV Vaccine Trials Network. Private contributions are essential for enabling Fred Hutch scientists to explore novel research opportunities that lead to important medical breakthroughs.

Immunotherapy shows promise in preventing leukemia relapse	2016-12-29 06:00:00	https://web.archive.org/web/20161207131158/https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-12/fhcr-isp120316.php	news_reviews_00318	fake
"A new Norwegian diet intervention study (FATFUNC), performed by researchers at the KG Jebsen center for diabetes research at the University of Bergen, raises questions regarding the validity of a diet hypothesis that has dominated for more than half a century: that dietary fat and particularly saturated fat is unhealthy for most people.

The researchers found strikingly similar health effects of diets based on either lowly processed carbohydrates or fats. In the randomized controlled trial, 38 men with abdominal obesity followed a dietary pattern high in either carbohydrates or fat, of which about half was saturated. Fat mass in the abdominal region, liver and heart was measured with accurate analyses, along with a number of key risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

""The very high intake of total and saturated fat did not increase the calculated risk of cardiovascular diseases,"" says professor and cardiologist Ottar Nygård who contributed to the study.

""Participants on the very-high-fat diet also had substantial improvements in several important cardiometabolic risk factors, such as ectopic fat storage, blood pressure, blood lipids (triglycerides), insulin and blood sugar.""

High quality food is healthier

Both groups had similar intakes of energy, proteins, polyunsaturated fatty acids, the food types were the same and varied mainly in quantity, and intake of added sugar was minimized.

""We here looked at effects of total and saturated fat in the context of a healthy diet rich in fresh, lowly processed and nutritious foods, including high amounts of vegetables and rice instead of flour-based products,"" says PhD candidate Vivian Veum.

""The fat sources were also lowly processed, mainly butter, cream and cold-pressed oils.""

Total energy intake was within the normal range. Even the participants who increased their energy intake during the study showed substantial reductions in fat stores and disease risk.

""Our findings indicate that the overriding principle of a healthy diet is not the quantity of fat or carbohydrates, but the quality of the foods we eat,"" says PhD candidate Johnny Laupsa-Borge.

Saturated fat increases the ""good"" cholesterol

Saturated fat has been thought to promote cardiovascular diseases by raising the ""bad"" LDL cholesterol in the blood. But even with a higher fat intake in the FATFUNC study compared to most comparable studies, the authors found no significant increase in LDL cholesterol.

Rather, the ""good"" cholesterol increased only on the very-high-fat diet.

""These results indicate that most healthy people probably tolerate a high intake of saturated fat well, as long as the fat quality is good and total energy intake is not too high. It may even be healthy,"" says Ottar Nygård.

""Future studies should examine which people or patients may need to limit their intake of saturated fat,"" assistant professor Simon Nitter Dankel points out, who led the study together with the director of the laboratory clinics, professor Gunnar Mellgren, at Haukeland university hospital in Bergen, Norway.

""But the alleged health risks of eating good-quality fats have been greatly exaggerated. It may be more important for public health to encourage reductions in processed flour-based products, highly processed fats and foods with added sugar,"" he says.

Facts: The FATFUNC-study"	Saturated fat could be good for you	2016-12-29 06:00:00	https://web.archive.org/web/20161203145445/https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-12/tuob-sfc120216.php	news_reviews_00321	fake
"An experimental Ebola vaccine was highly protective against the deadly virus in a major trial in Guinea, according to results published today in The Lancet. The vaccine is the first to prevent infection from one of the most lethal known pathogens, and the findings add weight to early trial results published last year. [1]

The vaccine, called rVSV-ZEBOV [2], was studied in a trial involving 11,841 people in Guinea during 2015. Among the 5,837 people who received the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded 10 days or more after vaccination [3]. In comparison, there were 23 cases 10 days or more after vaccination among those who did not receive the vaccine.

The trial was led by the World Health Organization, together with Guinea's Ministry of Health and other international partners.

""While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa's Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenceless,"" said Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO's Assistant Director-General for Health Systems and Innovation, and the study's lead author [4].

The vaccine's manufacturer, Merck, Sharpe & Dohme, this year received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration and PRIME status from the European Medicines Agency, enabling faster regulatory review of the vaccine once it is submitted.

Since Ebola virus was first identified in 1976, sporadic outbreaks have been reported in Africa. But the 2013-2016 West African Ebola outbreak, which resulted in more than 11,300 deaths, highlighted the need for a vaccine.

The trial took place in the coastal region of Basse-Guinée, the area of Guinea still experiencing new Ebola cases when the trial started in 2015. The trial used an innovative design, a so-called ""ring vaccination"" approach - the same method used to eradicate small pox.

When a new Ebola case was diagnosed, the research team traced all people who may have been in contact with that case within the previous 3 weeks, such as people who lived in the same household, were visited by the patient, or were in close contact with the patient, their clothes or linen, as well as certain ""contacts of contacts"". A total of 117 clusters (or ""rings"") were identified, each made up of an average of 80 people.

Initially, rings were randomised to receive the vaccine either immediately or after a 3-week delay, and only adults over 18 years were offered the vaccine. After interim results were published showing the vaccine's efficacy, all rings were offered the vaccine immediately and the trial was also opened to children older than 6 years.

In addition to showing high efficacy among those vaccinated, the trial also shows that unvaccinated people in the rings were indirectly protected from Ebola virus through the ring vaccination approach (so-called ""herd immunity""). However, the authors note that the trial was not designed to measure this effect, so more research will be needed.

""Ebola left a devastating legacy in our country. We are proud that we have been able to contribute to developing a vaccine that will prevent other nations from enduring what we endured"" said Dr KeÏta Sakoba, Coordinator of the Ebola Response and Director of the National Agency for Health Security in Guinea [4].

To assess safety, people who received the vaccine were observed for 30 minutes after vaccination, and at repeated home visits up to 12 weeks later. Approximately half reported mild symptoms soon after vaccination, including headache, fatigue and muscle pain but recovered within days without long-term effects. Two serious adverse events were judged to be related to vaccination (a febrile reaction and one anaphylaxis) and one was judged to be possibly related (influenza-like illness). All three recovered without any long term effects.

It was not possible to collect biological samples from people who received the vaccine in order to analyse their immune response. Other studies are looking at the immune response to the vaccine including one conducted in parallel to the ring trial among frontline Ebola workers in Guinea.

""This both historical and innovative trial was made possible thanks to exemplary international collaboration and coordination, the contribution of many experts worldwide, and strong local involvement,"" said Dr John-Arne Røttingen, Specialist Director at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, and the chairman of the study steering group [4].

In January, GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance provided US$5 million to Merck towards the future procurement of the vaccine once it is approved, prequalified and recommended by WHO. As part of this agreement, Merck committed to ensure that 300,000 doses of the vaccine are available for emergency use in the interim, and to submit the vaccine for licensure by the end of 2017. Merck has also submitted the vaccine to WHO's Emergency Use and Assessment Listing procedure, a mechanism through which experimental vaccines, medicines and diagnostics can be made available for use prior to formal licensure.

Additional studies are ongoing to provide more data on the safety of the vaccine in children and other vulnerable populations such as people with HIV. In case of Ebola flare-ups prior to approval, access to the vaccine is being made available through a procedure called ""compassionate use"" that enables use of the vaccine after informed consent. Merck and WHO's partners are working to compile data to support license applications.

The rapid development of rVSV-EBOV contributed to the development of WHO's R&D; Blueprint, a global strategy to fast-track the development of effective tests, vaccines and medicines during epidemics.

Also published in The Lancet (embargo as above), is a phase 2 trial of a different Ebola vaccine candidate, the recombinant adenovirus type-5 Ebola vaccine. The trial was led by the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology and was conducted in Sierra Leone in 2015. It involved 500 healthy participants, followed for 6 months - 250 were given a high dose vaccine, 125 a low-dose and 125 a placebo. The study found that the vaccine was safe and induced an immune response that peaked at 28 days, but decreased during the six months post injection. One serious adverse event was reported, in an individual with a history of asthma. Further research on this vaccine is needed in order to assess its efficacy.

[2] VSV-EBOV was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada. The vaccine was licensed to NewLink Genetics, who in turn licensed it to Merck & Co. The vaccine works by replacing a gene from a harmless virus known as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) with a gene encoding an Ebola virus surface protein. The vaccine does not contain any live Ebola virus. Earlier trials have shown the vaccine to be protective in animals, and be safe and produce an immune response in humans.

[3] Analysis only included cases occurring 10 days after receiving the vaccine to account for the incubation period of the Ebola virus.

"A new non-surgical treatment for low-risk prostate cancer can effectively kill cancer cells while preserving healthy tissue, reports a new UCL-led phase III clinical trial in 413 patients. The trial was funded by STEBA Biotech which holds the commercial license for the treatment.

The new treatment, 'vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy' (VTP), involves injecting a light-sensitive drug into the bloodstream and then activating it with a laser to destroy tumour tissue in the prostate. The research, published in The Lancet Oncology, found that around half (49%) of patients treated with VTP went into complete remission compared with 13.5% in the control group.

""These results are excellent news for men with early localised prostate cancer, offering a treatment that can kill cancer without removing or destroying the prostate,"" says lead investigator Professor Mark Emberton, Dean of UCL Medical Sciences and Consultant Urologist at UCLH. ""This is truly a huge leap forward for prostate cancer treatment, which has previously lagged decades behind other solid cancers such as breast cancer. In 1975 almost everyone with breast cancer was given a radical mastectomy, but since then treatments have steady improved and we now rarely need to remove the whole breast. In prostate cancer we are still commonly removing or irradiating the whole prostate, so the success of this new tissue-preserving treatment is welcome news indeed.""

At the moment, men with low-risk prostate cancer are put under 'active surveillance' where the disease is monitored and only treated when it becomes more severe. Radical therapy, which involves surgically removing or irradiating the whole prostate, has significant long-term side effects so is only used to treat high-risk cancers.

Radical therapy causes lifelong erectile problems and around one in five patients also suffer from incontinence. By contrast, VTP only caused short-term urinary and erectile problems which resolved within three months, and no significant side-effects remained after two years.

In the trial only 6% of patients treated with VTP needed radical therapy compared with 30% of patients in the control arm who were under active surveillance. The chances of cancer progressing to a more dangerous stage were three times lower for patients on VTP, and the treatment doubled the average time to progression from 14 months to 28 months.

The trial involved 47 treatment sites from ten different European countries, most of which were performing VTP for the first time.

""The fact that the treatment was performed so successfully by non-specialist centres in various health systems is really remarkable,"" says Professor Emberton, who is supported by the National Institute for Health Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre. ""New procedures are generally associated with a learning curve, but the lack of complications in the trial suggests that the treatment protocol is safe, efficient and relatively easy to scale up. We would also expect the treatment to be far more precise if we repeated it today, as technology has come a long way since the study began in 2011.

""We can now pinpoint prostate cancers using MRI scans and targeted biopsies, allowing a much more targeted approach to diagnosis and treatment. This means we could accurately identify men who would benefit from VTP and deliver treatment more precisely to the tumour. With such an approach we should be able to achieve a significantly higher remission rate than in the trial and send nearly all low-risk localised prostate cancers into remission. We also hope that VTP will be effective against other types of cancer - the treatment was developed for prostate cancer because of the urgent need for new therapies, but it should be translatable to other solid cancers including breast and liver cancer.""

The VTP therapy approach was developed by scientists at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel in collaboration with STEBA Biotech, and the European phase I, II and III trials were all led by UCL. The drug used in the procedure, WST11, is derived from bacteria at the bottom of the ocean. To survive with very little sunlight, they have evolved to convert light into energy with incredible efficiency. This property has been exploited to develop WST11, a compound that releases free radicals to kill surrounding cells when activated by laser light.

One of the first people to be treated with VTP was UCLH patient Gerald, a man in his sixties who took part in the latest trial under the care of Professor Emberton. He says:

""When I was diagnosed with early prostate cancer, I had the option of active surveillance but I didn't want to wait until it got worse so when I was offered a place on the trial I signed up straight away. Some men prefer to delay treatment, but I couldn't live with the fear of the cancer spreading until it either couldn't be treated or needed a treatment that would stop me living a normal life.

""The treatment I received on the trial changed my life. I'm now cancer-free with no side-effects and don't have to worry about needing surgery in future. I feel so lucky to be in this position. I've met other men who had surgery - they had to stay in hospital for days whereas I could go home the next day, and one suffered from terrible incontinence which he found very distressing. I had some minor side-effects for a few weeks after the operation, but I'm back to normal now. I am incredibly grateful to Professor Mark Emberton and his team for the excellent care that I received, and I hope that other patients will be able to benefit from this treatment in future.""

The VTP treatment is currently being reviewed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), so it is likely to be a number of years before it can be offered to patients more widely.

"PITTSBURGH, Dec. 1, 2016 - In the first analysis of how to treat patients on anticoagulants who suffer a major bleeding event, a clinical practice that routinely gives doctors pause, while also evaluating a new drug, University of Pittsburgh researchers aim to provide much-needed guidance to clinicians trying to balance the risks of stroke versus bleeding when determining the best treatment.

The analysis, published today in the journal Stroke, determined that resuming anticoagulation therapy after a person suffers a major bleeding event was associated with a higher likelihood of stroke-free survival than discontinuing anticoagulation. Furthermore, restarting therapy with the new oral anticoagulant dabigatran was associated with a lower risk of recurrent hemorrhage in these cases than the old standby drug warfarin.

People take anticoagulants to avoid blood clots when they have a risk for stroke or heart attack, but the downside is that these medications increase a person's risk of severe bleeding--such as in the brain or gut--because the blood isn't clotting as well as it otherwise might.

""If a patient who is on an anticoagulant to avoid a stroke has a major bleeding event, doctors are faced with a catch-22: Discontinue the anticoagulant to avoid future bleeding, but again place their patient at increased risk of stroke; or resume the anticoagulant to continue avoiding a stroke, but then have to worry about another bleeding event,"" said lead author Inmaculada Hernandez, Pharm.D., Ph.D., an assistant professor in Pitt's School of Pharmacy, who completed this work as a doctoral student at Pitt's Graduate School of Public Health.

""It causes a lot of uncertainty for physicians, especially because patients at highest risk of recurrent bleeding also are at highest risk of stroke,"" said co-author Yuting Zhang, Ph.D., associate professor of health policy and management at Pitt Public Health, and Hernandez's doctoral dissertation committee chair.

The Pitt research team obtained data from 2010 to 2012 for a random sample of Medicare beneficiaries. They then followed nearly 90,000 people who had filled prescriptions for the anticoagulants warfarin, which has been used as a medication since 1954, and dabigatran, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2010. More than 1,500 of those people suffered a major bleeding event while using one of the drugs. About half of those people resumed one of the two anticoagulants a few months after the bleeding, while the others did not.

The risk of dying from any cause or having a stroke was 23 to 34 percent higher in patients who discontinued anticoagulation therapy compared to those who resumed it. People who took dabigatran after their initial bleeding event had nearly half the risk of another major bleeding event within one year compared with those who took warfarin.

""Our results should encourage clinicians to seriously consider resuming anticoagulation among patients who survived a major bleeding event, particularly if the source of bleeding was identified and addressed,"" said senior author Samir Saba, M.D., associate professor of medicine and associate chief of cardiology at UPMC Heart and Vascular Institute. ""They should also take into account that the benefit-to-risk ratio of post-hemorrhage use of anticoagulation is not the same for all medications.""

"WHAT: A new study shows that the drug fenofibrate might reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes who have high levels of triglycerides and low levels of ""good"" cholesterol, despite being treated with statins. The study, funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), appears in the December 28 issue of JAMA Cardiology.

Fenofibrate is primarily used to help reduce elevated levels of triglycerides, or fat, in the blood. But the researchers wanted to know if the drug, when combined with statin treatment, could also reduce the risk of heart disease in people with type 2 diabetes. People with type 2 diabetes are at high risk of cardiovascular-related events, such as heart attacks, stroke, and even death, often because their levels of triglycerides are so high, and their high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels are low.

To answer their question, the researchers followed 4,640 participants from the NHLBI-funded Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) Lipid Study for five years after the conclusion of the trial in 2009. The findings suggest that fenofibrate therapy may be beneficial in the way the researchers hoped: by reducing cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes who take statins but still have especially high triglycerides levels and low HDL cholesterol levels. However, a randomized study is needed to confirm these findings, according to the authors.

"- Shows Efficacy at 12 Weeks of Treatment

- Sun Pharma is Developing Seciera™ for Global Markets

Sun Pharma announced successful Phase 3 confirmatory clinical trial results for Seciera™ (cyclosporine A, 0.09% ophthalmic solution), for the treatment of dry eye disease. Seciera™ is a patented, novel, proprietary nanomicellar formulation of cyclosporine A 0.09%. It is a clear, preservative-free, aqueous solution. Seciera™ is being developed by Ocular Technologies, a company recently acquired by Sun Pharma. Following this acquisition, Sun Pharma owns exclusive, worldwide rights to Seciera™ and is developing it to commercialize for global markets including US, Europe, and Japan, as well as several emerging markets.

(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160711/813488 )



In this 12 week, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, vehicle controlled Phase 3 confirmatory study, 744 dry eye patients were treated either with Seciera™, or its vehicle. After 12 weeks of treatment, as compared to vehicle, Seciera™ showed statistically significant improvement in the primary end point, Schirmer's score (a measurement of tear production) (p<0.0001). The demonstration of efficacy by Seciera™ at 12 weeks is earlier than other drugs approved for dry eye in the same class.[1] Additionally, several key secondary endpoints showed statistically significant improvements compared to vehicle with some showing an even earlier onset of action. Adverse events reported in the trial were mild to moderate in nature and similar to other approved drugs in the category.[1]-[3] As Sun continues to analyze the data, additional significant findings will be shared at upcoming medical conferences.

Previously, in a completed Phase 2b/3 clinical trial in 455 patients, Seciera™ demonstrated a rapid onset of action and was well tolerated by the study population. Based on published data, the efficacy and safety endpoints in these trials compared favorably to other formulations of cyclosporine A with the advantage of early onset.[1]

According to Dilip Shanghvi, Managing Director, Sun Pharma, ""We are happy to see the early onset of action and strong efficacy results for Seciera™. These results are highly encouraging for millions of Dry Eye patients[4]-[6] across the globe that have yet to find relief for their condition. We look forward to discussing these results with US FDA and agree on next steps for the program.""

""I am very excited to see these strong results for Seciera™,"" noted Dr. Joseph Tauber, Study Investigator and founder of the Tauber Eye Center, Kansas City, Missouri. ""As a clinician who specializes in diagnosing and treating dry eye, this novel formulation of cyclosporine A would be a unique and welcome addition to our armamentarium to treat these patients"".

Jerry St. Peter, Vice President and Head of Sun Ophthalmics, added: ""A key strategic imperative for our ophthalmic business is to participate in the rapidly growing, underserved, and dynamic Dry Eye market, which is expected to reach $5 billion by 2020.[7] Based on this successful confirmatory Phase 3 trial, Seciera™ has the potential to strengthen our emerging ophthalmics pipeline, which includes the recent launch of BromSite™ and late stage development programs for Xelpros™ and DexaSite™.""

"On a scale of 1 to 10, lower back pain can register somewhere between ""I need an aspirin"" to “please jack me up with morphine.”

Those suffering from such discomfort might feel moderate to mild pain that is not debilitating. In severe cases, they could feel like a giant electrified claw has claimed the lower part of their back, tearing into each nerve in that part of the body. The smallest of movements – getting up from a chair, walking or even coughing – can feel torturous. Maybe the lower back is as stiff as hardened concrete and as sensitive as an exposed nerve.

A simple lumbar support device, or back brace, can provide short-term relief, research shows, according to an analysis of 28 studies published in the September 2016 issue of the Annals of Physical Rehabilitation Medicine journal. While these devices won’t cure the underlying condition, they're simple and relatively inexpensive. In the 2016 meta-analysis, researchers concluded that lumbar support devices are useful for improving function and reducing pain among those suffering from subacute back pain, which means it's past the acute stage – which is sudden and short in duration – but not long-lasting enough to be chronic.

“Lumbar support devices provide enough compression and support for the lower back to allow healing to occur,” says Christopher Cousins, a physical therapist based in the District of Columbia. “The compression on the abdomen means there’s less pressure on your lower back discs, ligaments, muscles and spine.”

Lumbar devices typically fit around your waist and are secured with Velcro. They often have a steel or plastic plate attached to the section that would press against the patient’s lower back to provide support; some have over-the-shoulders straps. Most over-the-counter lumbar support devices cost between $25 and $130, and they're available at many drug stores, Target and Wal-Mart, plus online without a a prescription. Custom-made lumbar support devices, which are contoured to the natural curvature of the patient’s spine, cost from a few hundred dollars to about $1,000, Cousins says.

People who suffer mild to moderate subacute back pain should put on a back brace as soon as their discomfort sets in, says Scott Bautch, a chiropractor in Wasau, Wisconsin, and president of the American Chiropractic Association's council on occupational health. ""You want to give yourself bracing so you can move,"" Bautch says. ""Inactivity or immobilization is the worst thing for a back. You want to remain active, and a brace can help you do that.""

Some studies have shown that wearing a lumbar support device could lead to negative effects, such as skin lesions, muscle wasting, gastrointestinal disorders, higher blood pressure and higher heart rates. Those issues are rare and typically occur with people who wear a back brace for an extended period of time, for more than the week or two most experts recommend, Bautch says. If a back brace fits well, is worn properly – that is, it's not too snug – and is not overused, it shouldn't create any health problems, Bautch says. During the course of his 30-year career, Bautch says, hundreds of his patients have worn lumbar support devices. None of them developed any problems, aside from a handful who had minor skin irritation where part of the brace rubbed their body, Bautch says. He remedied that issue by having his patients wear an undershirt between the lumbar support device and their skin.

Searing, subacute back pain is caused by an array of conditions, including a herniated disc, in which the soft, jelly-like center inside the disc pushes out through a tear in its tough exterior and irritates nerves. A herniated disc can cause sciatica, a painful condition that affects the back, hips and legs and is caused by the compression of a spinal nerve root in the lower back. Spinal discs degenerate with age, and a herniated disc can occur without a physical injury, says Dr. Neel Anand, director of spine trauma at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. ""Think of your disc like your car tire – it's going to wear out,"" Anand says.

Before getting a lumbar support device for your lower back pain, experts recommend these steps:

1. If you have severe pain, see a physician quickly. If your back pain or stiffness is so bad you can't move without tremendous discomfort, see a doctor as soon as possible, Bautch says. If your pain and stiffness are that severe, a back brace may not be of much immediate use, he says, adding that it may be helpful once the pain and stiffness subside to a tolerable level where you can move.

Moderate to mild lower back pain often subsides after five days or so, but if your discomfort persists beyond that or worsens, see a doctor, adds Dr. Megan Cortazzo, medical director of clinical documentation improvement and health information management at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. A doctor can test for and rule out serious potential causes, such as kidney stones, an abdominal aneurysm and cancer, Cortazzo says. Doctors can order an array of tests, such as an X-ray, MRI or CT scan, to arrive at the correct diagnosis, which will help lead to the most effective treatment plan, she says. The goal of most treatment regimens is strengthening the patient's core muscles supporting the spine so the pain doesn't recur. Treatment could include physical therapy, a stretching routine, yoga or Pilates. Many people also find chiropractic adjustments helpful, says Robert Hayden, a chiropractor based in Griffin, Georgia.

2. Find a lumbar support device that fits you. Once you've been diagnosed, look for a lumbar support device that fits the natural curvature of your spine, says Dr. Jeremy Smith, an orthopedic spine surgeon at the Hoag Orthopedic Institute in Irvine, California. Try on a few at the store before buying one, he advises. If you buy the device online, you can return it if it doesn't fit. “It needs to naturally contour and fit, kind of like a glove, so all surface areas are in contact with your back. It should help remind you to keep good posture,” Smith says. “The device should be snug, but not too tight. It shouldn’t constrict your breathing.”

3. Don’t become reliant on your back brace. Patients should wear a back brace for no longer than a few days to two weeks at the most, Bautch says. “Longer than that, and your muscles start to adapt and get accustomed to the brace, which means they can lose strength, which can lead to more injuries,” he adds. “If you use the back brace for more than two weeks, you can become brace-dependent.” A lumbar support device can be useful in the short term, but strengthening the core muscles that support your back is important in the long run, Bautch says.

4. Learn your capacity. Figure out your physical limits to avoid reinjuring your back – both when you're wearing a back brace and after you've stopped using it, says Robert Shapiro, a physical therapist and certified orthopedic manual therapist based in Huntington, New York. ""You're not Superman when you're wearing your brace,"" he says. Exceeding your physical boundaries could cause a recurrence of low back pain. “You have to learn what your limits are and not to exceed them,” Shapiro says. “You may be able to lift a box of books, but shoveling snow may cause pain. Your physical limits may change as you exercise and strengthen your core.”"	Can Lumbar Support Devices Relieve Lower Back Pain?	2017-01-05 06:00:00	http://health.usnews.com/wellness/articles/2017-01-05/can-lumbar-support-devices-relieve-lower-back-pain	story_reviews_00305	true
"(Reuters Health) - Cardiac arrest patients who get cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) from a bystander at the scene may have better survival odds even when an ambulance takes a long time to arrive, a Danish study suggests.

Researchers examined data on 7,623 cardiac arrest patients and found when an ambulance arrived within five minutes of a 911 call, patients were 2.3 times more likely to survive at least 30 days if they received bystander CPR than if they didn’t get this aid at the scene.

When ambulances took up to 10 minutes to arrive, bystander CPR was associated with tripled survival odds, the study also found. After 13 minutes, patients who got CPR at the scene continued to have better survival odds but the difference was no longer statistically meaningful.

“Early CPR saves lives, and the lack of CPR efforts from bystanders could result in significantly decreased chances of survival,” said lead study author Dr. Shahzleen Rajan of Copenhagen University Hospital in Denmark.

Cardiac arrest involves the abrupt loss of heart function, breathing and consciousness. Unlike a heart attack, which happens when blood flow to a portion of the heart is blocked, cardiac arrest occurs when the heart’s electrical system malfunctions, often due to irregular heart rhythms. Cardiac arrest may occur with no warning and is often fatal.

Chest compressions or CPR can help restore circulation, increasing the odds of survival. Bystander CPR generally won’t restore a normal heart rhythm but it can buy time by maintaining blood flow to vital organs.

“We know from previous research that 1 in 8 people survive after a cardiac arrest if a bystander initiates CPR before the arrival of the emergency medical services,” Rajan said by email. “In contrast, if CPR is not initiated before the arrival of the emergency medical services, only 1 in 30 people survive a cardiac arrest.”

For the current study, researchers looked at 30-day survival for patients who had cardiac arrests outside of a hospital between 2005 and 2011.

When the ambulance arrived within five minutes, 14.5 percent of patients in the bystander CPR group survived at least 30 days, compared with 6.3 percent in the group that didn’t get this help.

For ambulance arrival times up to ten minutes, 6.7 percent in the CPR group and 2.2 percent of the other patients survived. If the ambulance took more than 13 minutes, the survival rate was 3.7 percent in the CPR group and 1.5 percent for the others - a difference that wasn’t statistically meaningful.

The study is observational and doesn’t prove bystander CPR increases survival odds, the authors note in Circulation. Researchers also lacked data on how quickly bystanders intervened after the start of cardiac arrest, which could influence outcomes, the authors note.

“Once a victim has sustained a cardiac arrest with little or no blood supply going to the heart or brain, the time to reestablishing blood flow with oxygenated blood is critical,” said Dr. Lenworth Jacobs, director of trauma and emergency medicine at Hartford Hospital in Connecticut.

“It is generally thought that the sooner this is implemented the better,” Jacobs, who wasn’t involved in the study, added by email.

The biggest obstacle to bystander CPR remains that too few people know how to do it, said Dr. Peter Pons, an emergency physician in Denver and professor emeritus at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.

“Clearly, if someone has been motivated to learn and has been taught CPR, they will often assist,” Pons, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “When someone does not have that knowledge, they tend to be more reluctant to act and may fear making things worse.”

"Risk of early death is as low for those who meet recommended activity targets in one or two sessions a week as it is for daily exercisers, study shows

People who cram all their exercise into one or two sessions at the weekend benefit nearly as much as those who work out more frequently, researchers say.



A study of more than 60,000 adults in England and Scotland found that “weekend warriors” lowered their risk of death by a similar margin to those who spread the same amount of exercise over the whole week.



The findings will reassure people who find it hard to make time for a daily exercise routine and opt instead to break a sweat once or twice a week in the hope of keeping fit.

“Millions of people enjoy doing sport once or twice a week, but they may be concerned that they are not doing enough,” said Gary O’Donovan, a physical activity researcher and author on the study at Loughborough University. “We find a clear benefit. It’s making them fit and healthy.”



The UK’s National Health Service recommends that to ward off an early death, people should spend 150 minutes a week performing moderate exercise, or 75 minutes a week doing vigorous exercise. As a rule of thumb, moderate exercise can be done while maintaining a conversation, whereas during vigorous exercise talking at the same time is too hard.



In the study, those who met the physical activity target by exercising through the week had a 35% lower risk of death than the inactive adults, with cardiovascular deaths down 41% and a 21% lower risk of cancer death.



But the weekend warriors also saw substantial health benefits if they met the physical activity target too. Their overall risk of death was 30% lower than the sedentary adults, with the risk of cardiovascular and cancer deaths lower by 40% and 18% respectively.

“Weekend warriors are people who meet the recommended volume of physical activity each week through only one or two sessions. There are doing a large proportion of vigorous exercise and that makes you fitter than moderate exercise,” said O’Donovan. Men and women benefited equally, according to the study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association: Internal Medicine.



The results are based on medical data gathered for 63,591 adults aged 40 and above between 1994 and 2012. Nearly 9,000 of the study participants died in the period.



For those who have resolved to get fit in the New Year, O’Donovan recommends to start with moderate exercise, such as brisk walking, and then to set realistic, incremental goals to boost confidence without running the risk of setbacks due to injury. “A middle aged or older person should do as much as 12 weeks of moderate exercise before introducing vigorous exercise,” he said.



Ulf Ekelund at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences in Oslo said the study emphasised what researchers have found time and again: that even a small amount of regular exercise wards off death. In the study, those who exercised a little had a 29% lower risk of death than those who did no exercise at all. “The novel finding is that it appears the duration, and possibly the intensity, of leisure time physical activity is more important than the frequency,” Ekelund said.



“My take home message is that the greatest risk reduction and the greatest gain for the individual and for public health is if those who are physically inactive take up some activity,” he added.

"It’s the person who wakes up at the crack of dawn on the weekend, puts on shiny spandex and disappears with a mountain bike for hours at a time. It’s the guy who heads to the pool one night a week and endures a workout that might make Michael Phelps gasp for air. It’s the weekly rock climbers and double spin class-takers schvitzing their Sunday away. These weekend warriors cram the recommended amount of exercise into one or two days, while the rest of us faithfully head to the gym multiple times a week for a half-hour hamster run on the treadmill.

A paper published January 9 in JAMA Internal Medicine suggests these warriors may be onto something. In a study based on nearly 64,000 adults, researchers in the U.K. found that weekend exercise appears to be just as effective at preventing heart disease and cancer as exercise done more frequently. This is great news for anyone who feels too busy on weekdays to work out but enjoys outdoor activity on the weekend.

“I think that the weekend warrior physical activity pattern is beneficial because they are actually doing a large proportion of vigorous intensity activity. And vigorous activity makes you fit, and fitness reduces your risk of disease and death,” says Gary O’Donovan, a researcher in physical activity and sedentary behavior at England’s Loughborough University and lead author of the paper.

O’Donovan and fellow researchers looked at data on middle-aged adults who responded to a government-sponsored household survey conducted from 1994 to 2012. The survey included questions about health history and fitness habits. The researchers then cross-referenced this information with health department death records.

They found the risk of death from all causes was about 30 percent lower for weekend warriors, compared with adults who maintained a sedentary lifestyle. And the warriors had a 40 percent lower risk of cardiovascular death and an 18 percent lower risk for cancer-related death. The mortality rates of weekend warriors were roughly the same as those who claimed to exercise more than two days a week but for shorter durations.

However, there are also some limitations to this study, the researchers say. More than 90 percent of the subjects were white. The information about physical activity was reported by the participants, and it’s likely that many were too generous in their estimates of how much time they spent at the gym. Unfortunately, taking 20 minutes in locker room to put on your sneakers doesn’t count as a workout.

It’s recommended that people get 150 minutes (or two and half hours) of exercise each week, based on guidelines from the American Heart Association, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other medical authorities. This could be something as simple as a brisk walk or other low-impact options for vigorous exercise about 20 minutes a day. (Experts often encourage recreational athletes to not exercise more than an hour a day.) “In theory, someone who did one bout of 150 minutes of moderate exercise is a weekend warrior,” says O’Donovan.

This study shows that it doesn’t matter how you decide to split up the recommended weekly amount of exercise. You just need to do it.

However, experts caution that it is possible to overdo it, and more exercise than two and a half hours a week can actually be unhelpful and even harmful. One study, published in 2014 in the journal Heart, suggests that in people with existing heart disease, the risk for cardiac arrest and stroke was the same for people who exercised more than an hour a day compared with those who didn’t exercise at all. The coronary heart disease patients who stuck with the recommended 150 minutes a week had the lowest risk for heart attack and stroke.

There are risks that come with a weekend warrior exercise schedule, especially for people who aren’t used to being active. “I would be more concerned about what’s happening at the point of exercise—not the long-term benefits,” says Dr. Howard Andrew Selinger, chair of family medicine at Quinnipiac University. He says someone who is not in good shape is at risk for sudden cardiac arrest or acute injury, such as spraining muscles or putting too much stress on joints.

O’Donovan encourages aspiring weekend warriors to start slowly to avoid any health problems. He says middle-aged adults should exercise moderately during the first 12 weeks and then slowly build up to more vigorous activity."	‘Weekend Warrior’ Workouts are Beneficial as Just 20 Minutes of Exercise a Day	2017-01-09 18:52:31	https://web.archive.org/web/20170110103938/http://www.newsweek.com/weekend-warrior-recommended-daily-exercise-workouts-20-minutes-540467	story_reviews_00303	true

TUESDAY, Jan. 17, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Because of stringent tonsillectomy guidelines, some kids who could benefit from tonsil removal surgery aren't getting it, two new reviews suggest.

To qualify for the surgery, a child must have many recurring throat infections within a short span of time or severe sleep disturbances, said Dr. Sivakumar Chinnadurai, a co-author of the reviews.

An evaluation of current medical evidence suggests more kids would receive significant short-term improvement in their daily life if the guidelines were relaxed, said Chinnadurai, a pediatric otolaryngologist with Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.

Children experienced nearly half as many sore throats when they underwent a tonsillectomy, even if they didn't meet the guidelines, Chinnadurai and his colleagues found. The kids also missed fewer days of school and were less likely to need medical care.

However, this strong benefit only applies to the first couple of years following surgery, Chinnadurai said. By the third year, there was no clear benefit in terms of the number of throat infections. Also, there was limited research on long-term results.

""The decision about whether those children should have tonsillectomy for that temporary benefit is really tied to what those children need or what they're suffering with,"" Chinnadurai said. Kids who miss a lot of school or need frequent trips to the doctor due to sore throats could benefit from the surgery, he said.

There's an even clearer benefit for kids whose sleep is disturbed due to inflamed tonsils, Chinnadurai said.

""In a child with a diagnosis of sleep apnea, we can see a benefit in sleep-related quality of life,"" he said. The kids get better sleep, and thus exhibit better everyday behavior and pay more attention in school.

The medical approach to treating tonsil infections has evolved over recent decades.

Tonsillectomy is the third most common surgery performed on U.S. children, with 530,000 such procedures completed each year, according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology -- Head and Neck Surgery.

Thirty years ago, nine out of 10 tonsillectomies in children were performed to treat recurring throat infections. These days, the procedure is done 20 percent of the time for infections and 80 percent of the time for sleep problems, according to the academy.

Swollen tonsils can block the airway during sleep, causing breathing problems that range from simple snoring to obstructive sleep apnea, the researchers said in background notes.

Guidelines say a tonsillectomy to treat throat infections is justified if a child had seven or more sore throats during the previous year; five or more sore throats two years running, or three or more sore throats for three years in a row, according to the background notes.

The researchers decided to review whether the throat infection guidelines are too stringent, ruling out patients who potentially could benefit but don't meet the high threshold of recurring infections, Chinnadurai said.

There aren't strong guidelines regarding the use of tonsillectomy to treat sleep disorders, so the doctors reviewed the evidence to see whether the surgery outperformed so-called watchful waiting -- monitoring the situation.

The study results showed ""there may be new evidence that supports expanding the criteria and opening up the procedure to more individuals,"" said Dr. Alyssa Hackett, an otolaryngologist with the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai in New York City.

""In the right child with the right indications, these are really wonderful procedures that can be life-changing for both the child and the family,"" said Hackett, who wasn't involved with the new research.

""If you need your appendix out, you need your appendix out,"" Hackett said. ""But for the tonsils and adenoids, there are great quality-of-life benefits that are evident for the surgery, but no child has ever died because they haven't gone through the surgery."" (Adenoids, glands at the roof of the mouth, are often removed along with tonsils.)

Still, Chinnadurai and Hackett warned against automatically choosing the surgery for every sore throat.

About 3 percent of kids who undergo the procedure experience bleeding during the two-week recovery period, Hackett said.

""Though a tonsillectomy is low-risk, it is not risk-free, and those risks need to be weighed against the benefits for each individual child,"" Chinnadurai said.

""We're talking about a child who has significant sleep-related issues,"" Hackett said. ""We don't want people to say my child snores, they need to have their tonsils out. That's not what this study says at all.""

The two reports were published online Jan. 17 in the journal Pediatrics.

"Kangaroo Care Helps Preemies And Full Term Babies, Too

Enlarge this image toggle caption Morgan Walker for NPR Morgan Walker for NPR

When Ali Andrew Li was born on Jan. 7, he was gently placed on his mother's chest, where doctors cleaned and examined him and covered him with a warm blanket.

""I just loved it,"" his mother, Salma Shabaik, a family physician who lives in Los Angeles, says. ""It was really nice to have the baby right there beneath my eyes where I could feel him, touch him, kiss him.""

That was different than the birth of her son Elias two years ago; he was whisked away to a bassinet to be examined. And unlike Elias, who cried a lot after delivery, Shabaik says Ali stopped crying ""within seconds"" after being placed on her chest.

Kangaroo mother care has been widely used worldwide to care for premature babies, and it's gaining popularity in caring for healthy full term babies like Ali as well. It is as it sounds: Like a kangaroo's pouch, mothers hold their naked newborns on their bare chest for the first few hours of life.

At Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center where Ali was born, the technique is routinely practiced for healthy mothers and newborns. The baby gets to know their mother immediately, says Dr. Larry Gray, behavioral and developmental pediatrician at Comer Children's Hospital, University of Chicago Medicine. ""The baby gets landed in a trusting environment,"" he says, reassuring them that life outside the womb can also be ""soft, comfortable and warm.""

The benefits are many, according to Dr. Lydia Kyung-Min Lee, an ob-gyn at UCLA. Not only is the baby happier, she says, but his or her vitals are more stable. Body temperature, heart and breathing rate normalize more quickly. The close contact also allows the baby to be exposed to the same bacteria as the mother, which can protect against allergies and infection in the future. Infants who receive kangaroo care breast feed more easily, Lee says, and their mothers tend to breast feed for longer periods of time, which is ""all good.""

Babies also seem to suffer less pain. Almost 20 years ago, Gray studied how babies respond to a heel prick to draw blood, a procedure that screens newborns for genetic disorders. He found that when healthy newborns had kangaroo care, there was less facial grimacing and crying suggesting pain, compared to babies who had been swaddled and had the procedure in their bassinets, ""sort of alone.""

One of the first places to show how this technique can help preemies was Colombia in the 1990s. There, hospitals with no access to incubators and other equipment often sent home preemies with no expectation that they would live. But doctors were surprised to see that babies whose mothers carried them close, skin to skin, not only survived but thrived.

This was a ""serendipitous magical finding,"" says Gray, suggesting that skin-to-skin contact acted something like a ""natural incubator.""

Gray also points to the work of Myron Hofer, a psychiatrist with Columbia University Medical Center who studies attachment between mother and infants. Hofer coined the term ""hidden regulators"" that pass between mother and baby. It's not just that mother and baby are together, Gray says, but also that the mother is in some way ""programming the baby, the breathing, temperature and heart rate.""

That ""magic"" can also happen between baby and father, too, says Gray, if there's skin-to-skin contact. And if mothers or babies are very sick and have to be isolated, Gray suggests mothers take any opportunity to hold their infant skin to skin. Even a little bit of kangaroo contact, he says, can be beneficial."

WEDNESDAY, Jan. 25, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Just how successful is the procedure called catheter ablation at fixing irregular heartbeats that can be potentially fatal?

Pretty successful, a new study found, but there are caveats.

Burning or freezing specific areas of the heart can alleviate the common irregular heart beat called atrial fibrillation in 74 percent of patients. However, the procedure doesn't work for everyone and there are risks of complications, researchers report.

Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of early death by two times in women and 1.5 times in men. It causes 20 to 30 percent of all strokes and can decrease quality of life due to palpitations, shortness of breath, tiredness, weakness and psychological distress, the study authors explained.

About 2.7 million Americans suffer from atrial fibrillation, according to the American Heart Association.

For those whose atrial fibrillation can't be controlled with medications, catheter ablation may be recommended.

""Catheter ablation is a valid alternative for the management of atrial fibrillation with a satisfactory success rate,"" said study lead researcher Dr. Elena Arbelo.

But the procedure can have complications, which should be considered carefully by doctors and patients, said Arbelo, a senior specialist in the Cardiovascular Institute at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona in Spain.

Complications can include fluid buildup around the heart, called cardiac tamponade, which makes it difficult for the heart to pump blood. Other complications include stroke or mini-stroke, Arbelo said.

In addition, many patients need to continue blood thinners and medications that control irregular heartbeats after the procedure, she explained.

During the procedure, a wire is threaded through the blood vessels into the heart and used to burn or freeze small areas of the upper chamber, called the atrium.

The burning or freezing creates a scar and stops abnormal electrical signals that cause the irregular heart rhythm, Arbelo said.

According to Dr. Hugh Calkins, ""Atrial fibrillation ablation is a well-established procedure that has imperfect results."" Calkins is a professor of medicine and director of the cardiac arrhythmia service at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.

The complication rate is higher than hoped, and the success rate is lower than hoped, he said.

""Patients don't get a lifetime certificate saying you're cured,"" Calkins said. ""For one in four patients, atrial fibrillation comes back five years after the procedure. Patients should not be going into this thinking they will have a 99 percent cure rate with no risk,"" he added.

The new study included information from more than 3,600 patients in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. Their average age was 59, and all had undergone catheter ablation.

Ablation was successful in 74 percent of patients, Arbelo said. These patients had no atrial arrhythmias -- irregular heart beats -- for three to 12 months after the procedure.

According to Arbelo, 91 percent of patients choose to have ablation to relieve symptoms, while 66 percent do so to improve their quality of life.

Atrial arrhythmias in the first three months after ablation were classified as early recurrences and not considered as failures, Arbelo said. In addition, 45 percent of patients who had a successful procedure were still taking antiarrhythmia drugs 12 months later.

About 11 percent suffered complications during the year after the ablation, she said.

After the procedure, patients with two or more risk factors for stroke should be prescribed oral blood thinners, while those with no risk factors don't need them, Arbelo suggested.

The study investigators found that 27 percent of patients with two or more risk factors for stroke were not on blood thinners, but one-third of low-risk patients were taking them.

Dr. Gregg Fonarow is a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles. He said, ""Relief of symptoms in patients with atrial fibrillation can be challenging.""

In certain patients, catheter ablation may reduce symptoms, improve quality of life and increase exercise capacity, though the impact on death and hospitalization risk is still being evaluated, he noted.

""Of concern is that complication rates are still higher than desirable for this procedure, and there was suboptimal use of stroke-preventing anticoagulation [anti-clotting] therapy after the procedure,"" added Fonarow, who was not involved with the study.

""Further trials are needed to evaluate the benefits and risks of catheter ablation and its potential role as first-line therapy,"" he suggested.

Catheter ablation is covered by most insurance, including Medicare, the researchers said.

The report was published online recently in the European Heart Journal.

"A small study claims children with autism may benefit from fecal transplants, which involves introducing donated microbes into people with gastrointestinal disease to rebalance the gut. The Ohio State University, Northern Arizona University and Arizona State University researchers found a parallel between behavioral symptoms of autism and gastrointestinal distress, and improvements to both after fecal transplant.

“Transplants are working for people with other gastrointestinal problems,” lead study author Ann Gregory, a microbiology graduate student at The Ohio state University, said in a news release. “And, with autism, gastrointestinal symptoms are often severe, so we thought this could be potentially valuable.

The researchers built off of previous findings that children with autism typically have fewer types of important bacteria in their guts and less bacterial diversity overall. The research team surmises the disparity is due to antibiotics prescribed within the first three years of life.

The study, which was published in the journal Microbiome, included 18 children with autism and moderate to severe gastrointestinal problems. The children ranged from 7 to 16 years old. A questionnaire was used to assess social skills, irritability, hyperactivity and communication. Parents and doctors reported improvements that lasted at least eight weeks after treatment. Children without autism were used as a control for the study, the news release reported.

On average, the score on a scale for ranking gastrointestinal symptoms dropped 82 percent from the beginning to the end of treatment, while average developmental age increased by 1.4 years, according to the release. Researchers also asked the children’s doctors to perform pre- and post-diagnostic evaluations, which suggested lasting benefits.

One of the study’s limitations is its small size, and researchers cautioned that families should not try to replicate the treatment at home.

“We have to be mindful of the placebo effect, and we have to take [the findings] with a grain of salt,” Matthew Sullivan, an associate professor of microbiology at The Ohio State University, said in the release. “But it does give us hope.”"	Fecal transplants may help children with autism, researchers claim	2017-01-25 06:00:00	http://www.foxnews.com/health/2017/01/25/fecal-transplants-may-help-children-with-autism-researchers-claim.html	story_reviews_00295	fake
"(Reuters Health) - Complementary and alternative medicine options may help men manage premature ejaculation, according to a new review of existing research.

The improvements were small, and the studies were of varying quality, but preliminary evidence suggests that acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, Ayurvedic herbal medicine and a Korean topical cream may all have desirable effects, researchers conclude in the journal Sexual Medicine.

“There are a range of treatments available for premature ejaculation, including drug treatments, behavioral techniques and counseling, however, some men may not want to visit the doctor, take drugs long-term or be on a long wait list for counseling,” said lead author Katy Cooper of the University of Sheffield in the UK.

“It’s important to evaluate the evidence for other therapies,” she told Reuters Health by email. “To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to assess complementary and alternative medicine for premature ejaculation.”

According to the International Society for Sexual Medicine, premature ejaculation can be a lifelong problem, and this primary form of the problem is usually defined as ejaculation happening within one minute of initiating vaginal intercourse every time a man has ever had sex. A man’s “latency time” can also become reduced later in his sexual life, and this secondary form is usually defined as ejaculation within three minutes or less.

In the current study, researchers evaluated 10 randomized controlled trials that included comparisons either to another type of treatment or to a placebo, or dummy, treatment. Two studies were of acupuncture, five were of Chinese herbal medicine, one of Ayurvedic herbal medicine and two of Korean topical “severance secret” cream.

Together, the two acupuncture studies found that the treatment slightly increased intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) by about half a minute compared to placebo.

Chinese herbal medicine increased IELT by about two minutes, Ayurvedic herbal medicine increased IELT by nearly a minute and topical cream increased IELT by more than eight minutes.

In some instances, a combination of traditional and alternative options was the most effective. For example, Chinese medicine paired with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) increased IELT by two minutes longer than SSRIs alone and nearly three minutes longer than the Chinese medicine alone.

“There are no approved treatments for premature ejaculation,” said Donald Patrick, vice chair for research at the University of Washington in Seattle. “This is a common condition that has serious psychological effects on relationships,” said Patrick, who wasn’t involved in the study. “We need treatments to address it, and it should be treated with equal seriousness as erectile dysfunction.”

The prevalence of premature ejaculation is difficult to measure because of the differing definitions of the problem and some men’s reluctance to report it. Some studies suggest that between 20 and 30 percent of men report early ejaculation concerns, but the International Society for Sexual Medicine estimates that about 4 percent of men have a lifelong condition.

“Although it is not openly discussed in the media - at least not as much as erectile problems have been discussed in the post-Viagra era - numerous studies report men feel frustrated, depressed and anxious because of this problem,” said Ege Can Serefoglu of the Bagcilar Training and Research Hospital in Istanbul, Turkey.

The main limitation of the study is the underlying weakness of the studies evaluated. Bias was unclear in most of the studies, and only five used stopwatches to measure IELT, which is the “gold standard” for premature ejaculation studies, Patrick said.

In addition, the authors write, the studies are so different, it’s tough to draw conclusions about the different options. For example, the five Chinese medicine studies tested different substances, including Qilin pills, Yimusake and Uighur.

Some studies, but not all, discussed side effects such as gastrointestinal discomfort, dizziness, mild pain and decreased libido. When they were reported, the adverse effects were generally mild, the study team writes.

“Nowadays, I am encountering alternative medicine-obsessed patients more than I used to, and it doesn’t make sense to argue with them about the treatment they want,” Serefoglu told Reuters Health by email. “After all, the placebo is a well-known clinical phenomenon, and some of my patients report surprisingly favorable outcomes.”

"For women who suffer multiple pregnancy losses in the first four to six weeks of gestation, the hormone progesterone could offer hope for a successful birth, according to a new study by Yale School of Medicine researchers and their colleagues at University of Illinois at Chicago.

The results are published in the current issue of Fertility & Sterility, the international journal of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

Fetal death, or intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD), affects 30,000 women each year in the United States. About 25% of all women who become pregnant have a first-trimester loss. But for some women, every pregnancy results in a loss. The researchers studied the effects of micronized plant-derived progesterone in 116 of these women who had experienced two or more pregnancy losses.

To determine whether a woman's endometrium (uterine lining) is healthy and can sustain the embryo, the research team used the endometrial function test (EFT®), which was created by study co-author Harvey J. Kliman, M.D., director of the Reproductive and Placental Research Unit in the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences at Yale School of Medicine. An abnormal EFT is associated with pregnancy failure, while a normal EFT is associated with pregnancy success. Kliman and the team focused on the nCyclinE molecular marker as a way to assess patients with recurrent pregnancy loss.

Women in the study with an abnormal nCyclinE level were prescribed progesterone two days after ovulation, when the uterine lining matures in preparation for a possible pregnancy.

The researchers believe that the progesterone caused the patients' endometrium to produce more endometrial secretions. ""The endometrium feeds the baby up until the eighth week of pregnancy. Then at 9 to 10 weeks the mother's blood takes over to feed the embryo,"" said Kliman.

""In this subset of women experiencing multiple early miscarriages, we assume that their embryos were literally starving to death,"" Kliman added. ""They attached, but they were not getting enough food. When we give progesterone back to these women, the endometrium makes more nutrients and prevents their pregnancy loss.

Kliman said he initially created the Endometrial Function Test (EFT®), which uses the nCyclinE marker, to identify women with infertility. ""This study has shown that the EFT can also be an important tool for patients with recurrent pregnancy loss,"" he said.

Kliman worked with lead author Mary Stephenson, M.D., the Dr. Theresa S. Falcon-Cullinan Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Illinois at Chicago and director of the University of Illinois Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Program.

""We are very pleased to find that these results reinforce the evidence that progesterone could be a very beneficial, inexpensive, and safe treatment for many women with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss,"" said Stephenson. ""The positive results show us that next we need to study progesterone as a treatment for recurrent pregnancy loss with a prospective randomized trial to validate the findings.""

"'There are women who are alive today because of this drug,' says University of Colorado Cancer center researcher

Phase 1 clinical trial data published this week in the journal Clinical Cancer Research show early promise of the investigational anti-cancer agent tucatinib (formerly ONT-380) against HER2+ breast cancer. The 50 women treated had progressed despite a median 5 previous treatment regimens. Twenty-seven percent of these heavily pretreated patients saw clinical benefit from the drug, with at least ""stable disease"" at 24 or more weeks after the start of treatment. These data led to two subsequent Phase Ib studies, resulting in tucatinib earning FDA fast-track status and the expansion of this study once meant only to demonstrate drug safety into the ""pivotal"" trial that will determine approval.

""Usually we expect the results of a phase 1 clinical trial to give us data that we can use to guide the results of future treatments. This is a great case in which, for many of these patients, the results were immediate. There are women who are alive today because of this drug,"" says Virginia Borges, MD, MMSc, director of the Breast Cancer Research Program and Young Women's Breast Cancer Translational Program at the University of Colorado Cancer Center. Borges has been a major driver of the drug's development from its invention at Array Biopharm in Boulder, CO and now through clinical trials of the drug, which is licensed to Cascadian Therapeutics of Seattle, WA.

Tucatinib is a small molecule inhibitor of the HER2 growth factor receptor. The drug works by targeting the HER2 ""tyrosine kinase"" - a link in the chain of communication that allows HER2 receptors to signal the growth of the cell. The fact that it is a small molecule means the drug is able to pass through the blood-brain barrier to act against brain metastases of the disease. HER2+ breast cancer is more likely to affect younger women and also more likely than other breast cancers to metastasize specifically to the brain.

Working with Borges's Young Women's Breast Cancer Translational Program at CU Cancer Center, young investigator Elena Shagisultanova, MD, PhD, recently earned a $1.4m competitive ASPIRE grant from Pfizer, Inc., to conduct a clinical trial exploring the use of tucatinib against so-called ""triple positive"" breast cancer - those cancers driven by both estrogen and progesterone receptors and the HER2/neu oncogene.

""When both [estrogen and HER2] are positive, they counteract the therapy aimed at one or the other, playing off each other like kids splitting parents,"" Borges says. More specifically, when both avenues are present, the crosstalk leads to tumors being resistant to treatment, as either avenue can allow the cancer to survive therapy. Previous trials concurrently targeting estrogen and HER2 have been, according to Borges, ""lackluster,"" resulting in no changes to the standard of care.

The forthcoming trial lead by Shagisultanova will be a multi-center clinical trial with CU Cancer Center as the lead site, testing the combination of three drugs - tucatinib plus the anti-estrogen receptor drug letrozole and the cell cycle inhibitor palbociclib - against breast cancers positive for both HER2 and estrogen receptors.

""Tucatinib could be a substantially practice-changing drug,"" Borges says, meaning that in addition to the drug's current investigations as a third-, fourth-, or more-than-fifth-line treatment, she envisions its use sooner in the arc of breast cancer treatment and with far more patients.

""I think this drug has an extremely high likelihood of being approved for women with HER2+ breast cancer for use after previous treatments,"" Borges says. ""And it's going to be an especially important drug due to its ability to control brain metastases. The opportunity to study it as a front-line drug for recurrent triple positive breast cancer could even someday help us prevent or delay these brain metastases.""

Because the drug is taken in pill form and has a very favorable side effect profile, Borges points out that it is relatively patient-friendly, allowing women to avoid treatments in infusion centers and also many of the side-effects associated with chemotherapies.

Ongoing updates are expected in journals and meetings later in 2017.

"A new method of stimulating the renewal of living stem cells in tooth pulp using an Alzheimer's drug has been discovered by a team of researchers at King's College London.

Following trauma or an infection, the inner, soft pulp of a tooth can become exposed and infected. In order to protect the tooth from infection, a thin band of dentine is naturally produced and this seals the tooth pulp, but it is insufficient to effectively repair large cavities.

Currently dentists use man-made cements or fillings, such as calcium and silicon-based products, to treat these larger cavities and fill holes in teeth. This cement remains in the tooth and fails to disintegrate, meaning that the normal mineral level of the tooth is never completely restored.

However, in a paper published today in Scientific Reports, scientists from the Dental Institute at King's College London have proven a way to stimulate the stem cells contained in the pulp of the tooth and generate new dentine - the mineralised material that protects the tooth - in large cavities, potentially reducing the need for fillings or cements.

The novel, biological approach could see teeth use their natural ability to repair large cavities rather than using cements or fillings, which are prone to infections and often need replacing a number of times. Indeed when fillings fail or infection occurs, dentists have to remove and fill an area that is larger than what is affected, and after multiple treatments the tooth may eventually need to be extracted.

As this new method encourages natural tooth repair, it could eliminate all of these issues, providing a more natural solution for patients.

Significantly, one of the small molecules used by the team to stimulate the renewal of the stem cells included Tideglusib, which has previously been used in clinical trials to treat neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease. This presents a real opportunity to fast-track the treatment into practice.

Using biodegradable collagen sponges to deliver the treatment, the team applied low doses of small molecule glycogen synthase kinase (GSK-3) to the tooth. They found that the sponge degraded over time and that new dentine replaced it, leading to complete, natural repair. Collagen sponges are commercially-available and clinically-approved, again adding to the potential of the treatment's swift pick-up and use in dental clinics.

Lead author of the study, Professor Paul Sharpe from King's College London said: ""The simplicity of our approach makes it ideal as a clinical dental product for the natural treatment of large cavities, by providing both pulp protection and restoring dentine.

""In addition, using a drug that has already been tested in clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease provides a real opportunity to get this dental treatment quickly into clinics.""

"Amsterdam, The Netherlands: A test that measures the levels of five chemicals in the breath has shown promising results for the detection of cancers of the oesophagus and stomach in a large patient trial presented at the European Cancer Congress 2017 [1].

Together, stomach and oesophageal cancer account for around 1.4 million new cancer diagnoses each year worldwide [2]. Both tend to be diagnosed late, because the symptoms are ambiguous, meaning the five-year survival rate for these two types of cancer is only 15%.

The new research, involving more than 300 patients, showed that the test could diagnose cancer with an overall accuracy of 85%.

Dr Sheraz Markar, an NIHR Clinical Trials Fellow from Imperial College London, under the supervision of Professor George Hanna, told the Congress: ""At present the only way to diagnose oesophageal cancer or stomach cancer is with endoscopy. This method is expensive, invasive and has some risk of complications.

""A breath test could be used as a non-invasive, first-line test to reduce the number of unnecessary endoscopies. In the longer term this could also mean earlier diagnosis and treatment, and better survival.""

The trial was based on the results of previous research that suggested differences in the levels of specific chemicals (butyric, pentanoic and hexanoic acids, butanal, and decanal) between patients with stomach or oesophageal cancer and patients with upper gastrointestinal symptoms without cancer. The new research aimed to test whether this 'chemical signature' that seemed to typify cancer could be the basis of a diagnostic test.

In the new study, the research team collected breath samples from 335 people at St Mary's Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust; University College London Hospital; and the Royal Marsden Hospital, London. Of these, 163 had been diagnosed with stomach or oesophageal cancer and 172 showed no evidence of cancer when they had an endoscopy.

All the samples were analysed with a technique called selected ion flow-tube mass spectrometry, which is able to accurately measure small amounts of different chemicals in mixtures of gases such as breath.

Researchers measured the levels of the five chemicals in each sample to see which ones matched to the 'chemical signature' that indicated cancer.

The results showed that the test was 85% accurate overall, with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 81%. This means that not only was the breath test good at picking up those who had cancer (sensitivity), it was also good at correctly identifying who did not have cancer (specificity).

Dr Markar said: ""Because cancer cells are different to healthy ones, they produce a different mixture of chemicals. This study suggests that we may be able detect these differences and use a breath test to indicate which patients are likely to have cancer of the oesophagus and stomach, and which do not. However, these findings must be validated in a larger sample of patients before the test could be used in the clinic.""

Over the next three years, the researchers will continue with a larger trial, using the test with patients who are being given an endoscopy for gastrointestinal symptoms but not yet diagnosed with cancer. This will assess the ability of the test to pick up cases within a group that is likely to contain only a small percentage of cancers.

The team is also working on breath tests for other types of cancer, such as colorectal and pancreatic, which could be used as first-line tests in general practice surgeries.

"COLUMBUS, Ohio - Anti-inflammatory diets -- which tend to be high in vegetables, fruits, fish and whole grains -- could boost bone health and prevent fractures in some women, a new study suggests.

Researchers examined data from the landmark Women's Health Initiative to compare levels of inflammatory elements in the diet to bone mineral density and fractures and found new associations between food and bone health. The study, led by Tonya Orchard, an assistant professor of human nutrition at The Ohio State University, appears in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research.

Women with the least-inflammatory diets (based on a scoring system called the Dietary Inflammatory Index) lost less bone density during the six-year follow-up period than their peers with the most-inflammatory diets. This was despite the fact that they started off with lower bone density overall.

Furthermore, diets with low inflammatory potential appeared to correspond to lower risk of hip fracture among one subgroup of the study -- post-menopausal white women younger than 63.

The findings suggest that women's bone health could benefit when they choose a diet higher in beneficial fats, plants and whole grains, said Orchard, who is part of Ohio State's Food Innovation Center.

""This suggests that as women age, healthy diets are impacting their bones,"" Orchard said. ""I think this gives us yet another reason to support the recommendations for a healthy diet in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.""

Because the study was observational, it's not possible to definitively link dietary patterns and bone health and fracture outcomes.

Rebecca Jackson, the study's senior author and director of Ohio State's Center for Clinical and Translational Science, said the new findings support a growing body of evidence that factors that increase inflammation can increase osteoporosis risk.

""By looking at the full diet rather than individual nutrients, these data provide a foundation for studying how components of the diet might interact to provide benefit and better inform women's health and lifestyle choices,"" said Jackson, who is national chair of the Women's Health Initiative steering committee.

Previous studies have connected high levels of inflammatory markers in the blood to bone loss and to fractures in older women and men, which prompted Orchard and her colleagues to wonder what they'd find if they took one more step back - to the dietary choices that contribute to inflammation in the body.

The Dietary Inflammatory Index - developed to assess the quality of diet from maximally to minimally inflammatory based on nutrients consumed - helped them accomplish that. Dietary information as well as data on bone density and fracture were collected from a large group of the participants in the Women's Health Initiative, the largest study of postmenopausal women's health undertaken in U.S. history.

Participants in the WHI were 50 to 79 when they enrolled in the study of prevention and control of common diseases impacting older women. Enrollment ran from 1993 to 1998.

For the new analysis - the first of its kind - the research team looked at dietary data from 160,191 women and assigned inflammation scores based on 32 food components that the women reported consuming in the three months prior to their enrollment.

The researchers used bone-mineral-density data from a subset of 10,290 women. Fracture data was collected for the entire study group.

Orchard and her colleagues found a correlation only between high-inflammatory diets and fracture in younger white women in the study. Higher scores were associated with an almost 50 percent larger risk of hip fracture in Caucasian women younger than 63, compared with the risk for women in the group with the lowest inflammatory scores.

""This suggests that a high-quality, less-inflammatory diet may be especially important in reducing hip fracture risk in younger women,"" the researchers wrote.

But in the study group overall, more-inflammatory diets were not linked to fracture and - in fact - the researchers found a modestly lower risk of lower-arm and total fracture in women with the highest dietary inflammation scores. One possible explanation included in the study: The women with lower inflammation scores were more physically active as a group and therefore were at a slightly greater risk of falls.

Women with the least-inflammatory diets had lower bone mineral density overall at the start of the study, but lost less bone than their high-inflammation peers, the researchers found. The lower bone density to start could be because women with healthier diets are more likely to be of a smaller build, Orchard said. Larger people have higher bone density to support their larger frames.

""These women with healthier diets didn't lose bone as quickly as those with high-inflammation diets, and this is important because after menopause women see a drastic loss in bone density that contributes to fractures,"" Orchard said.

"Oakland, CA (January 3, 2017) - A new study by researchers from the UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute (CHORI) shows that a modest 4 milligrams of extra zinc a day in the diet can have a profound, positive impact on cellular health that helps fight infections and diseases. This amount of zinc is equivalent to what biofortified crops like zinc rice and zinc wheat can add to the diet of vulnerable, nutrient deficient populations.

The study, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, was led by CHORI Senior Scientist Janet King, PhD. King and her team are the first to show that a modest increase in dietary zinc reduces oxidative stress and damage to DNA.

""We were pleasantly surprised to see that just a small increase in dietary zinc can have such a significant impact on how metabolism is carried out throughout the body,"" says King. ""These results present a new strategy for measuring the impact of zinc on health and reinforce the evidence that food-based interventions can improve micronutrient deficiencies worldwide.""

Zinc is ubiquitous in our body and facilitates many functions that are essential for preserving life. It plays a vital role in maintaining optimal childhood growth, and in ensuring a healthy immune system. Zinc also helps limit inflammation and oxidative stress in our body, which are associated with the onset of chronic cardiovascular diseases and cancers.

Around much of the world, many households eat polished white rice or highly refined wheat or maize flours, which provide energy but do not provide enough essential micronutrients such as zinc. Zinc is an essential part of nearly 3,000 different proteins, and it impacts how these proteins regulate every cell in our body. In the absence of sufficient zinc, our ability to repair everyday wear and tear on our DNA is compromised.

In the randomized, controlled, six-week study the scientists measured the impact of zinc on human metabolism by counting DNA strand breaks. They used the parameter of DNA damage to examine the influence of a moderate amount of zinc on healthy living. This was a novel approach, different from the commonly used method of looking at zinc in the blood or using stunting and morbidity for assessing zinc status.

According to King, these results are relevant to the planning and evaluation of food-based solutions for mitigating the impact of hidden hunger and malnutrition. King believes that biofortification can be a sustainable, long-term solution to zinc deficiency.

"CHICAGO (January 26, 2017): Patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease, known as GERD, who undergo laparoscopic anti-reflux operations compared with traditional ""open"" operations suffer fewer postoperative complications, experience faster recovery, and incur lower health care costs, according to study results published online as an ""article in press"" on the Journal of the American College of Surgeons website, ahead of print publication.



GERD affects nearly 20 percent of American adults, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.* Heartburn, a burning sensation in the chest, is a common symptom of GERD.



""Patients with GERD have an incompetent lower esophageal sphincter, which allows gastric acid to go back up into the esophagus,"" said lead study author Francisco Schlottmann, MD, a surgeon at the Center for Esophageal Diseases and Swallowing, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. ""Anti-reflux surgery should be considered in patients who do not achieve complete control of their symptoms [regurgitation or cough] with medications; who do not want to take medications for the rest of their lives; or who experience complications of medical therapy.""



For the study, researchers analyzed data in the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database of more than 75,000 adults who underwent either laparoscopic or open fundoplication for GERD between 2000 and 2013. NIS represents 1,000 U.S. hospitals and contains data on more than seven million hospitalizations each year. During the study period, 58.4 percent of patients underwent laparoscopic procedures and 41.6 percent had open anti-reflux operations performed through a long abdominal incision.



The study showed that the rate of laparoscopic procedures increased from 24.8 percent in 2000 to 84.3 percent in 2013. ""Surprisingly, in 2003, 12 years after the first laparoscopic anti-reflux operation was reported, only 25 percent of all the anti-reflux operations were performed laparoscopically in the U.S.,"" Dr. Schlottmann said. ""Subsequently, the rate increased, but 15 percent of all anti-reflux operations were still being performed through an open approach in 2013. We believe this percentage is very high, and we hope that in the next year this percentage will decrease.""



Along with discovering that the use of laparoscopy for the surgical treatment of GERD has increased significantly in the last decade, the researchers also found that, on average, the minimally invasive approach reduced length of hospital stay by approximately two days, and open operations were more than $9,000 more expensive than minimally invasive procedures.



The researchers also found that laparoscopic procedures were better for patients in terms of fewer complications. Laparoscopic anti-reflux operations were less likely to result in postoperative blood clots, wound complications, surgical site infection, esophageal perforation (which can be life threatening), bleeding, cardiac failure, and death.



""Our study highlights the fact that laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery is as effective as the open approach, and in 2017, with all its advantages, should be the standard of care,"" said senior study author Marco G. Patti, MD, FACS, a surgeon and Director of the Center for Esophageal Diseases and Swallowing, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.



""We found that laparoscopic surgery is associated with significantly lower costs. In addition, indirect costs of the open approach, including an impaired ability to work, time off from work, and intangible costs of postoperative pain and healing, are difficult to measure but also favor the laparoscopic approach,"" said Dr. Patti.



""GERD is a common digestive disorder that can usually be treated with dietary changes and medications such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). However, chronic and not-controlled GERD can cause serious complications. Repeated exposure to stomach acid can damage the lining of the esophagus and lead to a precancerous condition called Barrett's esophagus,"" said Dr. Schlottmann.



Study results also revealed that urban academic or teaching hospitals performed laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery at a higher rate than open procedures, 54.4 percent versus 45.6 percent. ""We think that it is important to make this information more available to the public. In order to achieve good outcomes, anti-reflux surgery should be performed laparoscopically in specialized centers,"" said Dr. Patti.

"ATLANTA--Administering chemotherapy to African-American breast cancer patients prior to surgery could improve their prognosis and survival rates from the disease, according to a new study.

A research team led by Georgia State University found African-American breast cancer patients who receive chemotherapy prior to surgery exhibit trends of reduced regional (in lymph nodes) recurrence and distant (in remote organs, such as the liver, lungs and brain) recurrence of tumors, which may help diminish the inequality in breast cancer-related clinical outcomes between African-American and European-American patients.

There is a significant disparity in breast cancer mortality between African-American and European-American breast cancer patients. Despite a similar number of reported cases of breast cancer among African-American and European-American women, African-Americans experience a more aggressive clinical course and a 40 percent higher death rate than European-Americans among premenopausal and menopausal breast cancer patients.

Recurrent breast cancer has hindered the successful management of this disease for decades and is one of the primary factors for the racial disparity in prognosis and outcomes. Differences in recurrence rates and patterns between the races following various forms of treatment have not been thoroughly investigated.

This is the first clinical study to suggest that neoadjuvant chemotherapy (treatment prior to surgery) may improve breast cancer recurrence rates and patterns in African-Americans. The results are published in the journal PLOS ONE.

Researchers at Georgia State analyzed clinical data from a large cohort of breast cancer patients treated at Northside Hospital in Atlanta from 2005 to 2015. The patients' self-reported races were primarily African-American and European-American. The researchers studied rates and patterns of tumor recurrence after hormone, radiation and chemotherapy among African-American and European-American breast cancer patients.

""We found that, in general, African-American breast cancer patients exhibit increased likelihood for tumor recurrence, particularly to regional and distant sites, after receiving any combination of adjuvant therapy (treatment following surgery) compared to European-American breast cancer patients. This higher incidence of tumor recurrence can contribute to a poorer prognosis,"" said Nikita Wright, first author of the study and a senior Ph.D. student in Dr. Ritu Aneja's laboratory in Georgia State's Biology Department.

When breast cancer recurs, it is more challenging to treat regional and distant tumors than local tumors (in the breast), Wright explained.

""Interestingly, we found that neoadjuvant chemotherapy actually reversed these recurrence trends,"" Wright said. ""We found that African-American breast cancer patients responded better to neoadjuvant chemotherapy than European-American patients. Among patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, African-Americans exhibited trends of lower regional and distant tumor recurrence than European-Americans, but higher local recurrence, which is easier to manage clinically and is associated with a relatively better prognosis.""

The researchers also found that among early stage patients (noninvasive or minimally invasive breast cancer), African-Americans displayed higher tumor recurrence than European-American patients.

Breast cancer prognosis of African-American patients may improve with chemotherapy before surgery	2017-01-29 06:00:00	https://web.archive.org/web/20170129125717/https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-01/gsu-bcp011917.php	news_reviews_00295	true
"Using data from a national study, Johns Hopkins researchers determined that using heart CT scans can help personalize treatment in patients whose blood pressure falls in the gray zone of just above normal or mild high blood pressure. Previously, the appropriate blood pressure treatment for these patients used risk calculations and some guesswork, potentially leaving many vulnerable to heart disease or taking drugs they don't need. Nearly one in three adults in the U.S. has prehypertension, blood pressure higher than normal but not considered high yet.

The scans detect levels of calcium in the heart's arteries, and the physicians suggest those people with the highest calcium levels would benefit most from aggressive blood pressure treatment, whereas those with little or no calcium may not need to be treated as intensively, depending on their other heart disease risk factors.

In the study, published on Jan. 10 in Circulation, the researchers say these calcium scores allow physicians to go beyond the traditionally calculated risk factors to determine which blood pressure treatment strategy may be most appropriate for a particular patient.

""If a health care provider wants to target blood pressure in a patient with traditional heart disease risk factors and above-normal blood pressure, he or she can look at coronary artery calcium to help with tiebreakerlike decisions,"" says J. William McEvoy, M.B.B.Ch., M.H.S., assistant professor of medicine and member of the Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ""Our study, along with others, such as SPRINT and HOPE, positions cardiac risk and coronary artery calcium as helpful ways to determine if a given patient would either benefit from more intensive blood pressure control or do just fine with a more traditional blood pressure target.""

In late 2015, the SPRINT trial showed improved outcomes for participants with increased risk for heart disease whose physicians targeted their systolic (the top number) blood pressures to 120 millimeters of mercury, rather than the traditional 140 millimeters of mercury. But not all people deemed ""higher risk"" by traditional methods may need to be aggressively treated, McEvoy says. Some people react poorly to higher doses of blood pressure medicines and experience side effects, such as sexual dysfunction, dizziness, falls, weakness and more. And the risk factor equations that determine whether certain people are at higher risk and should be treated more intensively with blood pressure medications may have inaccuracies on the individual level, says McEvoy. ""We can predict that about 15 out of every 100 people with a particular risk score will die of a heart attack, but the equations don't tell us which of those people will be one of the actual 15; they don't give us personalized information,"" says McEvoy.

Conventionally, coronary artery calcium scores have informed physicians' decisions of whether to put a patient on statins, but the researchers say they haven't been evaluated before for their potential ability to determine blood pressure treatment. To determine if coronary artery calcium scores could inform blood pressure recommendations too, the researchers used data from 3,733 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) who had systolic blood pressures between 120 and 179 millimeters of mercury. Participants were an average of 65 years old, and 48 percent were men. Thirty-five percent were white, 32 percent were African-American, 22 percent were Hispanic and 11 percent were Chinese-American. At the beginning of the study, investigators measured their blood pressure and performed a cardiac CT scan to determine coronary artery calcium scores. They also calculated each participant's heart disease risk with the Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Algorithm, which uses traditional risk factors, such as race, age, sex, cholesterol levels and family history of disease. About once a year for 10 years, an interviewer contacted each participant or a family member to determine heart disease diagnosis, hospitalizations or deaths. After about 10 years, the participants had 642 heart disease events, such as heart attack, heart failure, stroke and death.

The researchers divided the participants by their coronary artery calcium scores into one of three groups: those with a score of zero, those with a score of one to 100 and those with a score greater than 100. Then, they looked at the number of heart disease-related events in each calcium score category broken down by blood pressure range and calculated heart disease risk. Low heart disease risk was classified as a less than 15 percent chance of a heart disease event over the next 10 years, and high risk was 15 percent or greater risk of a heart disease event. To get the event rate, the investigators divided the number of events in each category by the amount of people in the study multiplied by the length of time they spent in the study, known as a person-year.

Participants with calcium scores of zero with a high calculated risk of heart disease had a relatively low actual event rate after the 10-year study. For example, according to the researchers, those with systolic blood pressures below 140 millimeters of mercury and no calcium had an event rate of 12.7 events per 1,000 person-years, and similar people with systolic blood pressures between 140 and 159 millimeters of mercury had an event rate of 13.6 events per 1,000 person-years.

In contrast, participants with systolic blood pressure under 140 millimeters of mercury -- below the current cutoff for treatment -- and rated with a low predicted risk of heart disease who had a calcium score over 100 had a high actual event rate of 19.7 events per 1,000 person-years. Thus, even though their calculated heart disease risk is relatively low and their blood pressure is below traditional cutoffs for treatment, the researchers say people in this category with calcium over 100 are high risk and may benefit from more aggressive blood pressure treatment.

Participants with high systolic blood pressure between 160 and 179 millimeters of mercury had high event rates ranging from 20 to 40 heart disease events per 1,000 person-years regardless of their calcium scores. The researchers say this demonstrates that calcium scores may only be useful in guiding more personalized blood pressure treatment for patients with mild high blood pressure -- the gray zone -- not those with high blood pressure.

""It may be that if patients are in that blood pressure treatment gray zone with a high risk score but their coronary artery calcium score is zero, then they don't need to be treated aggressively to 120 millimeters of mercury and can be treated to 140 instead,"" says McEvoy. ""But if patients have a high calcium score and are in the gray zone, then it would make sense to go with 120 as a treatment goal.""

The researchers caution that results are from an observational study, and a randomized trial would be needed to confirm the recommendations.

Coronary artery calcium scans aren't usually covered by insurance and can range in cost from $100 to $400. The scans use radiation, so there is a very small cancer risk for susceptible individuals.

About 70 million adults in the U.S. have high blood pressure -- a systolic blood pressure over 140 millimeters of mercury -- putting them at increased risk for heart attacks, stroke, heart failure and kidney disease, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

"A new pilot study led by McLean Hospital's Ipsit Vahia, MD, medical director of Geriatric Psychiatry Outpatient Services at McLean Hospital, suggests that the use of tablet computers is both a safe and a potentially effective approach to managing agitation among patients with dementia.

""Tablet use as a nonpharmacologic intervention for agitation in older adults, including those with severe dementia, appears to be feasible, safe, and of potential utility,"" said Vahia. ""Our preliminary results are a first step in developing much-needed empirical data for clinicians and caregivers on how to use technology such as tablets as tools to enhance care and also for app developers working to serve the technologic needs of this population.""

""Use of Tablet Devices in the Management of Agitation Among Inpatients with Dementia: An Open Label Study"" was recently published in the online version of The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry. This research builds upon previous studies demonstrating that art, music, and other similar therapies can effectively reduce symptoms of dementia without medication. By using tablet devices to employ these therapies, however, patients and providers also benefit from a computer's inherent flexibility.

""The biggest advantage is versatility,"" said Vahia. ""We know that art therapy can work, music therapy can work. The tablet, however, gives you the option of switching from one app to another easily, modifying the therapy seamlessly to suit the individual. You don't need to invest in new equipment or infrastructure.""

Researchers loaded a menu of 70 apps onto the tablets for the study. The apps were freely available on iTunes and varied greatly in their cognitive complexity--from an app that displayed puppy photos to one that featured Sudoku puzzles.

The researchers found that tablet use was safe for every patient, regardless of the severity of their dementia, and that with proper supervision and training, the engagement rate with the devices was nearly 100 percent. The study also found that the tablets demonstrated significant effectiveness in reducing symptoms of agitation, particularly--but not exclusively--among patients with milder forms of dementia.

Vahia cited several examples of the tablet's potential to improve a patient's condition. One particular patient, who only spoke Romanian, was very withdrawn and irritable, and medications were ineffective in controlling his symptoms.

""We started showing him Romanian video clips on YouTube, and his behavior changed dramatically and instantaneously,"" said Vahia. ""His mood improved. He became more interactive. He and his medical support team also started using a translation app so that staff could ask him simple questions in Romanian, facilitating increased interaction. These significant improvements are a clear testament of the tablet's potential as a clinical tool.""

Based on such promising outcomes, the Geriatric Psychiatry Outpatient Services clinical team is expanding the use of tablet devices as a means to control agitation in dementia patients at McLean. This will allow researchers to develop more robust data and expand the scope of the study, including a focus on specific clinical factors that may impact how patients with dementia engage with and respond to apps.

"For concussion sufferers, even those who never lost consciousness, physicians may now be able to predict early on who is more likely to continue experiencing symptoms months or years after the head-jarring event, using a new non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method devised by a consortium of researchers led by UC San Francisco scientists.

In their new study, published online January 13, 2017 in the Journal of Neurotrauma, the researchers used a technique called functional MRI (fMRI), coupled with sophisticated statistical analysis, to track activity in the brain networks of 75 patients, aged 18 to 55, within the first two weeks of their having experienced concussions.

The study revealed telltale patterns of brain activity that, six months later, were associated with worse performance on behavioral and cognitive tests and were different from patterns seen in healthy control subjects.

The fMRI method and analysis developed for the study highlighted abnormal patterns of brain activity that pointed to a higher risk for long-term, post-concussive symptoms, even among the 44 study participants who had no evidence of bleeding or bruising in the brain in the immediate aftermath of brain trauma on computed tomography (CT) or ordinary MRI scans.

""This is an exploratory, proof-of-concept study showing that we can identify patients soon after mild brain trauma who may have more persistent symptoms, despite no other evidence of injury within the brain,"" said Pratik Mukherjee, MD, PhD, professor of radiology and biomedical imaging at UCSF and the senior author of the study. ""We may be able to use this information to help guide treatment decisions and counseling of patients early on, when it may be more effective.""

Only subjects who had lost consciousness for less than 30 minutes were eligible for the study, and many study subjects never lost consciousness during their injury.

Scientists refer to concussion as mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), but for some patients the harmful, sometimes insidious effects are long lasting. Common symptoms in the aftermath of concussion include confusion, headache, changes in vision or hearing, thinking or memory problems, fatigue, sleep changes and mood changes. Previously there has not been a way to predict whose symptoms will fade or persist following mTBI.

Although effective drug treatments for mTBI await discovery, rest and counseling are known to be helpful for patients, Mukherjee said.

In the new study, the researchers focused on well-known networks of activity that are observed when the brain is in a resting state. ""We asked subjects to close their eyes, to relax, and to not focus their attention on anything specific -- but also to not fall asleep,"" Mukherjee said.

In comparison to the control subjects, who had never experienced TBI, mTBI patients displayed less connectivity in frontal areas of the ""default mode network,"" a set of brain regions that are particularly active in the resting brain. They also exhibited less connectivity within several other networks, including those known as the executive control network, the fronto-parietal network, the dorsal attentional network, and the orbitofrontal network; they showed an increase in connectivity in the visual network. Several of these differences were associated with worse performance months later in cognitive and behavioral tests.

"TAMPA, Fla. (Jan. 3, 2016) - Deregulation and inhibition of the immune system contributes to cancer development. Many therapeutic strategies aim to re-stimulate the immune system to recognize cancer cells and target them for destruction. Researchers from Moffitt Cancer Center report that a dendritic cell vaccine that targets the HER2 protein on breast cancer cells is safe and effectively stimulates the immune system leading to regression of early-stage breast cancer.

The HER2 protein is overexpressed in 20-25% of all breast cancer tumors and is associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis. Researchers have previously shown that immune cells are less able to recognize and target cancer cells that express HER2 as breast cancer progresses into a more advanced and invasive stage. This suggests that strategies that can restimulate the immune system to recognize and target HER2 early during cancer development may be effective treatment options.

The researchers previously developed a vaccine that helps the immune system recognize the HER2 protein on breast cancer cells. Their approach involves creating the vaccine from immune cells called dendritic cells that are harvested from each individual patient to create a personalized vaccine.

In order to determine if the HER2-dendritic cell vaccine is safe and effective, the researchers performed a clinical trial in 54 women who have HER2-expressing early-stage breast cancer. The dendritic cell vaccines were prepared by isolating dendritic cells from each patients' blood and exposing them to fragments of the HER2 protein. Patients were injected with a dose of their personal dendritic cell vaccine once a week for 6 weeks into either a lymph node, the breast tumor, or into both sites.

The researchers report that the dendritic cell vaccines were well-tolerated and patients only experienced low-grade toxicities. The most common adverse events were fatigue, injection site reactions, and chills. They also show that the vaccine was able to stimulate an immune response in the majority of the patients. Approximately 80% of evaluable patients had a detectable immune response in their peripheral blood and/or in their sentinel lymph node wherein their cancer is most likely to spread to first. Importantly, the immune responses among the patients were similar, regardless of the route of vaccine administration.

The Moffitt researchers assessed the effectiveness of the vaccine by determining the percentage of patients who had detectable disease within surgical specimens after resection. The absence of disease is termed a pathological complete response (pCR). They report that 13 patients achieved a pCR and patients who had early non-invasive disease called ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) achieved a higher rate of pCR than patients who had early-stage invasive disease. Interestingly, patients who achieved a pCR had a higher immune response within their local sentinel lymph nodes.

""These results suggest that vaccines are more effective in DCIS, thereby warranting further evaluation in DCIS or other minimal disease settings, and the local regional sentinel lymph node may serve as a more meaningful immunologic endpoint,"" said Brian J. Czerniecki, MD, PhD, Chair of the Department of Breast Oncology at Moffitt Cancer Center.

"EPA and DHA omega-3s reduce the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), according to results of a new, comprehensive meta-analysis published in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings. Among randomized controlled trials (RCTs), there was a statistically significant reduction in CHD risk in higher risk populations, including:

16 percent in those with high triglycerides and 14 percent in those with high LDL cholesterol.

A non-statistically significant 6 percent risk reduction among all populations in RCTs, a finding supported by a statistically significant 18 percent reduced risk of CHD among prospective cohort studies.

""What makes this paper unique is that it looked at the effects of EPA and DHA on coronary heart disease specifically, which is an important nuance considering coronary heart disease accounts for half of all cardiovascular deaths in the U.S.,"" said Dr. Dominik Alexander, lead author and Principal Epidemiologist for EpidStat. ""The 6 percent reduced risk among RCTs, coupled with an 18 percent risk reduction in prospective cohort studies -- which tend to include more real-life dietary scenarios over longer periods -- tell a compelling story about the importance of EPA and DHA omega-3s for cardiovascular health.""

Additional study details include:

The study reviewed 18 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 16 prospective cohort studies, with 93,000 and 732,000 subjects, respectively.

The study examined outcomes such as myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death and coronary death.

The study compared the results of RCTs, which explore interventions under strict clinical conditions, to those of prospective cohort studies that are observational, and followed larger populations for longer periods of time.

""There are important public health implications related to reducing the risk of coronary heart disease, and therefore we are encouraged by the results of this comprehensive analysis,"" said Dr. Harry Rice, Vice President of Regulatory and Scientific Affairs for the Global Organization for EPA and DHA Omega-3s (GOED), which funded the study. ""It's also important that the observed risk reductions were even stronger in patient populations with elevated triglycerides and LDL cholesterol levels, two risk factors that affect more than one quarter of the American population.""

""The results confirm that increasing omega-3s is a healthy lifestyle intervention that can contribute towards reductions in CHD risk,"" added Adam Ismail, Executive Director of GOED. ""Remember that increasing omega-3 intakes is basically just improving the quality of one's diet slightly, like reducing the amount of sodium or increasing your dietary fiber. It is a simple, inexpensive, and achievable change that most consumers need to make to optimize their health.""

An accompanying editorial in Mayo Clinic Proceedings also acknowledges the importance of the study. ""The meta-analyses of Alexander and colleagues suggests that omega-3 fatty acid intake may reduce risk of adverse CHD events, especially among people with elevated levels of TGs or LDL-C....omega-3 fatty acid intake of at least 1 gram of EPA+DHA per day, either from seafood or supplementation (as recommended by the American Heart Association), continues to be a reasonable strategy,"" said the authors.

Study authors did point out that further clinical trials looking specifically at CHD outcomes may continue to provide a better understanding of the promising beneficial relationship between EPA/DHA and CHD risk. Current RCTs have varying durations, different baseline CHD status for study participants, and utilize several methods for patient selection and randomization. Future studies should:

Increase patient populations to account for dropout rates in longer trials.

Extensively detail how subjects are diagnosed to create uniform diagnostic criteria.

Be appropriately powered to detect an effect in current clinical conditions.

"(New York, NY - January 18, 2017) An international phase 3 trial has found that the drug regorafenib improved survival in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a form of liver cancer, giving people who previously had no other options a better chance at survival. Results from the study, which included researchers at The Tisch Cancer Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, were recently published online in The Lancet. The trial, funded by Bayer, included 152 sites in 21 countries.

About 40 percent of HCC cases are diagnosed at advanced stages, a point when HCC is particularly difficult to treat. This trial provides evidence that regorafenib is the first systemic treatment for patients whose HCC progressed during treatment with sorafenib, the only other drug with proven clinical benefit.

This study tested regorafenib's effectiveness as a second-line therapy on 573 patients previously treated with sorafenib, 194 of whom were given a placebo. Regorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, significantly improved overall survival, from 7.8 months on placebo to 10.6 months with regorafenib. Two patients treated with regorafenib had their tumor shrink to an undetectable level, according to the study.

""This study represents a breakthrough in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma, since it provides evidence for clinical benefits in an area that was an unmet medical need,"" said Josep M. Llovet, MD, founder and Director of the Liver Cancer Program and Professor of Medicine and Liver Diseases at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. ""Regorafenib has shown it can improve survival in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma progressing on sorafenib. Previously, no treatment was available for these patients.""

Dr. Llovet was a member of the clinical trial's steering committee, and Charissa Chang, MD, Assistant Professor of Medicine and Liver Diseases at the Icahn School of Medicine, was principal investigator of the Mount Sinai testing site.

The success of this trial opens the field for testing drugs in third-line treatment of HCC and provides a rationale to test regorafenib as a first-line treatment or in combination with therapies administered directly into the tumor or diseased liver in patients in an earlier stage of HCC, according to Dr. Llovet. In this trial, regorafenib was well-tolerated with manageable adverse events, according to the paper in Lancet.

In January, Bayer announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had granted priority review status for Stivarga (regorafenib) as a second-line systemic treatment for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. This research was also presented during the European Society of Medical Oncology's World Congress on Gastrointestinal Cancer in June.

Liver cancer is the second-leading primary cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.

"CHICAGO --- Soon you can seek mental health advice on your smartphone as quickly as finding a good restaurant.

A novel suite of 13 speedy mini-apps called IntelliCare resulted in participants reporting significantly less depression and anxiety by using the apps on their smartphones up to four times a day, reports a new Northwestern Medicine study.

The apps offer exercises to de-stress, reduce self-criticism and worrying, methods to help your life feel more meaningful, mantras to highlight your strengths, strategies for a good night's sleep and more.

Most apps designed for mental health typically offer a single strategy to feel better or provide too many features that make them difficult to navigate. Users may get bored or overwhelmed and may stop using the apps after a few weeks.

But participants robustly used the IntelliCare interactive apps as many as four times daily -- or an average of 195 times -- for eight weeks of the study. They spent an average of one minute using each app, with longer times for apps with relaxation videos.

The 96 participants who completed the research study reported that they experienced about a 50 percent decrease in the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms. The short-term study-related reductions are comparable to results expected in clinical practice using psychotherapy or with that seen using antidepressant medication.

The study will be published Jan. 5 in the Journal of Medical Internet Research.

""We designed these apps so they fit easily into people's lives and could be used as simply as apps to find a restaurant or directions,"" said lead study author David Mohr, professor of preventive medicine and director of the Center for Behavioral Intervention Technologies at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.

""Some of the participants kept using them after the study because they felt that the apps helped them feel better,"" Mohr said. ""There were many apps to try during the study, so there was a sense of novelty.""

Participants had access to the 13 IntelliCare apps from Google Play and received eight weeks of coaching for the use of IntelliCare. Coaching included an initial phone call plus two or more text messages per week over the eight weeks. In the study, 105 participants were enrolled and 96 of them completed the study.

The preliminary study did not include a control arm, so it's possible that some people who enrolled in the trial would have improved anyway, partly because they may have been motivated to try something new, Mohr said. He now has launched a larger trial, recruiting 300 participants, with a control arm.

Some of the IntelliCare apps include:

Daily Feats: designed to motivate you to add worthwhile and rewarding activities into your day to increase your overall satisfaction in life.

Purple Chill: designed to help you unwind with audio recordings that guide you through exercises to de-stress and worry less.

Slumber Time: designed to ease you into a good night's rest.

My Mantra: designed to help you create motivating mantras to highlight your strengths and values.

""Using digital tools for mental health is emerging as an important part of our future,"" Mohr said. ""These are designed to help the millions of people who want support but can't get to a therapist's office.""

More than 20 percent of Americans have significant symptoms of depression or anxiety each year, but only around 20 percent of people with a mental health problem get adequate treatment.

The IntelliCare algorithm recommends new apps each week to keep the experience fresh, provide new opportunities for learning skills and avoid user boredom. Although the apps are not validated, each one was designed by Northwestern clinicians and based on validated techniques used by therapists.

IntelliCare is a national research study. Individuals can download the apps free with no financial obligation. But Northwestern researchers hope participants will provide confidential feedback, via four weekly questions, that will be used to further develop the system. The data will help the system make even better recommendations and provide more personalized treatment.

People also may enroll in a study in which they will be paid to provide even more feedback. Some also will have access to an IntelliCare coach via text messaging and phone calls, who are available to support them in using the apps.

""We now have evidence these approaches will likely work,"" Mohr said. ""They are designed to teach many of the same skills therapists teach patients. Different apps are expected to work for different people. The goal is to find what's right for you.""

TUESDAY, Jan. 31, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- A breath test to detect stomach and esophageal cancers shows promise, researchers say.

The test measures five chemicals in the breath. It was 85 percent accurate in detecting these cancers in more than 300 patients, the new study found.

Each year, 1.4 million cases of cancer of the stomach and esophagus (the tube leading from the throat to the stomach) are diagnosed worldwide. Both tend to be diagnosed at a late stage and the five-year survival rate for the two cancers is 15 percent, the researchers said.

Findings from the study were presented Monday at the European Cancer Congress (ECC).

""At present the only way to diagnose esophageal cancer or stomach cancer is with endoscopy. This method is expensive, invasive and has some risk of complications,"" study author Dr. Sheraz Markar said in an ECC news release. Markar is from Imperial College London in England.

With endoscopy, a flexible tube is threaded down a sedated patient's throat to the stomach to view the digestive tract.

""A breath test could be used as a noninvasive, first-line test to reduce the number of unnecessary endoscopies. In the longer term this could also mean earlier diagnosis and treatment, and better survival,"" Markar said.

""Because cancer cells are different to healthy ones, they produce a different mixture of chemicals. This study suggests that we may be able detect these differences and use a breath test to indicate which patients are likely to have cancer of the esophagus and stomach, and which do not,"" he explained.

Markar added that the test needs to be validated in a bigger group before it could be used on patients. The researchers said they are planning a larger trial of the breath test over the next three years.

Study results presented at meetings are generally considered preliminary until they've been published in a peer-reviewed journal.

"A commonly used drug could dramatically increase survival rates for men who have to fight prostate cancer twice.

The drug, a type of androgen-depleting therapy, is a frontline treatment for men who opt not to have surgery for the cancer. But the new finding indicates it could also be a valuable add-on treatment to surgery if the cancer returns.

Androgens, including testosterone, are thought to contribute to the growth and development of prostate cancer. Among men whose cancer showed signs of coming back after their prostate was surgically removed, adding a drug that blocks androgen receptors to radiation treatments halved their death rate from prostate cancer over the subsequent 12 years.

advertisement

The findings should trickle down to clinical settings “pretty quickly,” said Dr. William Shipley, chair of the genitourinary oncology unit at Massachusetts General Hospital and one of the researchers behind the study, which was published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Prostate cancer recurrence happens in about 30 percent of patients after surgery. In these cases, radiation therapy is usually used.

The specific ADT drug used in the study, bicalutamide, has since been largely replaced by another kind of drug that decreases the amount of testosterone the body produces. The effect of the newer-generation medications, gonadotropin-releasing hormones, is similar to bicalutamide, according to other trials.

AstraZeneca (AZN), which is one of the makers of bicalutamide, was a sponsor of the study, and one of Shipley’s coauthors has received honoraria and grants from the company.

Because prostate cancer can progress relatively slowly, the study — which ran from 1998 to 2003 — needed an extended follow-up period to be sure of the effects, Shipley said. The men in the trial received the ADT drugs for two years.

The study represents an important, if incremental, step for clinicians, noted Dr. William See, chair of the urology department at the Medical College of Wisconsin, who wasn’t involved in the study. “It really builds on some prior data and combines prior findings to ask and answer a new question that is quite relevant for men affected by prostate cancer.”

Some patients benefitted from adding the drugs more than others. The results were especially dramatic for men who had prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels above .07 ng/ml when they started the trial. (While that is a relatively low level for most men, PSA levels should be close to zero after a prostatectomy.) Men with medium-grade tumors and those who may not have had their entire cancer removed during surgery also survived significantly longer if they received the drug.

However, See and Shipley both noted that looking at those subsets of patients was not what the study was initially designed to do, which limits the statistical power of those conclusions. More research will be needed to confirm which men benefit most from taking the drug.

“You don’t want to treat a patient if he doesn’t need to be treated,” Shipley said."	Old drug gets new trick for prostate cancer treatment	2017-02-01 06:00:00	https://www.statnews.com/2017/02/01/drug-prostate-cancer-treatment/	story_reviews_00291	true
"Men whose prostate cancer comes back after surgery are more likely to survive if, along with the usual radiation, they also take drugs to block male hormones.

The finding, published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, comes from a long-running study that experts say will help clarify treatment for many patients.

After surgery to remove the prostate, more than 30 percent of men have a recurrence, and until now there has not been clear evidence about the best way to stop the disease from killing them. Most are given radiation, but prescribing drugs to counter the effects of male hormones has been inconsistent.

The study, paid for by the National Cancer Institute, showed that among men who received radiation and hormonal treatment, 76.3 percent were still alive after 12 years, compared to 71.3 percent who had radiation alone."

"Stem cell transplants may induce long-term remission of multiple sclerosis

Encouraging results help set stage for larger studies.

New clinical trial results provide evidence that high-dose immunosuppressive therapy followed by transplantation of a person's own blood-forming stem cells can induce sustained remission of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks the central nervous system.

“...these five-year results suggest the promise of this treatment for inducing long-term, sustained remissions of poor-prognosis relapsing-remitting MS.”

Five years after receiving the treatment, called high-dose immunosuppressive therapy and autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (HDIT/HCT), 69 percent of trial participants had survived without experiencing progression of disability, relapse of MS symptoms or new brain lesions. Notably, participants did not take any MS medications after receiving HDIT/HCT. Other studies have indicated that currently available MS drugs have lower success rates.

The trial, called HALT-MS, was sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, and conducted by the NIAID-funded Immune Tolerance Network (ITN). The researchers published three-year results from the study in December 2014, and the final five-year results appear online Feb. 1 in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.

“These extended findings suggest that one-time treatment with HDIT/HCT may be substantially more effective than long-term treatment with the best available medications for people with a certain type of MS,” said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. “These encouraging results support the development of a large, randomized trial to directly compare HDIT/HCT to standard of care for this often-debilitating disease.”

MS symptoms vary widely and may include motor and speech difficulties, weakness, fatigue and chronic pain. The most common form of MS is relapsing-remitting MS, which is characterized by periods of mild or no symptoms interspersed with symptom flare-ups or relapses. Over years, the disease can worsen and shift to a progressive form.

In HALT-MS, researchers tested the safety, efficacy and durability of HDIT/HCT in 24 volunteers aged 26 to 52 years with relapsing-remitting MS who, despite taking clinically available medications, experienced active inflammation, evidenced by frequent severe relapses, and worsened neurological disability.

The experimental treatment aims to suppress active disease and prevent further disability by removing disease-causing cells and resetting the immune system. During the procedure, doctors collect a participant’s blood-forming stem cells, give the participant high-dose chemotherapy to deplete the immune system, and return the participant’s own stem cells to rebuild the immune system. The treatment carries some risks, and many participants experienced the expected side effects of HDIT/HCT, such as infections. Three participants died during the study; none of the deaths were related to the study treatment.

Five years after HDIT/HCT, most trial participants remained in remission, and their MS had stabilized. In addition, some participants showed improvements, such as recovery of mobility or other physical capabilities.

“Although further evaluation of the benefits and risks of HDIT/HCT is needed, these five-year results suggest the promise of this treatment for inducing long-term, sustained remissions of poor-prognosis relapsing-remitting MS,” said Richard Nash, M.D., of Colorado Blood Cancer Institute and Presbyterian-St. Luke’s Hospital. Dr. Nash served as principal investigator of the HALT-MS study.

“If these findings are confirmed in larger studies, HDIT/HCT may become a potential therapeutic option for patients with active relapsing-remitting MS, particularly those who do not respond to existing therapies,” said Daniel Rotrosen, M.D., director of NIAID’s Division of Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation.

This work was sponsored by NIAID, NIH, and conducted by the ITN under award number AI109565 and NIAID-funded statistical and clinical coordinating centers under award number AI117870. The ClinicalTrials.gov identifier for the Phase 2 study High-Dose Immunosuppression and Autologous Transplantation for Multiple Sclerosis (HALT-MS) is NCT00288626.

"THOUSAND OAKS, Calif., Feb. 2, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) today announced that the FOURIER trial evaluating whether Repatha® (evolocumab) reduces the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with clinically evident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) met its primary composite endpoint (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), non-fatal stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina or coronary revascularization) and the key secondary composite endpoint (cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke). No new safety issues were observed.

The EBBINGHAUS cognitive function trial conducted in FOURIER patients also achieved its primary endpoint, demonstrating that Repatha was non-inferior to placebo for the effect on cognitive function.

Detailed results from the Repatha FOURIER outcomes trial will be presented at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) 66th Annual Scientific Session Late-Breaking Clinical Trials session in Washington, D.C. on Friday, March 17 at 8 a.m. ET. Detailed results from the Repatha EBBINGHAUS cognitive function trial will be presented at the Late-Breaking Clinical Trials session on Saturday, March 18 at 8 a.m. ET.

""In the GLAGOV study, we demonstrated that Repatha has an effect on atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of cardiovascular disease. These FOURIER results show unequivocally the connection between lowering LDL cholesterol with Repatha and cardiovascular risk reduction, even in a population already treated with optimized statin therapy,"" said Sean E. Harper, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. ""Cardiovascular disease remains the number one health burden in the world, and we look forward to sharing these outcomes data with the scientific community at the ACC 66th Annual Scientific Session.""

FOURIER ( F urther Cardiovascular OU tcomes R esearch with PCSK9 I nhibition in Subjects with E levated R isk) is a multinational Phase 3 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in approximately 27,500 patients who had either an MI, an ischemic stroke or symptomatic peripheral artery disease and an LDL ≥70 mg/dL or a non-HDL-C ≥100 mg/dL on optimized statin therapy. Optimized statin therapy was defined as at least atorvastatin 20 mg or equivalent daily with a recommendation for at least atorvastatin 40 mg or equivalent daily where approved. Patients were randomized to receive Repatha subcutaneous 140 mg every two weeks or 420 mg monthly or placebo subcutaneous every two weeks or monthly. The study continued until at least 1,630 patients experienced a key secondary MACE (major adverse cardiac event) endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI or stroke, whichever occured first.

EBBINGHAUS ( E valuating PCSK9 B inding anti B ody I nfluence o N co G nitive H e A lth in high cardiovasc U lar risk S ubjects) is a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized non-inferiority trial involving approximately 1,900 patients enrolled in the FOURIER outcomes study. Executive function (Spatial Working Memory strategy index – primary endpoint) and secondary endpoints of working memory, memory function, and psychomotor speed were assessed using a tablet-based tool (CANTAB) at baseline and select time points.

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide.1 In the U.S., there are approximately 11 million people with ASCVD and/or familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) who have uncontrolled levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) over 70 mg/dL, despite treatment with statins or other cholesterol-lowering therapies.2,3 More than 60 percent of high-risk patients in Europe are still unable to adequately lower their LDL-C levels with statins or other currently approved lipid-lowering agents.4 Among very high-risk patients, the percentage is increased to more than 80 percent.4 It is estimated that less than one percent of people with FH (heterozygous and homozygous forms) in most countries are diagnosed.5

FOURIER Study Design

FOURIER, a multinational Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, is designed to evaluate whether treatment with Repatha in combination with statin therapy compared to placebo plus statin therapy reduces cardiovascular events. The primary endpoint is the time to cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization. The key secondary endpoint is the time to cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or stroke.

Eligible patients with high cholesterol (LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL or non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [non-HDL-C] ≥100 mg/dL) and clinically evident ASCVD at more than 1,300 study locations around the world were randomized to receive Repatha subcutaneous 140 mg every two weeks or 420 mg monthly plus effective statin dose; or placebo subcutaneous every two weeks or monthly plus effective statin dose. Optimized statin therapy was defined as at least atorvastatin 20 mg or equivalent daily with a recommendation for at least atorvastatin 40 mg or equivalent daily where approved. The study was event driven and continued until at least 1,630 patients experienced a key secondary endpoint.

About Repatha® (evolocumab)

Repatha® (evolocumab) is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Repatha binds to PCSK9 and inhibits circulating PCSK9 from binding to the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR), preventing PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation and permitting LDLR to recycle back to the liver cell surface. By inhibiting the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, Repatha increases the number of LDLRs available to clear LDL from the blood, thereby lowering LDL-C levels.6

Repatha is approved in more than 40 countries, including the U.S., Japan, Canada and in all 28 countries that are members of the European Union. Applications in other countries are pending.

Important U.S. Product Information

Repatha® is indicated as an adjunct to diet and:

Maximally tolerated statin therapy for treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), who require additional lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)

Other LDL-lowering therapies (e.g., statins, ezetimibe, LDL apheresis) in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) who require additional lowering of LDL-C

The effect of Repatha® on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.

The safety and effectiveness of Repatha® have not been established in pediatric patients with HoFH who are younger than 13 years old.

The safety and effectiveness of Repatha® have not been established in pediatric patients with primary hyperlipidemia or HeFH.

Important U.S. Safety Information

Contraindication: Repatha® is contraindicated in patients with a history of a serious hypersensitivity reaction to Repatha®.

Allergic reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. rash, urticaria) have been reported in patients treated with Repatha®, including some that led to discontinuation of therapy. If signs or symptoms of serious allergic reactions occur, discontinue treatment with Repatha®, treat according to the standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve.

Adverse reactions: The most common adverse reactions (>5% of Repatha®-treated patients and more common than placebo) were: nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, influenza, back pain, and injection site reactions.

In a 52-week trial, adverse reactions led to discontinuation of treatment in 2.2% of Repatha®-treated patients and 1% of placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reaction that led to Repatha® treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo was myalgia (0.3% versus 0% for Repatha® and placebo, respectively).

Adverse reactions from a pool of the 52-week trial and seven 12-week trials:

Local injection site reactions occurred in 3.2% and 3.0% of Repatha® -treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most common injection site reactions were erythema, pain, and bruising. The proportions of patients who discontinued treatment due to local injection site reactions in Repatha® -treated patients and placebo-treated patients were 0.1% and 0%, respectively.

Allergic reactions occurred in 5.1% and 4.7% of Repatha® -treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most common allergic reactions were rash (1.0% versus 0.5% for Repatha® and placebo, respectively), eczema (0.4% versus 0.2%), erythema (0.4% versus 0.2%), and urticaria (0.4% versus 0.1%).

Neurocognitive events were reported in less than or equal to 0.2% in Repatha®-treated and placebo-treated patients.

In a pool of placebo- and active-controlled trials, as well as open-label extension studies that followed them, a total of 1,988 patients treated with Repatha® had at least one LDL-C value <25 mg/dL. Changes to background lipid-altering therapy were not made in response to low LDL-C values, and Repatha® dosing was not modified or interrupted on this basis. Although adverse consequences of very low LDL-C were not identified in these trials, the long-term effects of very low levels of LDL-C induced by Repatha® are unknown.

Musculoskeletal adverse reactions were reported in 14.3% of Repatha® -treated patients and 12.8% of placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions that occurred at a rate greater than placebo were back pain (3.2% versus 2.9% for Repatha® and placebo, respectively), arthralgia (2.3% versus 2.2%), and myalgia (2.0% versus 1.8%).

Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH): In 49 patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia studied in a 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 33 patients received 420 mg of

Repatha® subcutaneously once monthly. The adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2 (6.1%) Repatha®-treated patients and more frequently than in placebo-treated patients, included upper respiratory tract infection (9.1% versus 6.3%), influenza (9.1% versus 0%), gastroenteritis (6.1% versus 0%), and nasopharyngitis (6.1% versus 0%).

Immunogenicity: Repatha® is a human monoclonal antibody. As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity with Repatha®.

"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc said its potent cholesterol fighter Repatha significantly reduced the risk of heart attacks, strokes and death in patients with heart disease, according to initial results of a large, eagerly-anticipated trial released on Thursday. The data should pave the way for greater acceptance by health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, who have been rejecting about 75 percent of prescriptions written for the expensive medicine despite multiple appeals by physicians.

No new safety problems cropped up in the 27,500 patient study called Fourier, Amgen said. It also said Repatha’s effect on mental function was similar to placebo, likely alleviating concerns that it might impair cognition in some patients.

The trial was widely expected to be positive, especially after a smaller study presented in November showed Repatha therapy led to regression of artery-clogging plaque, an underlying cause of heart disease.

“These results show unequivocally the connection between lowering LDL cholesterol with Repatha and cardiovascular risk reduction, even in a population already treated with optimized statin therapy,” Amgen research chief Sean Harper said in a statement.

Details on the magnitude of benefit will be revealed in mid-March at the American College of Cardiology meeting in Washington, D.C. Industry analysts have been looking for a 15 percent to 20 percent reduction of major adverse heart events.

Repatha, with a list price of more than $14,000 a year, was approved based on its ability to dramatically lower “bad” LDL cholesterol in patients who require more intensive therapy on top of widely-used statins, such as Lipitor, or who are unable to tolerate statins.

But those who control budgets wanted concrete proof that the drug could actually reduce the risk of heart attacks and death before making it easier for patients to get the medicine.

Repatha and a rival drug from Regeneron Corp and Sanofi have had endured anemic sales as a result.

Amgen reported just $40 million in third-quarter sales. The company said Repatha would be well on its way to becoming a $1 billion seller if all prescriptions written had been filled.

The primary and secondary goals of the study are composites of several adverse outcomes. At the heart meeting in March, researchers will also provide details on risk reduction for each of the components, such as non-fatal heart attack, non-fatal stroke, and heart-related death.

The primary goal also included need for a new artery-clearing procedure and hospitalization for angina."	Amgen cholesterol drug succeeds in cutting serious heart problems: study	2017-02-02 22:23:49	http://www.reuters.com/article/us-amgen-cholesterol-idUSKBN15H2SG	story_reviews_00292	true

Special for USA TODAY

Would a life without onions, garlic, apples and most bread be worth living?

For growing numbers of people suffering from digestive ills, the answer is ""yes,"" at least for a while.

They are trying something called the low-FODMAP diet, an experimental eating plan developed in Australia and now getting some scientific backing and commercial buzz in the United States. The diet is aimed primarily at people with irritable bowel syndrome, a common condition in which abdominal pain and irregular bowel habits — with diarrhea, constipation or both — can wax and wane for years.

Followers are asked to eliminate, and then try to reintroduce, a long list of foods containing certain carbohydrates that might trigger gas, bloating, pain and diarrhea. FODMAP is an acronym for those carbohydrates: fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols.

The theory is that FODMAPs, found in many fruits, vegetables, grains, dairy foods and sweeteners, are poorly digested by susceptible people. The undigested carbohydrates can draw extra fluid into the digestive tract and end up in the colon, where they are “feasted upon” and fermented by gut microbes, leading to all sorts of misery, says Lauren Van Dam, a registered dietitian at the University of Michigan.

If giving up some foods might lessen that misery, many people are game, she says. “We have some patients that are literally housebound because they are worried they are going to have an accident or because they have terrible pain,” Van Dam says.

Barbara DeLancey, a 63-year-old registered nurse from Ann Arbor, says she was crippled by 10-times-a-day diarrhea when she agreed to try the diet a year ago. “I was resistant at first because it seemed so restrictive,” she says. She got teary-eyed at the grocery store, seeing all the food she could not have.

But eventually she learned she could tolerate and add back some favorites, including garlic and apples. She credits the diet, along with medication, with a big reduction in her symptoms, but says “it has not been a miracle cure.”

The diet has generated enough interest to prompt some food companies to introduce low-FODMAP products — hoping for a market surpassing that for gluten-free foods, according to some industry reports.

In 2014, IBS treatment guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology said the diet showed promise, but that the quality of evidence was “very low.""

Since then, several studies have strengthened the case for the diet, says guideline co-author Brian Lacy, a professor of medicine and chief of gastroenterology at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, N.H. Still, one study from Sweden showed no advantage over a less-restrictive dietary approach that eliminates fewer foods and stresses changes such as smaller, more frequent meals.

""The data are not overwhelming,” Lacy says. “But I think it’s a reasonable thing to try.”

The largest study so far, with 92 patients, was conducted at University of Michigan. It found that 52% of low-FODMAP patients and 41% of patients on a less-restrictive diet reported “adequate relief.” The difference was not statistically significant, says study co-author William Chey, a professor of gastroenterology. But low-FODMAP patients did get significantly better relief from pain and bloating and greater gains in mood, body image and overall quality of life, he says.

Medications, probiotics, fiber supplements and other approaches still have roles in treating IBS, and no one approach works for all patients, Chey and Lacy say.

It’s not known if the diet leads to any nutritional deficiencies or keeps working in the long run — especially for patients who get little support from doctors or dietitians.

“Physicians are largely administering the diet by giving patients sheets of paper with foods to exclude,” Chey says. Ideally, all would be referred to dietitians, Chey and Lacy agree. But few dietitians are trained in the diet, and insurers typically do not cover the visits, Lacy notes.

When patients do make their way to Kate Scarlata, a Boston area registered dietitian who specializes in the diet, the first thing she tells them is that it “is a dietary experiment. It’s a short-term learning diet.”

Van Dam does the same — explaining that after a few weeks she will help clients reintroduce foods one carbohydrate category at a time.

“Most are able to identify some high-FODMAP foods they can tolerate very well and some they can tolerate a little, but not in high portions every day,” she says. “Our goal is for them to be on the most varied, nutritious diet possible.”

The trickiest part is avoiding onions and garlic, the dietitians say. They teach clients strategies such as using (safe) garlic-infused oils, avoiding restaurant sauces and soups and topping salads with oil and vinegar.

Mapping FODMAP

High- and low-FODMAP food lists are updated frequently at websites and apps run by the University of Michigan and Monash University in Australia.

Here is a sampling from the Michigan site. (Note: the site receives funding from Nestle Health Science, which is marketing low-FODMAP products).

Foods to avoid

Dairy: Milk, ice cream, yogurt, cottage and ricotta cheeses (except for lactose-free versions)

Fruits: Apples, peaches, pears, watermelon, cherries, figs

Vegetables: Garlic, onions, leeks, asparagus, cauliflower or large servings (more than ½ cup) of broccoli and Brussels sprouts

Grains: Wheat (except in sourdough bread), rye, barley

Legumes and nuts: Cashews, kidney beans, soy beans and soy milk

Sweeteners: Honey, fructose, xylitol, agave syrup

Foods to include

Dairy and dairy substitutes: Kefir, almond milk, coconut milk

Fruits: Bananas, blueberries, grapes, oranges, strawberries

Vegetables: Carrots, green beans, bell peppers, potatoes, tomatoes

Grains: Rice, oats, gluten-free bread (but check labels for high-FODMAP ingredients)

Legumes and nuts: Peanuts, pecans, walnuts

"(CNN) A new blood test may be as accurate as a test requiring a painful spinal tap for differentiating Parkinson's disease from similar disorders, according to a study published Wednesday in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.

Parkinson's disease is a neurological disorder that can cause tremors, stiffness, slowness of movement, trouble balancing, problems walking and difficulty coordinating movement. Less obvious symptoms include depression, insomnia, anxiety, fatigue and constipation.

Neurological disorders that mimic the symptoms of Parkinson's disease are called atypical parkinsonism disorders.

Many doctors cannot tell whether a patient has Parkinson's disease or atypical parkinsonism.

""This can be very challenging, especially during the early stages of the diseases and if the responsible doctor is not a neurologist specialized in movement disorders,"" said Dr. Oskar Hansson, lead author of the new study, a neurologist and an associate professor at Lund University in Sweden.

Non-specialists ""do not really know exactly what questions to ask the patient and the special signs to look for,"" Hansson wrote in an email. Yet patients with atypical disorders ""usually have a much worse prognosis, with faster disease progression, (with) more disabling symptoms"" than Parkinson's patients, so early identification is crucial.

The correct diagnosis is also key to treatment since ""most patients with atypical parkinsonism disorders do not respond well to dopamine-targeting medications"" that are usually prescribed for Parkinson's patients, Hansson said.

Validating a new biomarker

Hansson and his colleagues developed a blood test that is, essentially, a variation on an existing test capable of detecting neurofilament light chain protein in spinal fluid. This protein is a component of nerve cells, and when these cells die, it can be detected in both spinal fluid and blood.

Because spinal fluid is not easily obtained by a primary care doctor, this diagnostic test is not very useful, so Hansson developed a blood test and investigated its accuracy in the new study.

When validating a new biomarker for disease, ""one should always analyze at least two different (groups of patients and controls) to make sure that the results are reproducible,"" said Hansson, who added that participants should also include both early- and late-stage patients established at different clinics.

All told, a total of 244 people with Parkinson's and 79 healthy volunteers serving as a comparison group participated in Hansson's study, along with 181 patients with atypical parkinsonism disorders.

Of these, 88 patients had multiple system atrophy, which impairs the body's involuntary functions such as heart rate, blood pressure and digestion.

Seventy patients had progressive supranuclear palsy, which affects movement, walking, balance, speech, swallowing, vision, mood and thinking.

And 23 patients had corticobasal degeneration, which causes decreased movement on one side of the body, muscle rigidity, tremor and a disconnection between thought and action.

Testing these participants, the researchers found that nerve protein levels ranged higher in people with atypical parkinsonism and lower in patients with Parkinson's disease as well as the healthy volunteers. However, the test cannot distinguish between the different atypical disorders, which doctors must rely on symptoms to diagnose.

Blood test accuracy is defined based on sensitivity, the percentage of positives that are correctly identified, and specificity, the percentage of negatives that are correctly identified. In Sweden, the blood test had a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 91%, while in the United Kingdom, sensitivity was 80% and specificity 90%. For early-stage study participants, generally, sensitivity was 70% and specificity was 80%.

Overall, the blood test showed equal accuracy as the spinal fluid test when diagnosing Parkinson's or an atypical parkinsonism disorder, in both early and later stages of disease.

Hansson imagines that blood-based tests will be used in the future ""in the diagnostic work-up of patients with parkinsonism by most doctors who are not very specialized with these movement disorders."" He also believes the test will be used by specialists for Parkinson's patients who ""do not exhibit a very typical symptomatology"" or do not respond as expected to treatment.

Misdiagnosis is common

The prevalence of Parkinson's in the general population increases from about 1% at age 60 to 4% by age 80, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . ""Atypical parkinsonism disorders are not as common as Parkinson's disease,"" said Dr. Jeff Bronstein, a professor of neurology and director of movement disorders at David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. He was not involved in the new study.

Usually, patients are first diagnosed with Parkinson's, and only later do their doctors discover that they have one of the more rare neurodegenerative atypical parkinsonism disorders, which are most likely to affect people in their 50s and 60s and represent approximately 10% to 20% of all cases originally diagnosed as Parkinson's

Though atypical parkinsonism conditions look very similar to Parkinson's at first, they ""have a different underlying molecular cause,"" according to Bronstein, and so it is important to recognize them early in order to treat them properly. ""Disease-specific therapies are now in trials, so accurate diagnosis is essential in determining if these new treatments work,"" he said.

According to Dr. Paul Wright, chairman of neurology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, New York, and Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, New York, the importance of this study is that it brings to light that there are new biomarker tests that can delineate between these neurological diseases.

""A lot of time, people come in and say they or a family member has a tremor, and they believe it's Parkinson's disease,"" said Wright, who also was not involved in the study. This early assumption may impede diagnosis of a less recognized atypical parkinsonism condition.

Or a patient has ""horrible blood pressure fluctuations,"" Wright said, and no obvious tremor or rigidity symptoms, so a doctor suspects a heart condition. Instead, the cause is multiple system atrophy, a neurodegenerative disease. Though other symptoms will show up eventually and help in diagnosing the patient, in the meantime, the patient will be receiving the wrong medicines.

An accurate blood test, then, would be good news in these situations.

""It's a lot more reassuring to a patient to say 'we're just going to take a blood test to check for a few things,' "" Wright said. ""It's much easier and less anxiety-provoking for patients than taking a spinal tap.""

Up until now, many diseases have been diagnosed based on symptoms, with patients asking, ""How do you know I have this?"" Meanwhile, doctors are not always correct, Wright said. This is true even of Parkinson's, which is diagnosed based on symptoms, a patient's history, neurological exams, a patient's response to medicine and, in some cases, brain imaging tests.

Still, Wright is hopeful and believes a biomarker test for Parkinson's ""will be down the line. ... In general, researchers are looking for biomarkers of disease.""

Specialists and sub-specialists are available only in big cities, Wright said, and access to a simple blood test would enable a correct diagnosis in a primary care office.

""We always assume there's luxury,"" Wright said. ""But that's not really what's real in most of the country."""	Blood test might make Parkinson's diagnosis easier, study says	2017-02-08 06:00:00	http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/08/health/parkinsons-disease-blood-test-study/	story_reviews_00287	true
"Cassandra Quave, an Emory University scientist who studies how indigenous people use plants in healing practices, said researchers pulled apart the chemical ingredients of the berries and tested them in mice infected with these superbug strains. The mice got injections containing the bacteria with or without the plant extracts. Those that didn't receive the extracts developed skin lesions. But in the other mice, the extracts -- a mixture of 27 chemicals -- prevented skin lesions from forming.

AD

AD

Instead of destroying the bacteria, the ingredients in the fruit weakened the bacteria by preventing them from producing the toxins it uses as weapons to damage tissue. The extracts from the fruit repress a gene that allows the bacterial cells to communicate with one another.

“It weakens the bacteria so the mouse’s own defenses work better” to clear the infection, she said. The plant extracts didn't harm the skin tissues or the normal, healthy bacteria found on skin.

The discovery may hold the potential for new ways to treat and prevent antimicrobial-resistant infections, an enormous global problem that was the focus of a rare high-level United Nations summit last fall.

AD

MRSA has become a serious threat to human health; in 2011, it was responsible for more than 80,000 invasive infections and more than 11,000 deaths in the United States, according to federal statistics.

AD

Antimicrobial resistance refers to infections that have evolved the ability to withstand drugs that ought to stop them. The medicines include antibiotics, which act on bacteria, as well as drugs to fight fungal, viral or parasitic infections. Fighting bacteria with drugs designed to kill them helps fuel the problem of antibiotic resistance if stronger bacteria can survive and evolve to become “superbugs.”

“But instead of always setting a bomb off to kill an infection, there are situations where using an anti-virulence method may be just as effective, while also helping to restore balance to the health of the patient,” said Quave.

Plants have been used repeatedly in traditional medicine over the centuries, and knowledge about their use is passed down from generation to generation, which points to their efficacy, she said.

AD

AD

“People don’t save that knowledge over centuries” if something doesn’t work, she said. “We’re trying to answer the question: Does this work against bacteria, and how does it work, and is it safe to use?”

The Brazilian peppertree, a shrubby tree native to South America, is an invasive species throughout the southern United States, particularly in Florida, where it’s sometimes called the Florida holly or broad-leaf peppertree, and is considered a noxious weed. The woody plant has long been a staple in Brazilian traditional medicine. Its leaves and bark are used to treat wounds, ulcers, burns and skin infections, Quave said.

Less is known about the plant’s fruit, which was used traditionally as topical poultices for infected wounds and ulcers.

AD

From an ecological standpoint, Quave said, it makes sense that invasive weeds have a chemical advantage that may help protect them from diseases so they can spread more easily in a new environment.

AD

But she said the average person shouldn’t try to use the weed to make their own medicine. “Not everything that is natural is safe,” she said.

Her lab at Emory is doing additional research to confirm the safest and most effective way of using the plant extract. Researchers would still need to conduct pre-clinical trials to test its medicinal benefits.

"“Bariatric surgery is probably the most effective intervention we have in health care,” says Laurie K. Twells, a clinical epidemiologist at Memorial University of Newfoundland. She bases this bold claim on her experience with seriously obese patients and a detailed analysis of the best studies yet done showing weight-loss surgery’s ability to reverse the often devastating effects of being extremely overweight on health and quality of life.

“I haven’t come across a patient yet who wouldn’t recommend it,” Dr. Twells said in an interview. “Most say they wish they’d done it 10 years sooner.” She explained that the overwhelming majority of patients who undergo bariatric surgery have spent many years trying — and failing — to lose weight and keep it off. And the reason is not a lack of willpower.

“These patients have lost hundreds of pounds over and over again,” Dr. Twells said. “The weight that it takes them one year to lose is typically back in two months,” often because a body with longstanding obesity defends itself against weight loss by drastically reducing its metabolic rate, an effect not seen after bariatric surgery, which permanently changes the contours of the digestive tract.

In reviewing studies that followed patients for five to 25 years after weight-loss surgery, Dr. Twells and colleagues found major long-lasting benefits to the patients’ health and quality of life. Matched with comparable patients who did not have surgery, those who did fared much better physically, emotionally and socially. They rated themselves as healthier and were less likely to report problems with mobility, pain, daily activities, social interactions and feelings of depression and anxiety, among other factors that can compromise well-being."

"When U.S. Marine Chris Merkle returned from his last tour of duty in Afghanistan, his family was thrilled to have him back.

But for Merkle, the welcome home was also accompanied by some dark problems. He couldn’t sleep. He was irritable and had anger issues. He would avoid certain stressful situations, like driving in traffic. And he would stay on high alert in the classroom.

“And then soon, they’re like, 'You’re not the same,'” Merkle recalled of what his family told him. “They start to notice that you’re not really enjoying the parties of our friends. You only get really excited when you're going to visit former Marines and the people you used to hang out with.”

Chris Merkle

Merkle served three tours in Iraq and four in Afghanistan. Re-adjusting to being a civilian was tough, he said, and he was finding it difficult to function.

“There was almost 5, 10 years of deploying back and forth back and forth -- there was this void, this monster in the room that’s not talked about until finally it came out. It was like, 'You need to see somebody. Something is going on with you.'""

While Merkle was a patient at the VA, he heard of a clinical psychologist named Skip Rizzo at the University of Southern California Institute of Creative Technologies. Merkle was trying traditional one-on-one therapy and said that at the time, “it wasn’t really taking that well.” He was looking for an alternative and heard about Skip’s research that used a new and unexpected way to treat post-traumatic stress disorder -- with virtual reality.

Nearly 8 million adults suffer from PTSD during a given year, according to the National Center for PTSD. The condition can occur after someone has been exposed to a significant stressor and often includes symptoms such as avoidance, hyper-vigilance, anger issues and mood swings. One common method for treatment is called “exposure therapy.” The patient recounts their trauma, visualizing it in their imagination, and narrates it to a clinician. By repeatedly confronting and processing the trauma, the brain can start to reduce the level of anxiety and response to those memories.

That’s exactly the approach Rizzo uses with virtual reality therapy.

“My mission is to drag psychology kicking and screaming into the 21st century,” Rizzo said, noting that virtual reality offers a unique opportunity for clinicians and clients alike: to be immersed in the environment that evokes the original trauma, rather than relying on the patient’s imagination.

Rizzo has created 14 virtual “worlds” for patients, and clinicians can add custom elements, including helicopters, clouds, small-arms fire and missiles.

USC Institute for Creative Technologies

“The first thing to keep in mind is that we are never going to replicate an exact simulation of what the patient went through,” Rizzo said. “But we really don’t need to.”

Merkle explained how the virtual reality experience works. “Your brain assumes, 'OK, this must be where we’re at,' and it fills in the blanks. And as you’re talking through it, you feel like you’re physically there.”

Each session lasts for about an hour and a half, and the patient speaks about their experience with a clinician as they go through the virtual simulation.

For Merkle, virtual reality allowed him to start unlocking memories and work through his trauma.

“So, it really allowed me to open the door and begin my healing process,” he said. “I’m still a work in process obviously but I’m so far forward, leaps and bound beyond where I would have been without virtual reality.”

"Yvonne Felix’s eyes don’t work well enough on their own for her to read, recognize faces or cross the street without help. But when the Toronto-based artist and mother puts on a new kind of camera-equipped headgear, she looks at me like no one has before.

The visor that allows legally blind people to see is no longer Star Trek fiction. Leaps in augmented-reality technology are being used to help people with severely low vision gain back enough sight to function, and then some.

Ms. Felix, who has Stargardt disease, wears a device from a company called eSight. The eSight 3—which weighs less than a quarter of a pound and is operated by hand-held remote—captures the world through a camera system and then displays it on OLED screens that sit very close to the eyes. Legally blind people like Ms. Felix have some limited vision, and eSight’s displays are tuned to make use of it. By dialing up contrast and allowing users to zoom in, it can dramatically amplify sight without a surgical procedure.

“Being able to see that people’s pupils actually dilate and contract is quite amazing,” she says. The gear has allowed Ms. Felix to get a desk job and travel on her own. She’s also become a spokeswoman for eSight.

Efforts to make noninvasive vision tech started decades ago with bulky TV-like devices that magnify and increase the contrast on books. In the 1990s, NASA developed space goggles with a camera and two black-and-white cathode-ray-tube screens.

To Star Trek fans, this system recalls the blind “Next Generation” series character who wore a vision visor. “I remember thinking that Geordi La Forge was my hero and that one day there would be something like that and when it came out, I wanted to try it,” says Ms. Felix, who is 36.

The eSight visor, in development for 10 years, is reaching a level of maturity. The third-generation, which debuts this week, weighs less, has a wider field of view and just looks cooler. ESight—along with other makers of head-mounted low-vision aids such as Orcam and Nu-Eyes—is taking advantage of tech that is cheaper, smaller and faster because of popular gadgets like smartphones and virtual-reality headsets.

The camera-equipped eSight 3, which weighs less than a quarter of a pound, uses VR-like displays to bring images close to the user's eyes. Photo: Emily Prapuolenis/The Wall Street Journal

When Ms. Felix allowed me to try on her visor, the images I saw were very high contrast, and the screens were positioned to allow me to also make use of my natural peripheral vision. The battery lasts about 6½ hours.

Using the hand-held controller, users can zoom and pan, like on a street sign, or plug in a TV feed directly. Because of those capabilities, Ms. Felix said in some cases eSight probably lets her see better than me.

“There is no device that’s a magic solution for all problems,” says Walter Wittich, an assistant professor at the University of Montreal’s School of Optometry, who is part of the first independent research project into the tech. Still, Mr. Wittich says it can be useful for the people with low vision who benefit from magnification, for whom most current options are hand-held.

Not everyone feels equally comfortable operating the gear. Mr. Wittich plans to release initial results from the study in May, and says one thing that is clear is that people who click with eSight immediately see a boost in quality of life. “It is working very well for some people already, and there is still quite a bit of potential in both the design and electronic capability,” he says.

ESight says its tech has worked for about three quarters of the people who have tried it. Their biggest hurdle is getting the technology paid for. They have sold about a thousand to date, and this new visor costs $10,000. While the device has FDA clearance as a Class I medical device, most insurance doesn’t cover it.

“That is a battle we are starting to wage,” says eSight Chief Executive Brian Mech. Some employers and other third parties have picked up the tab, he says, but the challenge is to reach users who have limited resources because their vision challenges keep them from work.

“Yes, that is an expensive piece of equipment, but it can really do a lot for people,” says Gislin Dagnelie, an associate professor of ophthalmology at Johns Hopkins and an adviser to the company. While the National Federation of the Blind estimates there are 1.3 million legally blind people living in the U.S., Mr. Dagnelie thinks at least a hundred thousand people could benefit from eSight’s tech.

For an artist like Ms. Felix, it has offered more than routine improvement. She worked for decades in sculpture and thick paint, because she felt her work as much as she saw it. Her favorite artist was Vincent van Gogh, because he also likely suffered from vision problems.

She recalls the first time she saw “Starry Night” with her eSight visor on, it made her cry. “I saw every little stroke. When I saw the color mixtures and how thick the paint was, it was the most overwhelming moment of my life,” she says. “I thought that never in my life would I be able to see something so beautiful.”

MONDAY, Feb. 20, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Stem cell transplants may halt the progression of aggressive multiple sclerosis (MS) in nearly half of those with the debilitating disease, but picking the right patients for the treatment is key, a new study suggests.

Specifically, younger patients with a relapsing form of MS who were not severely disabled and who hadn't found relief with other treatments fared better than others over five years, the international team of researchers found.

However, in some cases the treatment proved fatal, the researchers reported.

""Stem cell transplantation cannot be considered a cure for MS. However, it can be considered a concrete option for patients showing aggressive MS who have not responded to approved treatments,"" said study co-author Dr. Riccardo Saccardi. He's from the cell therapy and transfusion medicine unit at Careggi University Hospital in Florence, Italy.

Using patients' own stem cells to reboot the immune system is a way to halt the advance of the disease. But the treatment can be risky because the patient's immune system has to be wiped out before the stem cells are transplanted, the researchers said.

In fact, nearly 3 percent of the patients died shortly after receiving the transplant, and those deaths were directly related to the transplant, the researchers reported.

Those deaths are a major concern, one neurologist said, because MS is not in itself life-threatening.

In effect, those patients gambled with a treatment that could be fatal for a disease that isn't, said Dr. Michael Racke, a professor in the department of neurology at Ohio State University.

Racke pointed out that stem cell transplants were first used to treat deadly diseases, such as leukemia, lymphoma and other cancers.

""There may be a population of MS patients that could be identified that might do well with transplant,"" he said. ""It's important to select patients in such a way that they actually get well with the transplant.""

A trial that compares stem cell transplants with other therapies to see whether stem cell transplants can become a treatment for patients who have progressive MS is about to start, added Racke, who co-authored an editorial that accompanied the study.

More than 2 million people in the world suffer from MS, in which the body attacks the central nervous system, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.

MS can cause many symptoms, including blurred vision, loss of balance, poor coordination, slurred speech, tremors, numbness, extreme fatigue, problems with memory and concentration, paralysis and blindness.

These symptoms can come and go, or persist and worsen over time. Most people are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, although individuals as young as 2 and as old as 75 have developed the disease, the society says.

Medications can slow the progression of MS and help patients manage symptoms, but there's no cure.

To see how patients did over the long term after stem cell transplants, Saccardi and colleagues followed 281 patients from 13 countries who received stem cell transplants between 1995 and 2006.

The researchers found that 46 percent of the patients experienced progression-free survival at five years after transplant.

Within 100 days of transplant, however, eight patients died (nearly 3 percent). Those deaths were related to the transplants, Saccardi said.

The researchers think these deaths were most likely due to the transplant technology used before 2006, which has since improved.

The report was published online Feb. 20 in the journal JAMA Neurology.

Dr. Paul Wright is chair of neurology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., and Long Island Jewish Medical Center, in New Hyde Park, N.Y. He said, ""As neurologists battle with current therapies that are limited for progressive MS in younger patients, this study provides a possible new avenue for treatment.""

"Step inside the lounge at Evolved Science and you’ll find a cocktail menu unlike any you’ve ever seen.

The ritzy Manhattan medical office — which says it serves high-powered clients and celebrities — shakes and stirs up tailored IV infusions using a slurry of vitamins and amino acids. There’s a Jet Lag Eraser, for use after hopping off a long international flight, a Detoxification saline smoothie for “improving alertness and mental acuity,” and a Late Night Rescue cocktail to undo the effects of too many actual cocktails the night before.

The company claims liquid vitamins, minerals, and amino acids delivered straight to the bloodstream can protect users from getting a cold, boost athletic performance, “annihilate toxins,” and stave off headaches. “We put together the ideal combination for them to obtain the results they want: clearer skin, clearer mind, better hair, better nails,” said Dr. Erika Schwartz, who runs the clinic.

advertisement

And though the IV lends a medical air to the procedure, the infusions suffer from the same problem as many supplements taken orally — there isn’t any robust evidence to back up their health claims.

“Supplements don’t fix anything and they don’t prevent anything. It’s simple,” said Dr. Pete Miller, a clinician and nutrition researcher at Johns Hopkins.

The Evolved Science clinic in New York. Evolved Science

Vitamin IV infusions aren’t anything new. Celebrities from Simon Cowell and Rihanna to the Real Housewives have proclaimed their love for vitamin drips. They’re part of a huge — and wildly popular — supplement industry which goes largely unregulated. Supplement makers aren’t allowed to claim that their products can cure or treat a particular condition, but they are allowed to make sweeping claims that the products promote health.

The infusion treatments can be traced back to an intravenous supplement known as the Myers’ cocktail, a slurry of magnesium, calcium, B vitamins, and other products developed decades ago by a Baltimore physician. There is a published review on the use of Myers’ cocktail — but it’s just a collection of anecdotal evidence. The author, Dr. Alan Gaby, has long promoted the use of intravenous vitamins for a wide range of clinical conditions.

The research on injectable vitamins of any kind is thin and the results unimpressive. One study looked at injectable vitamins to treat asthma, but there was no placebo group to compare outcomes against. Two studies have examined intravenous vitamin use in fibromyalgia patients. One didn’t turn up any significant improvement in patients who received the infusions. The other — which was also missing a placebo group — involved just seven patients and showed only short-term improvement in symptoms.

Schwartz, though, said the supplements are completely safe.

“We’re doing it in a sterile environment, it’s administered by a nurse, and everything is sterile,” she said. “The only difference is it’s kind of a beautiful environment.”

Customers at Evolved Science shell out anywhere from $325 to $875 for an infusion. For first-time clients, Schwartz recommends weekly injections for the first month or so, and then a routine infusion once a month. Patients kick back in cream-colored chairs together while they’re hooked up to IVs in the “infusion lounge.”

“It doesn’t look like a doctor’s office. It’s very relaxed, not like a spa. But like a private club. It’s a SoHo house kind of thing,” said Schwartz, a former trauma surgeon.

But as for whether they’ll help a client prepare for an important presentation?

“There is not not substantial evidence that vitamin supplements have a large impact on cognitive function,” said Dr. Francine Grodstein, a public health researcher at Harvard who has studied the subject. A longitudinal study would be needed to back those claims with evidence, she added.

Still, the trend seems to be going strong. The I.V. Doc — an in-home vitamin infusion service — offers on-demand nutrient drips in places including Boston, Los Angeles, Chicago, and the Hamptons. In Las Vegas, hangover buses deliver pick-me-up infusions on the go.

And despite a lack of sound evidence, experts expect consumers to keep coming back for infusions.

“What drives the market is not the science,” said Miller. “In spite of that lack of evidence, there’s still a market for it.”"	Vitamin IVs make bold health promises. But where's the evidence?	2017-02-23 06:00:00	https://www.statnews.com/2017/02/23/vitamin-iv-infusion/	story_reviews_00279	true

"A Medicine That Blunts The Buzz Of Alcohol Can Help Drinkers Cut Back

Enlarge this image Maria Fabrizio for NPR Maria Fabrizio for NPR

If you drink more alcohol than you want to or should, you're not alone. A nationwide survey by the National Institutes of Health found that 28 percent of adults in the U.S. are heavy drinkers or drink more than is recommended.

Yet, most heavy drinkers don't get the help they need.

""The biggest problem we have in the field is that less than 10 percent of individuals with an alcohol use disorder get any treatment whatsoever,"" says George Koob, director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.

Part of the challenge, researchers say, is that many drinkers don't realize that a medicine long used to help people addicted to opioids quit their drug habit can help alcoholics and other heavy drinkers cut back, too.

""I thought my only option was AA,"" John tells NPR. We've agreed to use only his middle name; disclosing his trouble with alcohol publicly, he says, would jeopardize his business.

He's a 47-year-old professional who says he started out as a social drinker — a few beers with his softball team after a game. But he sank into a deep depression after several deaths in his family, and sought ""solace in the bottle,"" he says.

""I wanted to numb my thoughts,"" says John.

He'd often start with hard liquor in the morning, John says, and it wasn't uncommon to have eight drinks or more before the end of the day.

He worked from home, so he was able to mask the problem for a while. But eventually his wife confronted him.

""She had come home and I was rushing to hide a glass and she was furious with me,"" he recalls. ""Just absolutely furious.""

He went to see Paula DeSanto, a therapist and director of Minnesota Alternatives, in Spring Lake Park, Minn. The center provides outpatient mental health and substance use treatment services.

""I would say John's story is not unique,"" DeSanto tells us. ""A lot of people are reluctant.""

Sometimes, traditional treatments — such as residential rehab or a 12-step program like Alcoholics Anonymous — ""can [lead to] a significant disruption in their lives,"" she explains. ""There's stigma, shame and embarrassment.""

DeSanto suggested a different approach to John. To help work through the loss and grief he was feeling, counseling can help, she told him. She also recommended he try naltrexone, a prescription drug.

""Naltrexone is an effective medication for the treatment of alcohol use disorders,"" says Koob. He points to a recent meta-analysis published in the journal Addiction that concluded that naltrexone helped reduce heavy drinking and cravings for alcohol.

The analysis included data from 64 clinical trials in which people were given either the medication or a placebo pill to test the effectiveness of the treatment. The analysis also found that another drug, acamprosate, is effective at helping people who have already stopped drinking to maintain abstinence, perhaps partly by easing the physical and emotional cravings experienced by heavy drinkers who quit.

So, how does naltrexone work? The drug seems to curb the euphoric and sedative effects of opiates in the brain. Alcohol is known to activate some of the same receptors in the brain that opioids do, and studies find that by tempering the pleasure from alcohol, naltrexone can help people drink less.

""It blunts the effects of alcohol,"" says Koob. ""People [who use naltrexone] will say they have a drink, and it's not doing much for them.""

That was exactly John's experience. After taking the naltrexone pill, he didn't get the buzz he was used to getting, so didn't want to keep drinking. ""I actually didn't feel the alcohol's effects,"" he says. ""It was startling.""

It's now been about five months since he started taking the medication. He has not stopped drinking completely, but says he has cut way back.

""This is helping me,"" John says. ""I can go out with friends and not worry that I'm going to end up inebriated or sloppy.""

According to the findings of a recent review, both naltrexone and acamprosate, are safe, cost-effective and efficacious. But they are substantially underused, according to the review.

Many physicians are ""unaware that there are medications to treat alcohol use disorders,"" says Koob. His institute is stepping up efforts to work with the medical community on that front, he says, and is also touting Rethinking Drinking, a website aimed at consumers that offers the latest research-based information on a range of treatment options.

Any health care provider who is licensed to prescribe medicine can prescribe naltrexone — not just mental health professionals or addiction specialists. As as long ago as 1997, a published study showed that treatment of alcohol dependence with naltrexone by primary care doctors can be effective; follow-up research has confirmed that the primary care approach not only works, but makes treatment much more accessible.

According to the NIAAA, ""patients can now receive effective alcohol treatment from their primary care doctors or mental health practitioners by combining the newer medications with a series of brief office visits for support.""

Naltrexone is certainly not a cure-all, researchers say. And it won't help everyone who has a drinking problem — especially if the disorder is severe.

""I use these medications as an adjunct to therapy, and group [sessions] and 12-step meetings"" says Dr. Jeffrey Hsu, a psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins University who is certified in addiction medicine. He says that when used alone the medicines are only modestly effective.

But there's good evidence that the combination of counseling and drugs such as naltrexone can help people cut back on drinking, or move toward abstinence."	A Medicine That Blunts The Buzz Of Alcohol Can Help Drinkers Cut Back	2017-02-27 06:00:00	http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/02/27/516890375/a-medicine-that-blunts-the-buzz-of-alcohol-can-help-drinkers-cut-back	story_reviews_00277	true
"(Boston)--Despite the continued controversy surrounding the use of testosterone in men who have testosterone deficiency (hypogonadism), a new study has found that long-term use of testosterone therapy not only improves vigor and vitality, but may reduce the risk of death due to cardiovascular (CV) disease.

These findings appear online in the Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

Testosterone (T) is the primary male sex hormone. In men, T plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle and bone mass and growth of body hair. In addition, T is essential for overall health and well-being and for the prevention of osteoporosis. Insufficient levels of circulating T in men, contributes to frailty and bone loss.

In the absence of large, prospective, placebo-controlled clinical trials of longer duration, substantial evidence regarding the safety and risk of testosterone therapy (TTh) with regard to cardiovascular outcomes can only be gleaned from observational studies. To date, there are limited studies comparing the effects of long-term TTh in hypogonadal men who were treated or remained untreated with T.

Researchers at Boston University Schools of Medicine (BUSM) and Public Health (BUSPH), along with researchers in Germany, established a registry to assess long-term effectiveness and safety of T in men. For this study, they sought to compare its effects on a host of parameters (obesity, cholesterol levels, diabetes, liver function) considered to contribute to cardiovascular disease.

The researchers followed a group of men for eight years who had been on TTh and compared them with another group of men who remained untreated for the same time period. They found there were only two deaths in the TTh group and neither was related to CV events. In the non-treated control group, there were 21 deaths, 19 of which were related to CV events. Furthermore, there were 26 non-fatal myocardial infarctions and 30 non-fatal strokes in the control group but none in the T-treated group.

According to the researchers, long-term TTh in men with hypogonadism appears to be an effective approach to achieve sustained improvements in cardiometabolic function and reduces the risk of CV events. ""The low CV events observed in the T-group compared to the untreated (control) group strongly suggest that TTh is protective. We believe that the protective effect of T on the CV system provides clinicians with the opportunity to utilize this approach for secondary prevention for hypogonadal men with a history of CV events,"" explained corresponding author Abdulmaged M. Traish, PhD, professor of biochemistry and urology at BUSM.

"A new investigational delivery method for localized vaginal estrogen therapy that utilizes an applicator free softgel to alleviate moderate-to-severe vaginal pain during intercourse (dyspareunia), a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA), received high rates of patient satisfaction among post-menopausal women, according to post-trial survey results published in the journal Menopause.

""These survey results show that something as simple as a change to a more elegant delivery system that is easier to use and not messy might empower more post-menopausal women to seek prescription treatment for VVA, and perhaps help them stay with the application guidelines for longer,"" said study first author Sheryl Kingsberg, PhD, Division Chief, OB/GYN Behavioral Medicine, UH Cleveland Medical Center; Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Psychiatry, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine; and first author of the survey analysis. ""We still have to find better ways to educate the millions of women suffering with VVA about the symptoms, however, so that more of them know it is common, decide to discuss treatment with their healthcare professional, and seek symptom relief with appropriate treatment.""

The new results were part of a multi-center randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trial for TX004HR, an investigational bio-identical 17β-estradiol applicator free vaginal softgel capsule. Previous publications have shown TX004HR to be safe and effective at alleviating symptoms of VVA. The survey, which included 731 respondents with a 96 percent response rate, sought to quantify participants' satisfaction with the application method and overall treatment delivery system. The majority of women taking either TX004HR or placebo (85.4 - 92.1 percent) found the product easy to use.

VVA is a chronic condition associated with genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM). VVA affects 50 to 70 percent of post-menopausal women, and is characterized by pain with sexual activity, dryness, and discomfort. Current on-the-market treatments for VVA include both over-the-counter creams and moisturizers as well as several safe and effective prescription treatments in cream, tablet, ring or oral form.

Previous survey research completed by Dr. Kingsberg and others has shown that while 32 million women may be experiencing symptomatic VVA and suffering from related impacts on sexual function, interpersonal relationships, self-esteem and overall quality of life, only 7 percent are currently using a prescription therapy to alleviate symptoms. Though they may suffer from physical and emotional pain as a result of VVA, women may not feel comfortable discussing these symptoms with a healthcare professional, may not recognize the symptoms as treatable, may not fully understand the treatment options available, or if they did receive treatment, found the current prescription treatment options inconvenient, messy, or uncomfortable to use.

"What if you could lose weight and reduce your risk of life-threatening disease without any changes in what you eat -- other than a five-day special diet once every few months?

That's what happened for 71 adults who were placed on three cycles of a low-calorie, ""fasting-mimicking"" diet. The phase II trial, conducted by researchers at the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, demonstrated a host of benefits from the regimen.

The diet reduced cardiovascular risk factors including blood pressure, signs of inflammation (measured by C-reactive protein levels), as well as fasting glucose and reduced levels of IGF-1, a hormone that affects metabolism. It also shrank waistlines and resulted in weight loss, both in total body fat and trunk fat, but not in muscle mass.

In effect, the diet reduced the study participants' risks for cancer, diabetes, heart disease and other age-related diseases, according to the findings published Feb. 15 in Science Translational Medicine.

""This study provides evidence that people can experience significant health benefits through a periodic, fasting-mimicking diet that is designed to act on the aging process,"" said Valter Longo, director of the USC Longevity Institute and a professor of biological sciences for USC Davis and Dornsife. ""Prior studies have indicated a range of health benefits in mice, but this is the first randomized clinical trial with enough participants to demonstrate that the diet is feasible, effective and safe for humans.

""Larger FDA studies are necessary to confirm its effects on disease prevention and treatment,"" he added.

One hundred people participated in the trial from April 2013 to July 2015. The participants, ages 20 to 70 and all generally healthy, were divided into two groups for the randomized trial.

Participants in the first group, the control group, were asked to continue their normal eating habits for three months. People in the second group were placed on a three-month test of the fasting-mimicking diet.

Those on the special diet were required to eat food products supplied by the nutrition company L-Nutra during the fasting periods of five days each month. The diet, which was designed to mimic the results of a water-only fast, allowed for participants to consume between 750 and 1,100 calories per day. The meals for the fast-mimicking diet contained precise proportions of proteins, fats and carbohydrates.

After three months, participants in the control group were moved onto the special diet.

The researchers found that participants on the fasting-mimicking diet lost an average of about 6 pounds. Their waistlines shrank by 1 to 2 inches. Their systolic blood pressure, which was in the normal range when the study began, dropped by 4.5 mmHG, while their diastolic blood pressure dropped by 3.1 mmHg. Also, their levels of IGF-1 dropped to between 21.7 ng/mL and 46.2 ng/mL, reaching a range associated with lower cancer risk.

""After the first group completed their three months on the fasting diet, we moved over participants in the control group to see if they also would experience similar results,"" Longo said. ""We saw similar outcomes, which provides further evidence that a fasting-mimicking diet has effects on many metabolic and disease markers. Our mouse studies using a similar fasting-mimicking diet indicate that these beneficial effects are caused by multi-system regeneration and rejuvenation in the body at the cellular and organ levels.

""Our participants retained those effects, even when they returned to their normal daily eating habits,"" he added.

The researchers also noted that participants considered ""at risk"" because they had risk factors such as high IGF-1, cholesterol, blood pressure or blood sugar levels, made significant progress toward better health.

For example, baseline fasting glucose levels for participants with high blood sugar levels (putting them at risk for diabetes) dropped into the healthy range, below 99 mg/dl -- but these levels didn't drop among participants who already had healthy levels at the beginning of the study. Cholesterol was reduced by 20 mg/dl in those with high cholesterol levels, and by about 5 mg/dl in all participants.

""Fasting seems to be the most beneficial for patients who have the great risk factors for disease, such as those who have high blood pressure or pre-diabetes or who are obese,"" Longo said.

The researchers had invited participants in the study for one last set of tests three months later, at the end of the diet. The research team found that the beneficial effects -- from weight loss, smaller waistlines and lower glucose, blood pressure and IGF-1 levels -- were sustained.

The next step for researchers is a large, FDA phase III clinical trial to test the FMD on patients diagnosed with age-related diseases or at high risk for them. The researchers said further investigation will determine whether the benefits of the diet can continue for several months.

"ANN ARBOR, Michigan -- Even as treatment options for laryngeal cancer seemed to improve, survival rates did not. For the most advanced patients, 50 percent survival was the norm, whether patients had surgery to totally remove the voice box or alternative treatment with chemotherapy and radiation to try to avoid surgery.

But the head and neck oncology team at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center came up with a different approach: Give patients a single dose of chemotherapy and see who responds to it. The responders can continue with combination chemotherapy and radiation. The non-responders can be referred immediately for surgery.

After a decade of using this approach, researchers are reporting ""exceptional"" survival rates nearing 80 percent, even for the most advanced patients. The team published their outcomes in JAMA Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery.

""In trying to match the biology of the tumor to the treatment, all of the patients get better outcomes,"" says study author Gregory T. Wolf, M.D., professor and chair emeritus of otolaryngology - head and neck surgery at Michigan Medicine.

""This approach allows us to enhance quality of life for all of our patients. Many patients can spare their voice box by having chemotherapy and radiation. But that's only good if the treatment works. For patients who must go on to receive surgery, by selecting them up front, we can spare them the complications that may occur when the voice box is removed following multiple cycles of chemotherapy with radiation,"" adds study author Francis Worden, M.D., professor of hematology/oncology.

The Michigan Medicine team first tested the idea in 1995. They found that patients whose tumor shrunk by more than half after one round of chemotherapy were more likely to do well with chemotherapy and radiation and have an excellent chance of saving their voice box. If the tumor did not respond after that first dose, patients would likely fail on the chemotherapy and would do better going straight to surgery.

In a clinical trial, they saw disease-specific survival rates of 80 percent in patients with advanced disease. This was unheard of. And it wasn't just those who responded to the chemotherapy. The non-responders who were immediately referred for surgery had better outcomes too.

""We adopted the treatment approach and started offering it to all our laryngeal cancer patients,"" Wolf says. As part of a Specialized Program of Research Excellence, or SPORE, grant, the team was already maintaining long-term follow-up data on patients. Wolf suggested they look back and see if they were still maintaining such strong outcomes with this approach. The results surprised even him.

Over 10 years, 153 stage 3 and 4 laryngeal cancer patients were treated at Michigan Medicine, with about half receiving the induction chemotherapy. The remainder elected to proceed straight to surgery or chemo-radiation without the induction dose.

Average disease specific survival at five years for the induction chemotherapy patients was 79 percent - equivalent to the results in patients with early stage disease, and significantly better than the 66 percent survival for patients who had chemo-radiation without the induction strategy.

""This adds ammunition to the idea that we need to pick individual therapies more carefully. Both chemo-radiation and surgery are difficult treatments with their share of challenging long-term effects. But if we tailor treatments to the individual biology of the tumor and characteristics of the patient, we'll get the best results,"" Wolf says.

The study did find lower functional preservation of the larynx in the induction chemotherapy group compared to those who elected chemoradiation. Two-thirds of the induction group achieved organ preservation, while more than three-quarters of the chemo-radiation patients did.

Wolf notes, however, that chemoradiation often severely damages the larynx, which may cause problems with eating or swallowing years later.

The induction approach can be done anywhere, but requires intense collaboration among surgeons, medical oncologists and radiation oncologists. All three must be involved to assess the patient and refer to the appropriate therapy.

Even that single dose of chemotherapy can be debilitating and toxic for some patients. Wolf hopes future research will reveal a way to tailor treatment without the need for the induction chemotherapy.

"A new biologic agent--the most potent of its kind so far--is showing early promise as part of a potential new strategy for treating HIV. The drug, known as 10-1074, may also offer a new way to prevent viral infection in people who are at high risk to acquire HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

The drug belongs to a class of molecules called broadly neutralizing antibodies, which are naturally found in HIV-infected people whose immune systems have a rare ability to fight off the virus. These antibodies are a major area of study in the laboratory of Rockefeller University investigator Michel Nussenzweig, who is Zanvil A. Cohn and Ralph M. Steinman Professor and head of the Laboratory of Molecular Immunology. Marina Caskey, an Assistant Professor of Clinical Investigation, leads clinical studies on these antibodies.

""This was the first human trial of 10-1074,"" says Till Schoofs, an Instructor in Clinical Investigation in Nussenzweig's lab. ""The antibody binds to a different part of the virus than the other antibody we've studied. In addition, it's one of the most potent broadly neutralizing antibodies described to date.""

Today, HIV is typically treated with antiretroviral therapy, a drug regimen that became available in the 1990s. Although it has been a lifesaver for people infected with the virus, antiretroviral medications have significant drawbacks: they can cause severe side effects, and patients have to take them for life. This is why researchers continue to look for other ways to control the virus--and broadly neutralizing antibodies could prove to be part of an alternate treatment strategy.

The study of 10-1074, an early-stage clinical trial, included 19 individuals who were infected with HIV and 14 who were not. The purpose was to determine whether the antibody was safe and whether it had antiviral activity in humans. The majority of the people in the trial were enrolled at The Rockefeller University Hospital, while some of the HIV-1 infected participants received the antibody at the University of Cologne, in Germany. ""It has been challenging to find trial participants with high levels of the virus here in New York,"" Caskey says, ""so our collaboration with the University of Cologne has been very valuable.""

The investigators found that among 13 HIV-infected people who received the highest dose of 10-1074, 11 showed a rapid decline in the amount of virus. Although these patients were found to have some resistant virus in their blood, further research in the lab showed that those viruses were still sensitive to other broadly neutralizing antibodies, including 3BNC117, that target different parts of the pathogen. The results were published in January in Nature Medicine.

Caskey, Schoofs, and their team also analyzed the uninfected participants' blood samples, and found that 10-1074 may be an effective way to prevent infection in people who are exposed to the virus. Currently, people who do not have HIV but are at substantial risk of getting it--because they have multiple sexual partners, for example, or an HIV-infected partner--can receive antiviral medications to prevent disease, a strategy called pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). But just like the antiviral medications used to treat infection, PrEP can have severe side effects and must be taken daily to be effective, which poses significant challenges to adequate compliance.

""Based on our findings we think these types of antibodies could be a viable substitute for the drugs currently used in PrEP,"" says Caskey. ""But to clearly demonstrate that these antibodies have an advantage over the pill that's currently used, we would need to test them in large numbers of people and show that they remain active for a prolonged period of time in the body.""

In an effort to accomplish this, the investigators are looking into modified variants of the antibodies with prolonged activity, so that they would need to be given less often in the PrEP setting. And they are already moving forward with new clinical studies using 10-1074 together with 3BNC117, with the hope that combining two antibodies targeting different parts of HIV will be more effective than either antibody on its own.

"Postmenopausal estrogen-based hormone therapy lasting longer than ten years was associated with a decreased risk of Alzheimer's disease in a large study carried out at the University of Eastern Finland.

""The protective effect of hormone therapy may depend on its timing: it may have cognitive benefits if initiated at the time of menopause when neurons are still healthy and responsive,"" says Bushra Imtiaz, MD, MPH, who presented the results in her doctoral thesis.

The study explored the association between postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy, Alzheimer's disease, dementia and cognition in two nation-wide case-control studies and two longitudinal cohort studies. The largest study comprised approximately 230,000 Finnish women and the follow-up time in different studies was up to 20 years.

Menopause may explain women's higher dementia risk

Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, and two out of three Alzheimer's cases are women. One possible explanation for women's higher dementia risk is the postmenopausal depletion of sex steroid hormones estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen receptors are present throughout the body including brain areas primarily affected in Alzheimer's disease. In in vitro and animal studies, estrogen has showed neuroprotective effects. However, studies on humans have yielded inconsistent results on the association between postmenopausal estrogen-based hormone replacement therapy and dementia risk.

Hormonal therapy may protect cognition if started at the onset of menopause

In the present study, long-term use of hormonal replacement therapy was associated with a better performance in certain cognitive domains - global cognition and episodic memory - and a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease. Short-term use was not significantly linked to dementia risk, but in one cohort, dementia risk was higher among short-term users who had started hormone therapy in the late postmenopausal period. The results were adjusted for various lifestyle, socioeconomic and demographic variables.

""In the light of these findings, hormonal replacement therapy may have a beneficial effect on cognition if started early, around the time of menopause. The protective effect of hormonal therapy may depend on the health status of neurons at baseline and may be lost if therapy starts years after menopause,"" Dr Imtiaz concludes.

The study also showed that the postmenopausal removal of ovaries, uterus or both was not significantly linked to the risk of Alzheimer's disease, irrespective of the indication of surgery or hormone therapy use.

The research data was from the MEDALZ (Medication use and Alzheimer's disease), OSTPRE (Kuopio Osteoporosis Risk Factor and Prevention Study) and CAIDE (Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Dementia) studies. The newest results were published recently in Neurology and Maturitas and the earlier results in the Journal of Alzheimer's disease.

"OAK BROOK, Ill. - MRI screening improves early diagnosis of breast cancer in all women-not only those at high risk-according to a new study from Germany published online in the journal Radiology.

MRI has long been known as an effective breast cancer screening modality that offers better sensitivity than mammography and ultrasound. Currently, guidelines reserve breast MRI screening for women who have a strong family history or other specific breast cancer risk factors. MRI screening has not been considered necessary for women at average risk, and there has been resistance to expansion of MRI into this population due, in part, to concern over higher costs.

However, with breast cancer remaining a major cause of cancer death in women, there is good reason to pursue the search for improved screening methods, according to the study's lead author, Christiane Kuhl, M.D., chair of the Department of Radiology at RWTH Aachen University in Aachen, Germany.

Between 2005 and 2013, Dr. Kuhl and colleagues studied breast MRI's impact on 2,120 women, ages 40 to 70, with less than a 15 percent lifetime risk of breast cancer. The women had normal screening mammograms and, in the case of those with dense breast tissue, normal screening ultrasound. Breast MRI detected 60 additional breast cancers, including 40 invasive cancers, for an overall supplemental cancer detection rate of 15.5 per 1,000 women. Of the 60 cancers detected in the study group over the observation period (7,007 screening rounds), 59 were found only using MRI, one was found also by mammography, and none by mammography or ultrasound alone.

According to Dr. Kuhl, the results suggest that MRI can serve as a useful supplemental screening tool for women at average risk, especially those with dense mammographic tissue, and that MRI is superior to supplemental ultrasound for this purpose.

The results also highlight the ability of MRI in the detection of more aggressive types of cancer.

""The faster a cancer grows and the better it is in seeding metastases, the better will it be picked up early by MRI,"" Dr. Kuhl said. ""In our cohort, cancers found by MRI alone exhibited features of rapid growth at pathology.""

This ability is especially important in women with dense breast tissue in which aggressive cancers may be missed on mammography. Left undetected, these cancers will grow to become clinically palpable cancers, also known as interval cancers. The new study showed that, consistent with previous research, breast MRI can depict these rapidly growing cancers with high reliability.

According to Dr. Kuhl, interval cancers exhibit an adverse biologic profile and are the main driver of breast cancer mortality. Additional cancers detected by MRI screening in the study had a skewed distribution towards a higher-than-normal prevalence or incidence of rapidly growing (grade 3) cancers.

""The interval cancer rate in our study was zero percent. Not a single cancer was undetected that became palpable,"" she said. ""This suggests that MRI finds breast cancers that also mammography would find, but MRI detects them earlier, and it finds the cancers which, if MRI had not been done, would have progressed to interval cancers.""

"A new study from Karolinska Institutet in Sweden shows that short-course preoperative radiotherapy combined with delayed surgery reduces the adverse side-effects of rectal cancer surgery without compromising its efficacy. The results are presented in the journal The Lancet Oncology.

Rectal cancer affects some 2,000 men and women in Sweden every year. Preoperative radiotherapy was gradually introduced in the early 1990s, with a consequent improvement in prognosis for people with rectal cancer and reduction in the risk of local recurrence.

""Back then we showed that preoperative radiotherapy reduces the risk of local recurrence by over 50 per cent for patients with rectal cancer,"" says principal investigator Anna Martling, senior consultant surgeon and professor at Karolinska Institutet's Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery. ""Thanks to our results, radiotherapy is recommended to many rectal cancer patients.""

However, radiotherapy can cause adverse reactions and the optimal radiotherapeutic method and the interval between it and the ensuing surgery have been mooted. The study now presented in The Lancet Oncology is based on the claim that the adverse effects of rectal cancer treatment can be reduced by administering more but lower doses of radiation for a longer time, or by increasing the interval between radiotherapy and surgery. These hypotheses have now been tested in a study in which rectal cancer patients were randomly assigned to three different treatment arms:

Standard therapy, i.e. short-course (5x5 Gy) radiotherapy with direct surgery within a week.

Delayed surgery with short-course (5x5 Gy) radiotherapy followed by surgery after 4-8 weeks.

Delayed surgery with long-course (25x2 Gy) radiotherapy followed by surgery after 4-8 weeks.

The results of the study show that patients with delayed surgery develop fewer complications with equally good oncological outcomes. It also showed that there is no difference between long-course and short-course radiotherapy other than that the former considerably lengthens the time for treatment.

""The results of the study will give rise to improved therapeutic strategies, fewer complications with a sustained low incidence of local recurrence, and better survival rates for rectal cancer patients,"" says Professor Martling. ""The results can now be immediately put to clinical use to the considerable benefit of the patients.""

"HOUSTON, Feb. 23, 2017 - stroke patients receiving clot-busting medications before arriving at the hospital have a lower risk for disability afterward, according to research presented at the American Stroke Association's International Stroke Conference 2017.

Researchers analyzed results from 658 stroke patients who were treated with tPA - a drug that dissolves blood clots. About half of the participants received the clot-busting drug at the hospital, and half received it while still in the ambulance.

This preliminary study showed that three months after stroke, 182 out of every 1,000 patients treated before arriving at hospital were less disabled, including 58 patients who had zero disability, compared to people who received treatment after reaching the hospital.

""Time is brain in acute stroke after vascular collaterals fail, and faster treatment yields better outcomes,"" said May Nour, M.D., Ph.D., lead researcher, interventional neurologist and director of UCLA's Mobile Stroke Rescue Program. ""Our study shows pre-hospital clot-busting is a promising, evolving approach to providing tPA stroke therapy. Its better outcomes could offset the increased costs of a mobile stroke unit.""

Past research showed the sooner that a clot-busting tPA drug is given after an ischemic stroke - one in which a clot is blocking blood flow - the better patients fare. But tPA is not indicated and could hurt a patient's chances if they are having a hemorrhagic stroke, in which a blood vessel ruptures. That is why patients need a CT scan to confirm the type of stroke before receiving tPA.

Every second counts, in the current standard of care, patients who experience stroke-like symptoms and call 9-1-1 arriving to the hospital by ambulance are assessed by clinical examination and imaging (CT or MRI scan) in the Emergency Department. This takes a certain amount of time from the patient's symptom onset which prompted the 9-1-1 call.

In a mobile stroke unit, a specialized ambulance is equipped with a CT scanner, a paramedic, a critical care nurse, a CT technologist and a neurologist in person or by telemedicine. The ambulance arrives, does the CT on-site, gives the clot-busting drug if indicated and then transports the patient to the hospital.

Nour's team used data from Berlin's PHANTOM-S study, which took place from 2011 to 2015 and included 427 participants (median age 72) which were compared to 505 patients who received conventional care with in-hospital clot busting. Researchers analyzed information about patients' disabilities to determine how many needed to be treated in the mobile stroke unit to yield a greater benefit in disability outcomes when compared to patients who received tPA at the hospital.

The findings bordered on statistical significance, suggesting that future clinical trials with a greater number of patients are needed to show similar benefits.

""People should know the warning signs of stroke and call 9-1-1 as soon as they observe stroke signs,"" said Nour. ""Treatment then needs to happen as quickly as possible, and a mobile stroke unit may allow that to happen.""

"February 28, 2017 - For infants with congenital malformations of the ear, a treatment system called EarWell can gently reshape the ear--avoiding the pain and cost of later surgery, reports a study in the March issue of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery®, the official medical journal of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS).

But treatment must begin early--preferably within the first three weeks after birth, according to the study by ASPS Member Surgeon H. Steve Byrd, MD, and colleagues of Pediatric Plastic Surgery Institute, Dallas. Dr. Byrd comments, ""The EarWell system is effective in eliminating or reducing the need for surgery in all but the most severe congenital ear malformations.""

Nonsurgical Treatment Avoids Later Consequences of Infant Ear Malformations

The researchers review their experience with nonsurgical correction of congenital ear malformations in 175 infants. The EarWell system is a relatively simple technique for molding and reshaping the ear, taking advantage of the increased malleability of the ear cartilage in newborns. For best results, treatment should start within the first three weeks after birth, or correspondingly later in infants born prematurely.

The technique and length of EarWell treatment varies according to the type and severity of the infant's ear deformity. Dr. Byrd and colleagues present a classification system and technical details for plastic surgeons to follow in evaluating the best treatment for specific types of malformations.

For most infants in the study, both ears were treated, for a total of 303 ears. Ninety-eight percent of infants had relatively mild ""constricted""-type ear deformities. EarWell treatment started at an average age of 12 days and continued for 37 days, including an average of six follow-up visits to the plastic surgeon's office.

EarWell treatment was highly successful in correcting or reducing the severity of congenital ear malformations. Results were judged good to excellent in 97 percent of ears with one simple deformity and 88 percent with more complex ""mixed"" deformities. About 70 percent of ears with constricted malformations were graded as having no deformity after treatment.

Complications consisted mainly of skin injuries that healed without further problems. In eight cases, treatment had to be stopped because of an allergic reaction to the adhesive tape used.

While the EarWell system is not new, the report is the largest study of congenital ear malformations treated with this approach--including a standardized approach to treatment and assessment of the results. The results strongly support its use, especially in infants with deformities and less-severe malformations.

But lack of awareness of this nonsurgical alternative is a key limiting factor. ""The opportunity for early treatment can be hampered by a failure to convince pediatricians that the majority of misshapen newborn ears do not self-correct,"" Dr. Byrd and coauthors write. They also point out that EarWell is highly successful in the treatment of prominent ears--a condition that commonly goes unnoticed by parents and pediatricians, but is likely to get worse as the child grows.

""While we can operate on ears later in the patient's life, waiting not only increases the surgery's difficulty and expense, but may expose the child to teasing, bullying, and loss of self-esteem,"" comments Editor-in-Chief Rod J. Rohrich, MD, in a featured video on the Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery website. ""If your baby has any type of ear deformity, plastic surgeons can help with or without surgery. Discuss non-surgical, ear molding alternatives with your pediatrician, and consult with a board-certified plastic surgeon...the earlier the better!""

Nonsurgical treatment can correct congenital ear malformations in infants	2017-02-28 06:00:00	https://web.archive.org/web/20170228191841/https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-02/wkh-ntc022817.php	news_reviews_00273	true
"Newswise — ARLINGTON, Va., March 1, 2017 – Results from a new prospective clinical trial indicate that high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy administered in a single, 19 Gray (Gy) treatment may be a safe and effective alternative to longer courses of HDR treatment for men with localized prostate cancer. The study is available online in the International Journal of Radiation Oncology ● Biology ● Physics, the flagship journal of the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO).

With brachytherapy, also known as internal radiation therapy (RT), implants are surgically inserted in or near cancerous tissue to deliver a curative radiation dose directly to the tumor while limiting exposure for surrounding healthy tissue. Reducing this exposure is of particular concern for treating tumors in the prostate, which is surrounded by multiple critical structures. In contrast to low-dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy, where radioactive seed implants are placed permanently in the body and gradually deposit low levels of radiation over a period of months, HDR treatments deposit the dose in one treatment, after which the radioactive implant is removed from the patient.

Typically, HDR brachytherapy is administered in four to as many as nine treatment sessions, which generally requires multiple invasive procedures to insert the implants. While the number of sessions can be streamlined by increasing the dose given in each session, data on the safety and tolerability of highly escalated brachytherapy doses are still relatively new and therefore limited. In this study, researchers found that patients who received a single fraction of 19 Gy HDR brachytherapy experienced similar clinical outcomes as with LDR brachytherapy, but with the convenience of a single visit.

“It is becoming apparent that patients may be treated definitively for their prostate cancer in as little as a single day with a minimally invasive outpatient procedure,” said lead study author Daniel J. Krauss, MD, a radiation oncologist at Oakland University’s William Beaumont School of Medicine in Royal Oak, Michigan. “We found that patients generally can resume normal activities the following day with typical side effects.”

The study, which appeared in the Red Journal’s January 2017 issue, presented the results of a nonrandomized, prospective clinical trial of 58 patients with low- or intermediate-risk (non-metastatic) prostate cancer, with a median follow-up period of 2.9 years. All patients received a single, 19 Gy fraction of HDR brachytherapy. The median patient age was 63 years (range 43-73), and 91 percent of the patients presented with stage T1 disease.

At an average of nearly three years following treatment, cancer control rates were favorable and the toxicity profile was highly favorable. Three patients experienced recurrence or progression, yielding an estimated three-year cumulative biochemical control rate of 93 percent. Within the six months following HDR therapy, seven patients (12.1%) experienced grade 2 urinary side effects, most commonly frequency/urgency (6.9%). No patients experienced short-term grade 3+ urinary toxicity or grade 2+ gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. Rates were similarly modest for long-term side effects. Six patients (10.3%) experienced chronic grade 2 urinary toxicity and one patient (1.7%) experienced grade 3 chronic GI toxicity that subsequently resolved. No patients experienced long-term grade 3+ urinary toxicity or grade 4 GI toxicity.

“This study illustrates that a potentially curative dose of radiation may be delivered safely to the prostate entirely in a single administration,” said Dr. Krauss. “Giving the entire dose in a single treatment theoretically could have had a greater negative impact on the normal tissues in close proximity to the prostate—meaning the bladder, urethra and rectum—but this was not found to be the case. Toxicity rates were extremely low, with essentially no major complications encountered in this initial group of 58 patients.”

While findings highlight the potential tolerability of a single fraction of HDR brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer, the article also emphasizes the need for additional follow-up to compare long-term cancer control rates with conventional treatment approaches, which generally administer larger cumulative doses than the 19 Gy dose used in this trial.

“As the follow-up interval lengthens, 19 Gy dosing in a single fraction may or may not be sufficient to result in cure rates comparable to historical standards. One thing that this study has made clear, however, is that the extremely low toxicity and complication rates leave room to escalate the single fraction dose in subsequent trials,” said Dr. Krauss. “While additional study and longer follow-up are necessary to confirm the optimal dose for single-fraction HDR brachytherapy, we are optimistic that the single-treatment approach can eventually become a standard practice for prostate cancer treatment.”

"MADISON, Wis., March 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- A study from Exact Sciences Corp. (Nasdaq: EXAS) and Mayo Clinic released today by the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) shows promise for the development of a blood-based lung cancer test. Researchers conducted a multi-round study of nearly 400 patients, which demonstrated high accuracy for detecting lung cancer at all stages.

""These results reveal an opportunity to detect lung cancer from a simple blood draw,"" said Kevin Conroy, chairman and CEO of Exact Sciences. ""Our collaboration with Mayo Clinic is efficiently identifying biomarkers for additional cancer applications on the same technology platform as Cologuard.""

AACR released an abstract of the study today, ahead of the presentation of the results on April 2, 2017, during the AACR 2017 annual meeting. The findings from the study of 398 patients (311 controls and 87 cancers) demonstrate that biomarkers in plasma achieved high accuracy for all types and stages of lung cancer. Using two independent regression modeling approaches, a panel of four novel methylated DNA markers demonstrated a sensitivity of 91-96 percent at a specificity of 90-94 percent.

""More studies are needed to corroborate accuracy, however, this plasma DNA test approach appears to be a promising new method and may serve as a rational follow-up to the common findings of lung nodules on CT scanning and may have application in screening for lung cancer,"" said David E. Midthun, M.D. a pulmonologist at Mayo Clinic.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality, resulting in 1.7 million deaths globally and more than 150,000 deaths in the United States every year. Most symptoms present in the late stages of the disease, when the survival rate is only four percent. Early detection of lung cancer offers the opportunity to reduce mortality. Lung cancer screening is approved for smokers using chest CT scanning. This approach has a sensitivity for lung cancer above 90 percent, but its specificity may fall below 75 percent (a false positive rate of more than 25 percent) because indeterminate lung nodules are so common. Evaluation of these false-positives leads to unnecessary, costly and potentially harmful procedures.

""A blood-based test may help guide next steps after a scan reveals an indeterminate nodule,"" Mr. Conroy said. ""For example, a positive blood test might suggest the need for a biopsy or surgery. In contrast, a negative test might suggest a less aggressive approach. Such a test could offer the opportunity to significantly improve health outcomes and reduce the financial impact on the health care system.""

The abstract is available here.

A poster presentation of the findings will take place Sunday, April 2, 2017, from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. EDT at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington, D.C., Halls A-C, Poster Section 30.

"(Reuters Health) - When a migraine strikes, patients might one day be able to make the experience less painful by using a smartphone-controlled device to deliver mild electric shocks to their arm, a company-funded experiment suggests.

The experimental gadget, Nerivio Migra, is a patch with a battery, electrodes and a computer chip that can wirelessly communicate with mobile devices. It’s designed to stimulate nerves under the skin in the arm and block pain signals from reaching the brain.

“All stimulation treatments given so far have been in the head,” said lead study author Dr. David Yarnitsky, an advisory board member for Theranica, the company developing the device.

“We worked on stimulation at a far away location, which makes the treatment more convenient and more discrete so people can use it even during working hours without anyone noticing,” Yarnitsky added by email.

The study involved 71 people with episodic migraines who had two to eight attacks a month and had not taken drugs to prevent the episodes for at least two months.

Participants were typically in their mid-to-late 40s and had been experiencing about five migraines a month. Most of them were female, and more than half of them reported experiencing what’s known as aura

Overall, participants had a total of 299 migraines during the study period.

Researchers asked participants to put the device on their upper arm as soon as possible after the start of a migraine and use it for 20 minutes. They were also asked not to take any medicines for migraines for two hours after the start of the episode.

For the experiment, researchers randomly programed the devices to give either placebo stimulation at a very low frequency or deliver one of four levels of active electrical stimulation treatment.

The four active treatment programs were set at a pulse rate of 80 to 120 Hertz (Hz) with pulse widths of 200, 150, 100 and 50. People feel less stimulation at lower pulse widths. At higher pulse widths than this device used, people might feel their muscles contract.

When researchers excluded the lowest pulse width, they found 64 percent of people in the other active treatment groups had at least a 50 percent pain reduction two hours after treatment, compared with 26 percent of people in the placebo group.

At the highest level of stimulation, 58 percent of the people who started out with moderate to severe pain reported little or no pain after treatment. So did 24 percent of people in the placebo group.

The timing of treatment also mattered.

People who started using the device within 20 minutes of the start of a migraine reported average pain reductions of 47 percent, compared to a 25 percent reduction in pain for people starting the device later.

Even though the study’s participants were not told whether they were assigned active or placebo treatment, one limitation of the experiment is that participants often stopped placebo treatments before the recommended 20-minute course of stimulation was done, the authors note in Neurology.

The technology known as transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) that was tested in the current study has been examined in other devices for migraine pain for decades, said Dr. Jean Schoenen, a neurology researcher at the University of Liege in Belgium who wasn’t involved in the current experiment.

One shortcoming of the current study is that researchers didn’t examine how long the pain relief lasts beyond two hours, Schoenen said by email.

“Rapid and sustained relief is what patients want,” Schoenen added.

If the device works in larger trials and becomes widely available for migraine patients, it might offer an alternative for people who can’t tolerate migraine drugs or an option patients could try in addition to medication when they don’t get enough pain relief from drugs alone, Schoenen said.

“The percentage of attacks for which TENS is sufficient as sole treatment and allows sustained pain relief remains to be determined,” Schoenen cautioned.

"Parents of children with autism take note. It may be possible to predict autism in infants as young as 6 months who have older siblings with the disorder, according to a new study by a national network of researchers.

Infants in such families are at increased risk of developing autism, which is typically diagnosed when a child is 2- to 3-years-old and develops symptoms such as challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, delayed speech or nonverbal communication.

Researchers used magnetic resonance imaging — or MRI — to scan the brains of 343 infants when they were 6 months, 12 months and 24 months old. Two-thirds of the infants were high risk, having an older sibling with autism. The scans showed that 70 percent of high-risk toddlers diagnosed with autism at age 2 had an elevated amount of cerebrospinal fluid around their brains at 6 and 12 months, compared to toddlers who were not diagnosed with autism. Cerebrospinal fluid is a clear, colorless liquid that bathes the brain and spine.

On the left: MRI of a baby who was not diagnosed with autism at age 2. Note the decreased amount of CSF. UNC Health Care / UNC School of Medicine

This excess fluid “could possibly be an early biological marker for autism,” said Mark Shen, the lead author of the article, published in Biological Psychiatry, and a post-doctoral fellow at the University of North Carolina’s Carolina Institute for Developmental Disabilities. Additional studies are needed to confirm the finding, he said.

Such a marker would allow doctors to identify infants at high risk of developing autism before symptoms are present.

“The earlier we can get biological markers for autism, the earlier intervention can be initiated, and the greater the chance of better outcomes, ” said David Kennedy, Ph.D., co-director of the Child and Adolescent NeuroDevelopment Initiative at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Typically, therapists work with children and parents to improve eye contact, social interactions and communication skills.

The study results are “very exciting,” said Dr. Adriania Di Martino, a professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at NYU Medical School. Excess brain fluid may be more than an early marker for autism, Di Martino said. It may also be a mechanism in the development of autism, and it opens up new possibilities for research, she said. “You can start thinking about conditions that might lead to increased cerebrospinal fluid.”

Shen and his colleagues are already looking for genes associated with excess brain fluid. Normally, the liquid, refreshed four times a day, washes away byproducts that build up in the brain. But if the fluid is not flowing properly, these byproducts hang around and cause inflammation, which could “hamper brain development” and lead to autism, said Shen.

Completely different mechanisms may be at work for kids without an older sibling with autism, said Shen and Dimartino. More studies are needed, they said.

Parents with children with autism should not rush to their pediatrician demanding brain MRIs for younger siblings, Shen said.

“We wouldn’t recommend that every high-risk infant get an MRI until we know that the accuracy can be improved closer to the 90 percent range” from the current 70 percent, Shen told TODAY.

He and his colleagues are working on improving accuracy by combining their brain fluid findings with other recent research. In addition to flushing out the brain’s garbage, brain fluid also delivers signals to the brain that tell it how and when to grow. In a study published last month in Nature, 80 percent of infants diagnosed with autism as toddlers had an increased rate of growth in the surface area of their brains in their first year, compared to toddlers who were not diagnosed with autism.

“We’re going to combine those two markers to see if we can improve the prediction closer to the 90 percent range, where it could be really clinically useful,” said Shen.

About 1 in 68 children develop autism in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, But as many as 20 out of 100 infants with an older sibling with autism will develop the disorder, said Di Martino."

"(Reuters Health) - Improvement or worsening of chest pain symptoms and quality of life after a CT scan of the heart may depend on what the scan finds, a large study suggests.

People who have coronary artery disease ruled out by the scan benefit, and so do those with severe blockages diagnosed, while those who have moderate artery disease confirmed may only become more anxious after the scan, researchers found.

Computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA), is a high-resolution X-ray of the heart that can be used to diagnose the reason for angina, or chest pain, symptoms and clarify what other treatments might be needed.

“Patients with normal coronary arteries or those with severe coronary artery disease seemed to get the most benefit in quality of life and did best,” senior study author Dr. David E. Newby from University/BHF Center for Cardiovascular Science in Edinburgh, told Reuters Health.

“This suggests that being reassured that all is normal is highly valued by patients and CTCA really helps provide this reassurance. Conversely, knowing the cause of your symptoms is due to coronary heart disease and patients undergo treatment for it, is also very helpful,” he said by email.

Although getting CTCA is associated with a lower likelihood of having a heart attack later on, its effects on symptoms and quality of life may vary, the researchers note in the journal Heart.

Newby and his team assessed how CTCA affected symptoms and quality of life six weeks and six months after the scan for 4,146 patients with suspected angina due to coronary heart disease.

When the CTCA results revealed something less than a blockage, so-called nonobstructive disease, as the cause for the patient’s chest pain, patients’ quality of life got worse in the following weeks and months.

This reflects the fact that the cause of the symptoms had been unknown before and in addition they now have heart artery disease that needs treatment, Newby said.

The findings were similar when it came to changes in symptoms during follow-up. Improvements in symptoms were greatest in patients diagnosed with normal coronary arteries or who had their medications discontinued and least in those with moderate nonobstructive disease or who received new prescriptions.

“Although CTCA removes diagnostic uncertainty and halves the rate of subsequent heart attacks, quality of life can be negatively impacted in those who are worried about their health and are found to have nonobstructive coronary artery disease,” Newby said. “Much like screening tests for cancer, being told you have heart disease does not make the patient feel better,” he added.

If a doctor is faced with a patient who is already on an aspirin and statin with an unconfirmed and questionable clinical diagnosis of angina due to coronary heart disease, he said, then CTCA would be useful because finding normal heart anatomy means that more invasive testing can be avoided, treatment could be stopped and quality of life improved.

“If, however, a patient presents with atypical symptoms and is on no therapy, then the clinician needs to discuss with the patient the implications of potential CTCA findings, including nonobstructive disease that would mandate life-long preventative therapy,” Newby said. “Certainly, this is something we now discuss in more detail with our patients, some of whom have declined CTCA.”

“It was striking for me that health status was very much related to receiving a (treatable) diagnosis or excluding such a diagnosis, rather than experiencing angina symptoms per se,” said Dr. Paula M. C. Mommersteeg from the Center of Research on Psychology in Somatic Diseases, Tilburg University, The Netherlands, who has investigated associations between personality traits and coronary artery disease symptoms.

“In my opinion, CTCA does have added value in the diagnostic process (improved decision making), it is less invasive than coronary angiography (CAG), and can provide more clarity in the cardiac symptoms experienced by patients,” Mommersteeg concluded.

"Exercising by doing interval training, not weight lifting, could be the secret to staying young, according to a new study published Tuesday in the medical journal ""Cell Metabolism.""

High-intensity aerobic interval training--or exercising in bursts of moderate and high-intensity running, cycling, or other aerobic activity--may help to reduce the effects of aging at a cellular level, researchers found.

Scientists analyzed three groups of people who were exercising by doing high-intensity aerobic interval training, resistance training, or a combination of the two, over the course of a 12-week period.

While scientists found that all three types of exercise improved participants' lean body mass, at a cellular level, they found that the group participating in the high intensity interval training also saw improvements in the exercise capacity of their muscle's mitochondria. As people age, their mitochondria, which are responsible for producing energy for your cells, become less efficient.

High intensity interval training essentially ""reversed"" many ""age-related differences"" in aspects of elderly participants' mitochondria, the researchers wrote in the study's summary.

Dr. Richard Besser, ABC News' chief health and medical editor, called the study's findings ""very interesting.""

""When they looked at the cellular level, the changes they saw in the older people’s cells with the high-intensity [training] made those cells look more like younger people’s cells in terms of how they handled energy,” Besser said today on ""Good Morning America."" “That was very interesting.”

Chris Powell, trainer and transformation specialist on ABC's “Extreme Weight Loss,"" said the term high-intensity interval training can be ""terrifying"" to people, but it should not be.

""High intensity interval training is just aerobic training with short bouts of weight training in between,"" Powell said today on ""GMA."" ""The beauty of it though is that we get to control the throttle of our own workouts.""

He continued, ""It doesn’t matter if you’re an elite athlete or you haven’t moved for 10 years...It’s all about completing, not competing.""

Besser advised people to consult with their medical doctor before beginning any new exercise regimen, including high-intensity interval training.

This training, also known as HIIT, can be done using just your own body weight and with minimal to no equipment, according to Powell.

Aerobic training can be accomplished by jump roping, running in place or doing jumping jacks or high knees, the trainer said. Weight training can be done with exercises such as push ups, lunges and back squats.

Powell demonstrated a HIIT workout of 20 high knees combined with 10 back lunges.

""It’s that simple,"" he said. ""There’s a million different combinations. You can do it so many different ways."""

"Eating More — Or Less — Of 10 Foods May Cut Risk Of Early Death

Enlarge this image toggle caption Paul Taylor/Getty Images Paul Taylor/Getty Images

About half of all U.S. deaths from heart disease, stroke and Type 2 diabetes are linked to poor diets, according to a new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

And eating more — or less — of just 10 types of food can help raise or lower the risk of death from these causes, the researchers found.

Scientists at Tufts University identified the foods that seem to contribute the most to the risk. At the top of the list? Salt. Consuming too much salt was associated with 9.5 percent of the deaths.

Next — and I sympathize with all of you who love to eat these — high intake of red meat and processed meats such as bacon was linked to 8 percent of the deaths. And sugary drinks were a factor in 7.4 percent of the deaths.

We know, it may be tough to cut back on foods you love. Bacon is so alluring to many that it has even been called the 'gateway' to meat for vegetarians!

But, here's the flip side: The researchers also found there's a significant risk in eating too little of certain healthy foods. So, think of it this way: You can start consuming more of the foods that are protective.

For instance, the study found that low consumption of nuts and seeds was linked to about 9 percent of deaths.

In addition, diets low in seafood, whole grains and fruits and vegetables were found to contribute to about 6-8 percent of the deaths.

""The good news is that we now understand which foods we need to target to prevent Americans from dying prematurely from cardiometabolic diseases,"" says lead study author Renata Micha, a public health nutritionist and epidemiologist at the Friedman School at Tufts University.

In 2012, about 700,000 Americans died from these diseases. Diet was linked to nearly 319,000 of these deaths. ""This is a remarkable burden, nearly 1,000 deaths each day"" linked to dietary habits, says senior study author Dariush Mozaffarian, dean of the Friedman School at Tufts.

So, changing Americans dietary habits could have a significant impact, the authors argue. ""Our research suggests that nearly half of the risk can be reduced [by] eating a healthy diet,"" Mozaffarian says.

The new analysis is based on data from the federal survey known as NHANES, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Researchers asked some 8,500 participants about their eating habits. In addition, Mozaffarian and his colleagues estimated associations of diet and disease from prior studies and clinical trials.

Now, the task of estimating death or disease linked to diet is tricky. Scientists use statistical methods to try to tease apart the impact of diet as part of people's overall lifestyle.

One challenge: People who have healthy diets often have other healthy habits, too — such as getting regular exercise. Dietary habits also track with socio-economic status. So, people with lower incomes are more likely to have poorer diets compared with wealthier people.

The Tufts researchers used studies that had controlled for these lifestyle factors, but it's not a perfect science.

""Relying on evidence from observational studies...carries the potential limitation of confounding bias,"" states an editorial that was published alongside the study. The editorial raises the possibility that the effect of confounding factors such as socioeconomic status and physical activity could be substantial. ""For instance, it's possible that processed meat consumption merely reflects a Westernized dietary pattern.""

Mozaffarian acknowledges the limitations. ""At the end of the day, our findings might modestly over - or under-estimate the health burdens,"" he told us.

He says the bigger point is this: ""Whether poor diet is causing 1,000 cardiovascular and diabetes deaths per day, or 500, it remains among the leading causes of preventable suffering.""

Poor diets are also linked to billions of dollars in healthcare spending. For instance, diabetes costs the U.S. $245 billion a year. In the U.S., a women with diabetes incurs, on average, about $283,000 in lifetime health care costs. (Many cost studies don't separate Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.)

If you love foods that are associated with cardiovascular risks, you don't have to give them up entirely. As most nutrition studies show, it's excessive consumption that drives up the risk.

For instance, dietary guidelines recommend limiting sugar consumption to no more than 10 percent of daily calories. This means that a single 200-calorie sugary drink may be OK for a person who typically consumes a 2,000 calorie-per-day diet.

The problem: Most Americans consume much more."	Eating More — Or Less — Of 10 Foods May Cut Risk Of Early Death	2017-03-11 06:00:00	http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2017/03/11/519443324/eating-more-or-less-of-10-foods-may-cut-risk-of-death-from-heart-disease	story_reviews_00272	true
"‘‘To new moms: (SUID) was one of my biggest fears and then it happened,’’ said 35-year-old Chauntia Williams, of Maple Heights, Ohio.

Parents are beginning to take baby boxes home from hospitals along with their newborns. A Los Angeles-based company has partnered with health officials to give the boxes away for free and an online initiative offers advice aimed at reducing sudden unexpected infant deaths. New Jersey and Ohio were the first to participate statewide in the program.

TRENTON, N.J. — Cardboard boxes certainly aren’t new technology. But when they’re linked to a practice that started in Finland decades ago to help babies sleep safely, they’re taking on a new purpose as so-called baby boxes make their way to the U.S.

Williams is an advocate for safe sleeping and the boxes after she unexpectedly lost her 33-day-old daughter Aaliyah nine years ago. Williams said her daughter went to sleep in a crib with cushiony bumpers, stuffed animals and an added blanket beneath the fitted sheet and never woke up. She said the coroner determined the bedding caused the death.

She now uses a box with her son, Bryce, though he’s getting a little too big for it. Her message to new parents: Educate yourselves on safe sleep habits.

‘‘Open your mouth and say I’m concerned about this so you can get the assistance,’’ Williams said.

Sudden unexpected infant death is a broad category that includes sudden infant death syndrome and accidental suffocation and strangulation that could come from overcrowded bassinets or cribs. The boxes aren’t the only option for safe sleeping, of course, but health officials say they’re a useful part of a broader safe-sleep education program.

Ohio on Wednesday joined New Jersey in offering the cardboard boxes, which double as bassinets, for free. Each box comes filled with a mattress, fitted sheet, onesie and diapers.

The Baby Box Co. is also handing out the boxes in Minneapolis, Phoenix and San Francisco, with the goal of expanding to all 50 states. The for-profit company also operates in Canada, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Baby Box University, Baby Box Co.’s educational platform, maintains a website that coordinates the educational component of the program.

The idea for baby boxes started in Finland in the 1930s, and is tied to a sharp drop in sudden infant deaths, according to Dr. Kathryn McCans, a pediatrician who chairs New Jersey’s Child Fatality and Near Fatality Review Board. The boxes provide a clutter-free sleep space that has been shown to reduce accidental and unexpected deaths, she said.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the U.S. rate of sudden unexpected infant deaths has been declining since the 1990s when public health officials began recommending parents put infants to sleep on their backs. About 3,700 sudden unexpected infant deaths were reported in the country in 2015.

The boxes are a new idea for many Americans.

‘‘The thought of putting the baby in a box, I was like ‘wow that’s weird,’’’ said Dolores Peterson, of Camden, New Jersey, who became a first-time mom recently and was among the first to bring home a box.

Peterson’s daughter, Ariabella, just turned 3 months old. She said the program was eye-opening for how much information she learned about how to prevent sudden unexpected infant death.

"Taking statins the day of a coronary artery bypass operation may significantly improve survival, a study in the Annals of Thoracic Surgery found.

Researchers looked at 3,021 heart surgery patients, most of whom were taking cholesterol-lowering statins. The 1,788 who continued statins up to the day of surgery had a risk of death within 30 days of 1.7 percent, compared with 2.9 percent for 452 who stopped one to three days before surgery, and 3.8 percent for 781 who did not take statins or stopped more than 72 hours before their operations.

The scientists had no data on how long patients had been taking statins, but only on when they stopped. After controlling for many preoperative health and behavioral characteristics, they found that compared with other patients, those who took statins on the day of surgery had a 48 percent reduced risk of dying in the next 30 days.

“We already knew that people on statins before surgery had a decreased risk of death,” said a co-author, Dr. Yi Deng, an assistant professor of anesthesiology at Baylor College of Medicine. “But there’s never before been data saying how harmful stopping shortly before surgery can be. Unless you have some other reason to stop them, you should take statins right up to the morning of surgery.”"	Having Heart Surgery?

Palliative Care Consults for Patients with Advanced Cancers Reduces Hospitalization and Improves Quality of Care

Integration of Palliative Care Improves Many Measures of Quality

Newswise — (NEW YORK — March 15, 2017/Embargoed until March 17, 4:00 pm ET) Cancer patients admitted to the hospital with advanced stages of disease who were referred early to palliative care had decreased health care utilization and increased use of support services following discharge, according to a new study led by researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Published today in the Journal of Oncology Practice, the study also determined that a systemized process of referrals resulted in significant improvements in 30-day readmission rates, hospice referral, and receipt of chemotherapy after discharge in patients with advanced cancers. This is the first study to demonstrate that among advanced cancer patients admitted to an inpatient oncology service, standardized use of triggers for palliative care consultation is associated with substantial improvement on multiple quality measures.

Patients with advanced cancers often have significant symptoms that affect their emotional status, quality of life, and functional ability. The integration of palliative care improves symptom control and decreases unwanted health care use, yet many patients are never offered these services.

“As cancer progresses, patients are often at high risk for physical pain and emotional distress,” said Cardinale B. Smith, MD, MSCR, Associate Professor of Medicine (Hematology and Medical Oncology), and of Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. “Health care utilization is extremely high once cancer progresses, with hospital readmission rates as high as 40 percent and death in the acute care setting ranging from 30-50 percent – both measures of poor-quality cancer care.”

To improve the quality of care, researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine developed standardized criteria or “triggers” for palliative care consultation for patients admitted to the cancer unit at The Mount Sinai Hospital. Patients were eligible for this prospective cohort study if they met one or more eligibility criteria: advanced solid tumor cancer, prior hospitalization within 30 days, hospitalization for more than 7 days, or active symptoms.

“Care for patients with advanced cancer is often characterized by time spent on acute-care hospital wards and intensive care units, or receiving invasive procedures, chemotherapy infusions, and radiographic imaging. Such interventions drive escalating costs and are often directly in conflict with patients’ prior stated wishes,” said Dr. Smith.

Consultation with the palliative care team included establishment of goals of care, advance care plans using standardized communication protocols, transition planning and symptom assessment and treatment using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS). The palliative team was composed of one board certified PC physician, one nurse practitioner, one social worker, a chaplain, and one to two trainees.

“Our results highlight the need to adopt this practice at acute care hospitals across the nation,” said Dr. Smith. “Palliative care involvement helps patients understand their prognosis, establish goals of care, and formulate discharge plans in line with those goals, and this study is the first to confirm the impact of using standardized criteria and automatic palliative care consultation on quality of cancer care.”

Co-authors of the study include Kerin Adelson, MD, Division of Hematology/Oncology at Yale University School of Medicine.

"The study also measured changes in risk scores of developing heart disease and stroke in the next 10 years, diastolic blood pressure, dietary changes, smoking cessation, cholesterol levels excluding the good cholesterol (HDL) and pulse pressure, which is the difference between the higher and lower (diastolic) numbers on the blood pressure reading.

Results showed some gender-based disparities. Women in the treatment group had an average diastolic blood pressure reduction of 6 mmHg while men in the same group had an average 4 mmHg reduction.

“The electronic counseling (e-Counseling) intervention had an effect similar to that of adding an additional blood-pressure-lowering medication,” said Robert P. Nolan, the lead author of the study, a senior scientist at the Peter Munk Cardiac Center at the University Health Network and an associate professor at the University of Toronto.

The randomized, double-blind study included 264 participants with an average age of 58, of whom 58 percent were women. The participants were divided into two groups, one of which received weekly emails with generic information about healthy living that is good for the heart and for reducing high blood pressure, and the other group received weekly emails with links to interactive tools and online multimedia, such as videos of people diagnosed with high blood pressure who made lifestyle changes. These tools were carefully chosen to increase in knowledge about and motivation to maintain a heart-healthy lifestyle.

“In the e-Counseling intervention we tried to replicate the experience of going through face-to-face lifestyle counseling for a year,” Nolan said.

High blood pressure affects 1 in every 3 adults in the United States, according to a fact sheet by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2013, high blood pressure was the major cause behind 360,000 deaths in the United States. Reduction in high blood pressure has added health benefits because it can potentially reduce the likelihood of heart attacks, strokes, chronic heart failure and kidney disease.

Engaging patients in such a way could be a very powerful tool in promoting behavioral change, Nolan said.

“I am so happy to see this on the agenda for three main reasons. In part, most of the studies here today show what to do — not how to achieve it,” said Eric Peterson, a professor at Duke University School of Medicine and an associate editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association, during the conference. “Secondly, we only look at the trade-off between efficacy and safety, but your study is looking more at efficacy and effectiveness and practicality, issues that are also very important. And finally, this is a very real world study.”

AD

The study was received well by the audience. “No one should die of hypertension. The study is very useful in telling and confirming that we should talk to the patients, no matter how we do it,” said Bernard Wong, a cardiologist based in Hong Kong.

One of the caveats of the study was that participants were highly motivated people looking for ways to cope with and decrease their blood pressure. Participants were also largely white and well-educated, with most having a postsecondary education, so the results of the study might not be generalize well to other groups.

"Many Americans would rather take a drug than change their habits to control a persistent ailment. Yet, every medication has side effects, some of which can be worse than the disease they are meant to treat. Drugs considered safe when first marketed can turn out to have hazards, both bothersome and severe, that become apparent only after millions of people take them for a long enough time.

Such is the case with a popular class of drugs called proton pump inhibitors, or P.P.I.s, now used by more than 15 million Americans and many more people worldwide to counter an increasingly common ailment: acid reflux, which many people refer to as heartburn or indigestion.

These medications are now linked to a growing number of complications, ranging in seriousness from nutrient deficiencies, joint pain and infections to bone fractures, heart attacks and dementia. While definitive evidence for most of the risks identified thus far is lacking, consumers plagued by acid reflux would be wise to consider an alternative approach, namely diet and lifestyle changes that can minimize symptoms and even heal damage already done.

Acid reflux is more than just a nuisance. It involves the backward flow of stomach acid into the tissues above it. It results when the lower esophageal sphincter, a ring of muscle between the esophagus and the stomach, fails to close tightly enough to prevent the contents of the stomach from moving up instead of down. Sometimes the upper sphincter, between the esophagus and the throat, malfunctions as well."	Pop a Pill for Heartburn?

"There’s another type of prescription drugs, besides opioid painkillers, that’s involved in thousands of drug overdose deaths in the US every year.

The drugs are benzodiazepines, which are widely known by their brand names Xanax and Valium and commonly prescribed to help treat anxiety. These drugs were involved in nearly 9,000 overdose deaths in 2015, according to federal data. But there’s a catch: Such overdoses seem to be very closely tied to the opioid epidemic, with the majority of benzodiazepine overdose deaths involving both benzodiazepines and opioids.

A new study published in BMJ looked at just how much the concurrent use of these two drugs increases the risk of overdose versus the risk of only using opioids. Drawing on a huge sample of nearly 320,000 patients who were continuously enrolled in private health insurance plans from 2001 and 2013, researchers compared those who were prescribed just opioids versus those who were prescribed both, and what their additional risk of an emergency room visit or inpatient admission was in the period they were prescribed both.

The study found that among all opioid users, concurrent use of benzodiazepines more than doubled the risk of an emergency room or inpatient visit for a drug overdose.

The study also found that eliminating concurrent benzodiazepine and opioid use could reduce the risk for an opioid overdose–related emergency room or inpatient visit by 15 percent. If that reduced risk applies to overdose deaths as well, eliminating concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine use could have prevented up to 2,630 opioid painkiller–related overdose deaths in 2015.

Keith Humphreys, a drug policy expert at Stanford University and one of the authors of the study, said this reveals an underappreciated policy lever for reducing drug overdoses: making sure patients prescribed to opioids aren’t also prescribed to benzodiazepines, and vice versa. “Even if we didn’t change opioid prescribing at all, the data here suggest that we could cut overdoses dramatically just [by] getting prescribers to not put people on a benzodiazepine at the same time,” Humphreys said.

Yet the study suggests the opposite has happened. From 2001 to 2013, co-prescriptions to opioids and benzodiazepines among the studied pool of patients increased from 9 percent to 17 percent — a nearly 89 percent jump.

For some patients, eliminating these co-prescriptions could involve some tough trade-offs. If someone genuinely suffers from pain and anxiety, doctors and patients will need to work out which condition is more important to treat and which one can be treated with alternatives — to avoid a potentially deadly overdose. (Hopefully while keeping in mind that there’s no good scientific evidence that opioids can treat chronic pain, so opioids aren’t the right treatment for chronic pain in the first place.)

There are some caveats to the study. For one, emergency room visits and inpatient admissions for opioid overdoses likely aren’t a perfect one-to-one proxy for overdoses that didn’t involve a trip to a doctor. The study also only looked at legally prescribed opioid painkillers and benzodiazepines, missing the effects of concurrent use of illegally obtained pills or drugs. And since the research relied on patients who were continuously insured throughout the study period, it’s possible the findings don’t exactly apply to people with spottier coverage. (Although sensitivity analyses in the study for people who had lapses in insurance produced similar results.)

Finally, since the study looked at correlation (not causation), it’s possible that it missed some other factor driving up overdose deaths among concurrent benzodiazepine and opioid users — perhaps, for whatever reason, these users may be more likely to misuse their drugs.

Still, it’s well established that benzodiazepine and opioids compound each other’s overdose risk. So it’s not really controversial to conclude that simultaneously using opioids and benzodiazepines dramatically increases the risk of drug overdose — or, conversely, that stopping the concurrent use of these two drugs could reduce the risk of overdose.

Given that the opioid epidemic has quickly turned into the deadliest drug crisis in US history, it’s important — and potentially lifesaving — for doctors and policymakers to at least consider the study’s findings.

"Do this and similar exercises hundreds of times over multiple sessions weekly; continue for months; and, gradually, presbyopia lessens, a number of studies show.

One study also examined functions of the eye itself and found none of these improvements were because of changes in the eye. They’re all in the brain.

Various smartphone apps say they offer this kind of vision-improving training; I used one called GlassesOff, the only one I found that was backed by scientific studies.

Perceptual learning can improve the vision of people who already see quite well and those with other conditions. For example, a study tested the approach in 23 young adults, around age 24. Compared with a control group of 20 young adults, the treatment group increased letter recognition speed. Similar training is an effective component in treating amblyopia, also called “lazy eye,” which is the most frequent cause of vision loss in infants and children, affecting 3 percent of the population. It may also improve vision in those with mild myopia (nearsightedness).

It should be acknowledged that some researchers involved in many of these studies have financial ties to GlassesOff. However, other studies with no commercial links obtained similar results, and several scientists I spoke to, including those without ties to GlassesOff, thought the science behind the app was credible. One study published in Psychological Science trained 16 college-aged adults and 16 older adults (around age 71) with Gabor patch exercises for 1.5 hours per day for seven days. After training, the older adults’ ability to see low-contrast images improved to the level that the college-age ones had before training.

Scientists don’t know exactly how perceptual learning relieves presbyopia, but they have some clues based on how our brain processes visual information."

"AUGUSTA, Ga. (March 9, 2017) - The first year of free lung cancer screening in the Augusta, Georgia area found more than double the rate seen in a previous large, national study as well as a Massachusetts-based screening for this number one cancer killer.

The higher rates, coupled with the majority of cases being found in early, treatable stages, point toward the need for ongoing, accessible free screening in high-risk populations and underserved regions, say researchers at the Georgia Cancer Center at Augusta University. High risk includes those who have smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for two or three decades and, if they've quit smoking, did so less than 15 years ago.

The screening of 264 high-risk individuals within a 150-mile radius of Augusta found 3 percent had lung cancer and 75 percent of those were caught early, said Dr. Carsten Schroeder, thoracic oncology surgeon at the Georgia Cancer Center and Medical College of Georgia at AU. The researchers note that a percentage of the patients presenting at screening had early symptoms, like a persistent cough, so the rate of cancer detection in patients who showed no indication of disease was 2.2 percent, still double the rates of previous studies.

""Lung cancer is still the number one cancer killer in the United States and in our world,"" Schroeder said. ""If we catch it in the early stages, ideally before symptoms surface, we can operate and patients can have an overall survival rate of 90 percent."" Five-year survival rates are closer to 5 percent in more advanced disease.

The pioneering National Lung Screening Trial, which began in 2002 and included 33 largely urban centers, found 292 cases of lung cancer among the 26,722 high-risk individuals screened in the first year, for a rate of 1.1 percent. That study also provided the first broad evidence that low-dose computed tomography, or LDCT, was a more effective screening tool than the traditional chest X-ray. A decade later, the Massachusetts-based Lahey Hospital & Medical Center, on which the Augusta screening was modeled, found a .6 percent prevalence in the first 10 months of screening.

Like the previous experiences, the Augusta area screening that started in 2014, also reiterated the ability of LDCT to find lung cancer early, said Schroeder, corresponding author of the study in Southern Medical Journal.

Six of the eight cases found in the screening were considered potentially curable with surgery. Positive results were communicated directly to the participant's primary care provider; negative results were communicated to primary care docs and participants, along with a reminder for another screening in a year.

Participants, particularly from surrounding, more rural communities, have limited access to health care, Schroeder said. The area's median household income is 27 percent lower than the national average and the poverty level is 67 percent higher, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The Augusta-area experience found generally younger patients, who started smoking earlier in life and had multiple risk factors. Augusta area participants were an average of 60 years old, about half male and female, more than 68 percent were white and nearly 20 percent were black.

""It doesn't matter how old you are, if you have smoked 30 years, you might want to consider a lung-cancer screening,"" Schroeder said, referencing the reality that some adults started smoking as children. Part of his drive to start a screening program in the Augusta area was that, when he relocated here three years ago from the Cleveland area, he found patients were often referred to him with later, less-treatable disease. In the Cleveland area where Schroeder previously practiced as a faculty member at Case Western Reserve University and where access to health care and/or health insurance was more widely available, early lung cancers might even be detected incidentally when patients had CT scans for a variety of other reasons.

Augusta researchers were able to offer free screening by utilizing natural downtime of the combined positive emission tomography, or PET, and computed tomography, or CT, scanner, said Dr. Norman B. Thomson III, chief of general/cardiothoracic radiology in the MCG Department of Radiology and Imaging and study co-author.

The combination technology is often used to visualize other tumor types throughout the body and many patients require an injection of sugar dye, which will be taken up by the tumor but must first circulate for about an hour before the scan is done. That means the machine is staffed at times when it is not able to be fully used for other diagnostic procedures, time that provides a natural window for lung screening using just the CT imaging capability in under five minutes from arrival to exit, Thomson said. More typically, a scan could cost between $100-$250.

In the last decade, CT technology has gotten increasingly adept at picking up early, small nodules, Thomson said. Low radiation doses work well in the lungs, which are mostly filled with air that provides a blank background for nodule surveillance. Thomson notes that means LDCT is also adept at finding things like scar tissue and small inflammatory nodules, that also are more common in the lungs of smokers. Nodules a third of an inch or smaller tend not to be cancer and more solid masses tend to be, Thomson said. They may follow up on smaller nodules in six months, then if the nodule is stable, go back to annual reviews.

And while some lung cancers are super aggressive, screening also may uncover some slow-growing versions that - like some prostate cancers - will not threaten life but need to be treated and/or closely followed once found.

""That's why the acid test for screening is not how many cancers you find or what stage the cancer is,"" Thomson said, rather what screening does to lung cancer death rates. Current evidence definitely supports screening, he said. Also, like lung cancer has been coincidently found in CT scans for other reasons, physicians like Thomson and Schroeder are now incidentally finding cardiovascular disease in their lung cancer screening.

To date about 700 individuals have been screened in the Augusta area and Schroeder is working to expand statewide, hoping to use the state public medical school's extensive campus network that has students learning from physicians at practices and hospitals across Georgia, as a natural base.

""We want to reach as many people as we can as early as we can,"" he said. Also, about half of patients screened continue to smoke so screening might also be a logical point for smoking intervention, Schroeder said.

The original National Lung Screening Trial, orchestrated by the National Cancer Institute and the American College of Radiology, was launched in 2002 and enrolled nearly 54,000 patients nationally. Five-year survival rates were about 70 percent for early cancers and about 5 percent for lung cancer found late.

Following the trial, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, a nonprofit organization of cancer centers that develop guidelines for cancer diagnosis and treatment, along with the United States Preventive Services Task Force, which makes recommendations for preventive medicine, recommended screening high-risk individuals on a slightly broader scale, which the Lahey and Augusta area screening used. The group recommends screening for those age 55-80 with a 30-pack year or greater history who have stopped smoking for 15 years or less and those age 50 or older with a 20-pack year smoking history and an additional risk factor other than secondhand smoke, such as family history of lung cancer or a personal cancer history. A pack year means smoking one pack a day for 30 years, or a variation like two packs daily for 15 years. After 15 years of not smoking, the lung cancer risk tends to diminish but never vanishes. Schroeder would prefer the screening still not stop there.

A total of 398 individuals signed up for the Augusta area screening, 350 qualified and 264 actually had LDCT. More than 80 patients were not screened in the first year, primarily because of socioeconomic and travel limitations that created a six-week backlog.

Ninety percent of lung cancer is related to cigarette smoking, the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms of lung cancer include persistent, intense coughing, shortness of breath, pain in the chest, shoulder or back and changes in the color and/or volume of phlegm or mucus, hoarseness and coughing up blood.

A 2015 survey of smoking by adults by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found about 15 percent of adults in the country smoked, rates for Georgia and adjacent South Carolina were between 16-20 percent. Rates in Massachusetts, where the Lahey screening occurred, are 12.8 to 16.4 percent. Rates were highest in certain demographics. As examples, smoking rates were highest among those without a graduate education degree certificate and lowest among those with a graduate degree; higher among those living below the poverty level versus above it; and higher among some minorities such as American Indians and Alaska Natives, multiple- race individuals and blacks.

Free lung-cancer screening in the Augusta area finds more than double the cancer rate of previous screenings	2017-03-29 06:00:00	https://web.archive.org/web/20170309190548/https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-03/mcog-fls030917.php	news_reviews_00266	true
"Men who filled prescriptions for erectile dysfunction drugs in the years following a heart attack had a substantially lower risk of dying or being hospitalized for heart failure than men who did not use these drugs, according to a study scheduled for presentation at the American College of Cardiology's 66th Annual Scientific Session.

The study, which retrospectively tracked more than 43,000 men for an average of 3.3 years, found that men prescribed phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors--the type of erectile dysfunction drug sold under the names Viagra, Levitra, Cialis and others--after their first heart attack were 33 percent less likely to die from any cause. No survival benefit was seen among men taking alprostadil, another type of erectile dysfunction drug that works through a different mechanism.

""If you have an active sex life after a heart attack, it is probably safe to use PDE5 inhibitors,"" said Daniel Peter Andersson, MD, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher at Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm and the study's lead author. ""This type of erectile dysfunction treatment is beneficial in terms of prognosis, and having an active sex life seems to be a marker for a decreased risk of death.""

The research is based on a Swedish national database of health records that includes all hospitals in Sweden. Researchers analyzed the records of men age 80 years or younger who were hospitalized for a first heart attack between 2007 and 2013. Tracking the men for an average of 3.3 years following this first heart attack, they compared outcomes among those who subsequently filled a prescription for a PDE5 inhibitor or alprostadil to those who did not. Overall just over 7 percent of men were prescribed an erectile dysfunction drug, 92 percent of whom were prescribed a PDE5 inhibitor and 8 percent of whom were prescribed alprostadil.

After adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors including diabetes, heart failure and stroke, those taking PDE5 inhibitors were found to be markedly less likely to die than those taking alprostadil or no erectile dysfunction drugs. Filling more prescriptions for PDE5 inhibitors appeared to be associated with a greater benefit, although Andersson said that trend should be interpreted with caution because the study was not large enough for a definitive dose-response analysis.

In addition to a decreased mortality, men using PDE5 inhibitors or alprostadil were 40 percent less likely to be hospitalized for heart failure compared to those not taking any erectile dysfunction drugs.

Although the results provide evidence that PDE5 inhibitors may benefit heart health, the retrospective study design makes it impossible to ascertain direct cause and effect, Andersson noted. It is possible that using erectile dysfunction drugs simply indicates a more active sex life, which could itself contribute to, or be a marker of, a heart-healthy lifestyle overall.

""We think that if you have an active sex life it's probably an indicator of a healthy lifestyle, especially in the oldest quartile--those 70 to 80 years old,"" Andersson said. ""From the perspective of a doctor, if a patient asks about erectile dysfunction drugs after a heart attack and has no contraindications for PDE5 inhibitors, based on these results you can feel safe about prescribing it.""

Andersson said the results came as a surprise because erectile dysfunction is associated with an increased risk of heart disease in otherwise healthy men. However, previous studies have associated the use of PDE5 inhibitors with a decreased blood pressure in the left ventricle, which reduces the amount of work required to pump blood and therefore could help explain why the drugs might benefit people with heart failure. PDE5 inhibitors were initially developed to treat angina, a type of chest pain that results from constricted arteries.

The researchers also tracked the risk of a subsequent heart attack or cardiac revascularization procedure, such as angioplasty or coronary artery bypass but found the use of erectile dysfunction drugs had no effect on these outcomes.

A limitation of the study is that the researchers did not assess the effects of untreated erectile dysfunction, or conversely, the effect of having an active sex life without taking erectile dysfunction drugs. The researchers also were unable to account for socioeconomic status; as a next step, they are planning a larger study that will include more health records and complete information on marital status, educational level and disposable income. They are also pursuing a separate analysis of outcomes from erectile dysfunction drugs in men with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.

Erectile dysfunction drugs are safe, possibly beneficial after heart attack	2017-03-29 06:00:00	https://web.archive.org/web/20170322080517/https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-03/acoc-edd030617.php	news_reviews_00268	true
"New research indicates that dietary soy products are safe and even beneficial for women diagnosed with breast cancer. Published early online in CANCER, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society, the findings may help resolve controversies over soy's potential link to breast cancer outcomes.

Soy foods are considered among the healthiest for human consumption, but their estrogen-like properties have raised concerns of a potential increased risk of breast cancer. This is because in hormone receptor-positive cancer, the most common form of the disease, there are some concerns that high estrogen levels help cancer cells grow and spread, though this remains controversial.

""Isoflavones--the component of soy that has estrogen-like properties--have been shown to slow the growth of breast cancer cells in laboratory studies, and epidemiological analyses in East Asian women with breast cancer found links between higher isoflavone intake and reduced mortality; however, other research has suggested that the estrogen-like effects of isoflavones may reduce the effectiveness of hormone therapies used to treat breast cancer,"" explained Fang Fang Zhang, MD, PhD, of the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University. ""Because of this disparity, it remains unknown whether isoflavone consumption should be encouraged or avoided for breast cancer patients.""

To provide some clarity, Dr. Zhang and her colleagues looked at the relationship between dietary intake of isoflavones and death from any cause in 6235 American and Canadian women diagnosed with breast cancer. Over a median follow-up of nine years, women with breast cancer who consumed high amounts of isoflavones had a 21 percent lower risk of dying than women who consumed low amounts. This decrease was largely confined to women with hormone receptor-negative tumors and women who were not treated with anti-estrogen therapy such as tamoxifen (which blocks the effects of estrogen). In contrast to some previous research, high levels of isoflavone intake were not associated with greater mortality among women receiving hormonal therapy.

""Based on our results, we do not see a detrimental effect of soy food intake among women who were treated with endocrine therapy,"" said Dr. Zhang. ""For women with hormone receptor-negative breast cancer, soy food products may potentially have a protective effect. Women who did not receive endocrine therapy as a treatment for their breast cancer had a weaker, but still statistically significant, association.""

More than 20 percent of all new breast cancer cases with known estrogen and progesterone receptor status are receptor-negative, and they have poorer survival rates than hormone receptor-positive cases. ""Whether lifestyle factors can improve survival after diagnosis is an important question for women diagnosed with this more aggressive type of breast cancer. Our findings suggest that survival may be better in patients with a higher consumption of isoflavones,"" said senior author Esther John, PhD, of the Cancer Prevention Institute of California. The investigators noted that they examined only naturally occurring dietary isoflavones, not isoflavones from supplements.

How isoflavones from foods interact with breast cancer cells is unclear, but research has shown that they have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic, and other effects that could influence tumor survival and growth.

In an accompanying editorial, Omer Kucuk, MD, of the Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, noted that the United States is the number 1 soy producer in the world and is in a great position to initiate changes in health policy encouraging soy intake. ""We now have evidence that soy foods not only prevent breast cancer but also benefit women who have breast cancer. Therefore, we can recommend women to consume soy foods because of soy's many health benefits,"" he wrote.

"PHILADELPHIA -- Labor is an intensely strenuous activity, with the uterine muscle contracting every few minutes to reposition a baby through the pelvis and down the birth canal. Even low levels of dehydration can seriously compromise normal physiological function, yet recent studies looking at hydration in laboring women via the rates of intravenous (IV) fluid showed conflicting results. By pooling the data of several studies, Thomas Jefferson University researchers showed that a higher rate of IV fluids not only decreased c-section rates, but also shortened the overall length of labor by one hour, as well as shortened the pushing phase. The results were published online as an accepted article in Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica.

""The results are compelling and strongly argue for a change in practice,"" says Vincenzo Berghella, M.D., the Director of Maternal Fetal Medicine and Professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University. ""We have already begun changing practice at Jefferson to give women more fluids in labor, to allow them to have the best chance of delivering vaginally.""

Dr. Berghella and colleagues compiled data from seven small clinical trials that collectively included a total of 1,215 women. Of those, about half (or 593 women) received IV fluids at a rate of 250 milliliters per hour, and the other half (622 women) received fluids at the lower rate of 125 milliliters per hour. General practice in the United States is to administer IV fluids at 125 milliliters per hour during labor.

With the data pooled, the researchers could see a clear difference in outcomes for women in the two groups. Women getting the faster fluid rate (250 milliliters per hour) were less likely to get a cesarean section. The higher fluid rate also reduced the overall time of labor by an average of 64 minutes, and shortened the pushing phase by nearly 3 minutes, on average.

""We've known that it's important for women to stay well hydrated during pregnancy and labor. This study suggests that IV fluids could help women maintain hydration at appropriate levels, reduce the likelihood of c-section, and decrease length of labor,"" says Dr. Berghella. ""Recently, we also showed that letting women eat more liberally in labor, especially in early labor, has benefits including shorter labor, and no identifiable risks.""

Today, approximately one in three births in the United States occurs via c-section, despite an increased attention by national and international obstetric societies on safely reducing the practice. This study and others are providing evidence for changes in obstetric practice that could help safely reduce c-section rates. Drs. Ehsanipoor, Saccone, Seligman, Pierce-Williams, and Ciardulli were the co-investigators with Dr Berghella.

More IV fluids, fewer c-sections	2017-03-29 06:00:00	https://web.archive.org/web/20170315200836/https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-03/tju-mif031517.php	news_reviews_00264	true
"What is the effect of Topical Curcumin Gel for treating burns and scalds? In a recent research paper, published in the open access journal BioDiscovery, Dr. Madalene Heng, Clinical Professor of Dermatology at the David Geffen School of Medicine, stresses that use of topical curcumin gel for treating skin problems, like burns and scalds, is very different, and appears to work more effectively, when compared to taking curcumin tablets by mouth for other conditions.

""Curcumin gel appears to work much better when used on the skin because the gel preparation allows curcumin to penetrate the skin, inhibit phosphorylase kinase and reduce inflammation,"" explains Dr Heng.

In this report, use of curcumin after burns and scalds were found to reduce the severity of the injury, lessen pain and inflammation, and improve healing with less than expected scarring, or even no scarring, of the affected skin. Dr. Heng reports her experience using curcumin gel on such injuries using three examples of patients treated after burns and scalds, and provides a detailed explanation why topical curcumin may work on such injuries.

Curcumin is an ingredient found in the common spice turmeric. Turmeric has been used as a spice for centuries in many Eastern countries and gives well known dishes, such as curry, their typical yellow-gold color. The spice has also been used for cosmetic and medical purposes for just as long in these countries.

In recent years, the medicinal value of curcumin has been the subject of intense scientific studies, with publication numbering in the thousands, looking into the possible beneficial effects of this natural product on many kinds of affliction in humans.

This study published reports that topical curcumin gel applied soon after mild to moderate burns and scalds appears to be remarkably effective in relieving symptoms and improved healing of the affected skin.

""When taken by mouth, curcumin is very poorly absorbed into the body, and may not work as well,"" notes Dr. Heng. ""Nonetheless, our tests have shown that when the substance is used in a topical gel, the effect is notable.""

The author of the study believes that the effectiveness of curcumin gel on the skin - or topical curcumin - is related to its potent anti-inflammatory activity. Based on studies that she has done both in the laboratory and in patients over 25 years, the key to curcumin's effectiveness on burns and scalds is that it is a natural inhibitor of an enzyme called phosphorylase kinase.

This enzyme in humans has many important functions, including its involvement in wound healing. Wound healing is the vital process that enables healing of tissues after injury. The process goes through a sequence of acute and chronic inflammatory events, during which there is redness, swelling, pain and then healing, often with scarring in the case of burns and scalds of the skin. The sequence is started by the release of phosphorylase kinase about 5 mins after injury, which activates over 200 genes that are involved in wound healing.

Dr. Heng uses curcumin gel for burns, scalds and other skin conditions as complementary treatment, in addition to standard treatment usually recommended for such conditions.

"Drinking concentrated blueberry juice improves brain function in older people, according to research by the University of Exeter.

In the study, healthy people aged 65-77 who drank concentrated blueberry juice every day showed improvements in cognitive function, blood flow to the brain and activation of the brain while carrying out cognitive tests.

There was also evidence suggesting improvement in working memory.

Blueberries are rich in flavonoids, which possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.

Dr Joanna Bowtell, head of Sport and Health Sciences at the University of Exeter, said: ""Our cognitive function tends to decline as we get older, but previous research has shown that cognitive function is better preserved in healthy older adults with a diet rich in plant-based foods.

""In this study we have shown that with just 12 weeks of consuming 30ml of concentrated blueberry juice every day, brain blood flow, brain activation and some aspects of working memory were improved in this group of healthy older adults.""

Of the 26 healthy adults in the study, 12 were given concentrated blueberry juice - providing the equivalent of 230g of blueberries - once a day, while 14 received a placebo.

Before and after the 12-week period, participants took a range of cognitive tests while an MRI scanner monitored their brain function and resting brain blood flow was measured.

Compared to the placebo group, those who took the blueberry supplement showed significant increases in brain activity in brain areas related to the tests.

The study excluded anyone who said they consumed more than five portions of fruit and vegetables per day, and all participants were told to stick to their normal diet throughout.

Previous research has shown that risk of dementia is reduced by higher fruit and vegetable intake, and cognitive function is better preserved in healthy older adults with a diet rich in plant-based foods.

Flavonoids, which are abundant in plants, are likely to be an important component in causing these effects.

The new paper, ""Enhanced task-related brain activation and resting perfusion in healthy older adults after chronic blueberry supplementation"", is published in the journal Applied Physiology, Nutrition and Metabolism.

The research was carried out in association with the University of the West of England, and the concentrated blueberry juice (BlueberryActive) and some funding for the study was provided by CherryActive Ltd, which produces cherry, beetroot and blueberry products in concentrate and capsule form.

The study was also supported by the charity BRACE, which raises funds to support dementia research."

"PHILADELPHIA - Pembrolizumab, an antibody drug already used to treat other forms of cancer, can be effective in the treatment of the most common form of mesothelioma, according to a new study led by investigators from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. The study, published this month in The Lancet Oncology, is the first to show a positive impact from checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy drugs on this disease.

Malignant pleural mesothelioma is a rare and aggressive cancer that represents about 90 percent of all malignant mesothelioma cases. It's primarily caused by the inhalation of asbestos, a fiber commonly found in some forms of insulation, vinyl floor tiles, and other material. Tumors form in the pleura, a thin membrane of cells that line the lungs and chest wall. Most patients survive less than a year. This poor prognosis is partially due to the fact that most patients are not diagnosed until they are already at a late stage of the disease. The standard first-line therapy treatment involves chemotherapy, and currently there is no approved second-line therapy.

""There have been a lot of studies looking at different drugs, but researchers have not seen positive results,"" said the study's lead author Evan Alley, MD, PhD, chief of Hematology and Medical Oncology at Penn Presbyterian Hospital. ""But we've found this new class of drugs, checkpoint inhibitors, seems to be more effective than what's been available in the past.""

Checkpoint inhibitors are a class of drugs designed to free the body's immune system to fight back against cancer. Pembrolizumab, in particular, has been used to treat melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and in some cases, head and neck cancers.

Alley and his team presented data from KEYNOTE-028, an ongoing trial involving 13 different research sites in six different countries all looking at the effect of pembrolizumab on patients with advanced malignancies, including malignant pleural mesothelioma. The study evaluated 25 patients with pleural mesothelioma, all of whom were over the age of 18 and had either already been treated with chemotherapy or were unable to receive it. Patients who had already received another checkpoint inhibitor were not included in the study.

Beginning with the first enrollees two years ago, doctors gave each patient a dose of pembrolizumab every two weeks. The tumor reduced in size in 14 of those patients. On average, patients went about six months without their disease progressing, and overall survival was about 18 months. Fourteen patients passed away during the study, while four were still undergoing treatment as of the study's writing.

""Most patients who receive a second-line therapy have a life expectancy of about six or seven months, so to have four patients still ongoing at two years is very encouraging,"" Alley said.

The most common side-effects reported were fatigue, nausea, loss of appetite, and dry mouth.

""One great sign in this study is that none of the patients had to stop treatment because of side-effects,"" Alley said. ""Some had temporary stoppages, but they were able to continue. The drug appears to be well-tolerated.""

There are multiple studies going on right now to confirm these findings, which the authors note is a necessary step before the drug can become a standard second-line therapy. ""This study provides evidence that some patients can have long-term disease control with this drug, which we haven't seen before,"" Alley said. ""We need to better understand what we can do next to make immunotherapy more effective for more patients.""

Alley said there are already plans for trials that will test combination therapies, which will utilize pembrolizumab in conjunction with other treatments. Those studies are expected to launch later this year, including two at Penn.

The study was funded by Merck, which manufactures pembrolizumab. Alley has no personal financial relationship with Merck.

"More than 35 million Americans are trying to quit smoking. Smoking cigarettes causes 480,000 premature deaths each year due mainly to a two-fold risk of cardiovascular disease and a 20-fold risk of lung cancer. In a commentary published in the current issue of the American Journal of Medicine, researchers from the Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine at Florida Atlantic University reassure clinicians and their patients that varenicline, whose brand name is Chantix, is a safe and effective way to achieve smoking cessation and that failure to use this drug has caused preventable heart attacks and deaths from cardiovascular disease.

In 2006, varenicline was approved as a safe and effective means to quit smoking and achieved permanent quit rates of approximately 25 percent. In 2009, however, varenicline received a black box warning by the FDA based on their adverse event reports of neuropsychiatric symptoms like depression and thoughts of suicide.

There were plausible alternative explanations including that nearly half of the subjects had psychiatric histories, 42 percent were taking psychotropic drugs and about 42 percent were suffering from depression. Nonetheless, since then, there has been a 76 percent decline in the number of prescriptions dispensed from a peak of about 2 million in the last quarter of 2007 to about 531,000 in the first quarter of 2014.

In their commentary, the FAU researchers emphasize that, until recently, the totality of randomized evidence on varenicline had been restricted to eight small trials, which did not demonstrate a hazard. The researchers caution that the reliable detection of small to moderate risks and benefits of drug therapies requires cogent data from large-scale randomized trials designed a priori to test the hypothesis.

Such a large randomized trial was recently completed that included both apparently healthy individuals as well as those with severe mental illness. The trial was conducted for 12 weeks on about 8,000 long-term smokers and included equal subgroups of those without as well as with psychiatric disorders. In subjects without psychiatric disorders, those treated with varenicline had less neuropsychiatric symptoms and in subjects without psychiatric disorders there were no increases in these symptoms. Both groups of participants assigned at random to varenicline achieved significantly higher abstinence rates at 12 weeks than those assigned to placebo, nicotine patch or bupropion. Just a few months ago, the FDA removed the black box warning from varenicline.

The commentary was coauthored by Dianna Gaballa, a fourth-year medical student; Joanna Drowos, D.O., M.P.H., an associate professor of integrated medical science and associate chair of the Department of Integrated Medical Science; and Charles H. Hennekens, M.D., Dr.P.H., the first Sir Richard Doll Professor and senior academic advisor to the dean, all in FAU's Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine.

""The existing totality of evidence suggests an urgent need to increase the use of varenicline in the general population as well as in those with serious mental illness who on average die about 20 years earlier than the general population, in part, because their smoking rates may be as high as 75 percent,"" said Hennekens.

Quitting smoking significantly reduces risks of cardiovascular disease beginning within a matter of months and reaching the non-smoker status within a few years, even among older adults. For lung and other cancers, however, reductions do not even begin to emerge for years after quitting and, even after 10 years, quitters achieve death rates only about midway between the continuing smoker and non-smoker.

""For reducing risks of cardiovascular disease it's never too late to quit, but to reduce risks of cancer, it's never too early,"" said Hennekens.

The authors speculate that if use of varenicline had not plummeted by 76 percent following the black box warning in 2009, perhaps 17,000 premature deaths from cardiovascular disease may have been avoided each year during the last few years. Public health efforts and effective cessation treatments including behavioral counseling and medication have resulted in a 14 percent decrease in smoking in the U.S. while the rates are markedly increasing in developing countries.

###

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heart disease is the leading killer among men and women causing approximately 600,000 deaths each year.

Among the numerous honors and recognitions Hennekens has received include the Ochsner Award for reducing premature deaths from cigarettes in 2014. From 1995 to 2005, Science Watch ranked him as the third most widely cited medical researcher in the world and five of the top 20 were his former trainees and/or fellows. In 2012, Science Heroes ranked Hennekens No. 81 in the history of the world for having saved more than 1.1 million lives. In 2016, he was ranked the No. 14 ""Top Scientist in the World"" with an H-index of 173.

"This article is featured in Newsweek's Special Edition: Nature's Remedies—Heal Your Body.

One of the leading causes of disability in the United States isn’t physical—it’s mental. According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA), 15 million adults—approximately 6.7 percent of the population—suffer from major depressive disorder, which is most often treated through a combination of talk therapy and medication. Those who struggle with depression have imbalanced levels of serotonin, which maintains mood, and dopamine, which controls the pleasure and reward zones. The brain’s synapses control how much of these chemicals are released, and drugs like Zoloft effectively prevent the little serotonin being produced from reabsorbing back into the nerve cells from which they were released, resulting in a higher concentration of serotonin. Some pill-averse patients have longed for a natural cure for depression, while others complain that the drugs they’re on aren’t enough. Hope for both groups may have arrived through an unlikely source: magnets. Researchers discovered they can harness the power of magnetism to increase serotonin production and combat depression through a process called Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS).

“Each [symptom of depression] maps onto a given circuit of the brain,” neurologist Alvaro Pascual-Leone told NPR in April 2016 about treating patients using TMS. “The reason why that circuit of the brain is not functioning properly...has to do with a deficit of a certain chemical in the brain. But the point is that if we can identify the circuit that causes the symptoms, we can target that circuit and make it function better through brain stimulation. So, in a sense, [TMS is] not a treatment...for the ultimate cause of the disorder, but it’s an intervention that improves how the patient is able to function.”

PHILIPPE GARO/SCIENCE SOURCE

TMS has a lot in common with a traditional MRI scan. In fact, the only clue TMS treatment contains magnets at all is that patients must remove any jewelry and stow their credit cards (to prevent demagnetization) before treatment. According to Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine’s description of the technique, a coil is fitted to the front of a patient’s head so the electromagnetic pulses can target the prefrontal cortex of the brain, which controls emotion. A physician then tests the machine to see how much power is needed to affect the patient’s reflexes. Once the patient’s thumb involuntarily twitches, the current is strong enough to affect the patient’s brain activity. At this point, specific symptoms can be targeted depending on the patient’s needs.

The biggest drawback to TMS, according to advocates, is the limitations on just who can undergo the treatment. Though it was approved by the FDA in 2008, its use is federally restricted with exemptions only for those with severe depression, autism or Parkinson’s. Even those who are approved to undergo the treatment face another barrier as TMS is not widely covered by health insurance. Its efficacy varies from patient to patient and, like most prescriptions for depression, TMS has its own set of side-effects. The most common, not surprisingly, are headaches. Although one-third of patients have reported experiencing painful scalp sensations and facial twitching, these tend to fade after several treatments.

Despite these setbacks, researchers are optimistic about TMS—and not just as a form of treatment for depression. Experiments treating Parkinson’s and autism, the other two conditions for which TMS is approved, have seen some success among neurologists. More studies will be needed to determine whether this method can be used as a widespread treatment for other brain-related disorders, but if today’s research is any indication, TMS could be a key to improving the lives of Americans suffering from a multitude of disorders.

"(CNN) An aspirin a day may keep the doctor away. It may also reduce your chances of dying from cancer, according to a study on long-term regular aspirin use and different kinds of cancer.

Yin Cao, an instructor in the Medicine, Clinical and Translational Epidemiology Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, presented the information Monday at the American Association for Cancer Research meeting in Washington.

Cao looked at data from over 86,000 women who were part of the Nurses' Health Study between 1980 and 2012 and over 43,000 men who were part of the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study from 1986 to 2012.

Over that 32-year period, over 8,200 women and nearly 4,600 men died of cancer. The risk of death overall was 7% lower for women and 11% for men who took aspirin regularly, compared with those who did not. The risk of dying from cancer was 7% lower for women and 15% lower for men who took aspirin regularly, compared with those who didn't take a regular dose.

The strongest connection was with colorectal cancer: There was a 31% lower risk for women and 30% for men who were among regular aspirin takers, as other studies have showed. But it also lowered women's risk of dying from breast cancer by 11% and men's risk of dying from prostate cancer by 23%. Men's risk of dying from lung cancer was also lower.

""Evidence has been accumulating very rapidly showing aspirin works in reducing cancer and cardiovascular disease mortality,"" Cao said. ""It is good to remember, though, if a person wants to take a low-dose aspirin, especially if a person has had cancer, they will want to have an initial conversation with their doctor first.""

Not everyone can take aspirin, particularly if you are at high risk for ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding. Studies have showed an increased risk of both when taking a daily aspirin, but the benefit does outweigh the risk for most other people.

Rulla Tamimi , the epidemiology chair for the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting, thought the presentation was a beneficial one, particularly since scientists are trying to better understand drugs we may all have in our medicine cabinets.

""There has been a great deal of interest in understanding the possible benefits associated with common drugs,"" Tamimi said in an emailed statement. ""This study found strong evidence that aspirin use may reduce cancer death. The study was well conducted and was able to control for a number of important confounders. Therefore the findings are believed to be very robust, and suggest that aspirin, which is widely available, cheap and has limited toxicity, has the potential to have widespread benefit on cancer mortality for breast, colon, lung and prostate cancer.""

Studies have also found that aspirin can help patients who have had (or are at high risk for) a heart attack or stroke, and of course it is a good drug to relieve pain. Even the ancient Egyptians used the natural form of it for pain relief centuries ago.

In April 2016, the US Preventive Service Task Force said in a final recommendation statement that taking a regular low-dose aspirin a day may prevent colon cancer and cardiovascular disease for adults between 50 and 69 who have a 10% or greater risk of cardiovascular disease or colorectal cancer.

HealthDay Reporter

WEDNESDAY, April 5, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Scientists report another step in the use of stem cells to help treat people with debilitating heart failure.

In an early study of 27 patients, Japanese researchers used patients' own muscle stem cells to create a ""patch"" that was placed on the heart.

Over the next year, the patients generally showed small improvements in their symptoms -- including the ability to walk without becoming breathless and fatigued.

However, experts cautioned that while the results are encouraging, there's a lot of work left ahead before stem cells can be used to treat heart failure.

""They've shown that this approach is feasible,"" said Dr. Eiran Gorodeski, a heart failure specialist at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.

But it's not clear whether the stem-cell tactic was actually effective, said Gorodeski, who was not involved in the study.

That's because the study didn't include a comparison group that did not receive stem cells.

So it's possible, Gorodeski explained, that the ""modest"" symptom improvements would have happened anyway. All of the patients were on standard medications, and some had heart devices implanted.

Stem cells are primitive cells that mature into the various cells that make up the body's tissues. In the past 15 years or so, scientists have tried to use the cells to help repair some of the damage seen in heart failure.

Heart failure is a progressive disease where the heart muscle is too damaged to efficiently pump blood throughout the body. It often arises after a heart attack.

Symptoms of heart failure include fatigue, breathlessness and swelling in the limbs. The condition cannot be cured, although medications and implantable devices can treat the symptoms.

In the new study, the researchers used stem cells from the patients' own thigh muscle to create a patch they placed on the heart.

That's in contrast to many past studies, where researchers have injected stem cells -- often from patients' bone marrow -- into the heart.

The patch tactic could have some advantages, said senior researcher Dr. Yoshiki Sawa, of Osaka University.

He said animal research suggests that cells in sheet form survive for a longer period, compared to injections.

To test the safety of the approach, Sawa's team recruited 27 patients who had debilitating symptoms despite standard heart failure therapies. The scientists extracted stem cells from each patient's thigh muscle, then cultured the cells so that they formed a sheet.

The sheet was placed on each patient's heart.

The tactic appeared safe, the researchers said, and there were signs of symptom improvements over the next six months to a year.

Why would stem cells from the thigh muscle affect the heart? It's not clear, Sawa acknowledged.

The stem cells don't grow into new heart muscle cells. Instead, Sawa explained, they seem to produce chemicals called cytokines that can promote new blood vessel growth in damaged areas of the heart. The theory, he said, is that ""hibernating"" cells in the heart muscle can then function better.

Still, it's too soon to know what the new findings mean, said Gorodeski.

This type of trial, called phase 1, is designed to look at the safety and feasibility of a therapy, Gorodeski said. It takes later-phase trials -- where some patients receive the treatment, and others do not -- to prove that a therapy actually works.

Those trials are underway, Sawa said.

Other studies are further along. Last year, researchers reported on a trial testing infusions of stem cells taken from the bone marrow of patients with severe heart failure.

Patients who received the therapy were less likely to die or be hospitalized over the next year, versus those given standard treatment only. But the study was small, and the stem cells had only a minor impact on patients' heart function.

So it's not clear why the stem-cell patients fared better, Gorodeski said.

For now, he stressed, all stem-cell therapies for heart failure remain experimental.

""There's no cell therapy that we can offer patients right now,"" Gorodeski said.

The message for patients, he added, is that heart failure can be treated, and researchers are looking for ""innovative"" ways to improve that treatment.

The study was published April 5 in the Journal of the American Heart Association.

"""We are encouraged by these data and the potential impact on adults with major depressive disorder. Given our in-depth and extensive clinical trial experience in CNS including depression, we plan to move forward and develop a phase 3 program for a potential new treatment option for patients,"" said David Nicholson, Chief Research and Development Officer, Allergan.

Study Design

This study was a proof of concept Phase II, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-dose cohort parallel group, single treatment study in adults females with moderate to severe Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). 258 patients (with a minimum total score of 18 on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and a score of 4 on the Clinical Global Impressions Scale) were randomized (1:1:2) into three groups receiving either BOTOX® 30 U, BOTOX® 50 U or placebo. As the number of injections differed between the 30 U and the 50 U group, each study site was randomly assigned to only one of the doses and matching placebo. The study took place over 26 weeks with a 2 week screening period and up to 24 weeks post DB treatment. The primary endpoint of the study was change from baseline to week 6 in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score for BOTOX® 30 U vs. placebo and BOTOX® 50 U vs. placebo; and combined BOTOX® 30 U and 50 U vs. combined placebo groups.

"Dr. Maximilian Muenke has a superpower: He can diagnose disease just by looking at a person’s face.

Specifically, he can spot certain genetic disorders that make telltale impressions on facial features.

“Once you’ve done it for a certain amount of years, you walk into a room and it’s like, oh, that child has Williams syndrome,” he said, referring to a genetic disorder that can affect a person’s cognitive abilities and heart.

advertisement

And that’s an incredibly useful skill, even as genetic sequencing becomes more widespread. For one thing, it can be the factor that sends someone to get a genetic test in the first place. For another, people in many parts of the world don’t have access to genetic tests at all.

That’s inspired years of effort to train a computer to do the same thing. Software that analyzes a patient’s face for signs of disease could help clinicians better diagnose and treat people with genetic syndromes.

Some older attempts at facial analysis relied on large, clunky scanners — a tool better suited to a lab, not the field. Now, in the era of smartphones, such efforts have a whole new promise. Face2Gene, a program developed by Boston-based startup FDNA, has a mobile app that clinicians can use to snap photos of their patients and get a list of syndromes they might have.

Meanwhile, Muenke and his colleagues at the NIH last month published an important advance: the ability to diagnose disease in a non-Caucasian face.

It’s a promising preliminary sign. But if facial recognition software is to be widely useful for diagnoses, software developers and geneticists will need to work together to overcome genetics’ systemic blind spots.

Diagnoses vs. probabilities

The algorithms in general work on the same principles: measuring the size of facial features and their placement to detect patterns. They’re both trained on databases of photographs doctors take of their patients. The NIH works with partners around the world to collect their photos; FDNA accepts photos uploaded to Face2Gene.

But they differ in a key way: Whereas the algorithm the NIH uses can predict if someone has a given genetic disorder, the Face2Gene algorithm spits out not diagnoses, but probabilities. The app describes photos as being a certain percent similar to photos of people with one of the 2,000 disorders for which Face2Gene has image data, based on the overall “look” of the face as well as the presence of certain features. However, the app won’t give clinicians a yes or no answer to the question of, “Does my patient have a genetic disorder?”

That’s intentional. Face2Gene is meant to be more like a search engine for diseases — a means to an end.

“We are not a diagnostic tool, and we will never be a diagnostic tool,” said FDNA CEO Dekel Gelbman.

Drawing that bright line between Face2Gene and “a diagnostic tool” allows FDNA to stay compliant with FDA regulations governing mobile medical apps while avoiding some of the regulatory burden associated with smartphone-based diagnostic tools.

Diversity needed

The algorithm the NIH uses — developed by scientists at Children’s National Health System in Washington, D.C., — seems to work pretty well so far: In 129 cases of Down syndrome, it accurately detected the disorder 94 percent of the time. For DiGeorge syndrome, the numbers were even higher: It had a 95 percent accuracy rate across all 156 cases.

Face2Gene declined to provide similar numbers for their technology. “Since Face2Gene is a search and reference informational tool, the terms sensitivity and specificity are difficult to apply to our output,” Gelbman cautioned.

But there’s one big stumbling block for both of them, a problem that has dogged medical genetics for decades: Data for non-white populations is sorely lacking.

“In every single textbook, the ones we had [when I trained] in Germany and the major textbooks here in the US, there are photos of individuals of northern European descent,” Muenke said. “When I told this to my boss, he said there have to be atlases for children from diverse backgrounds. And there aren’t. There just aren’t.” (Today there is that resource, based on Muenke and the NIH’s work.)

So diagnosing diseases from a face alone presents an additional challenge in countries where the majority of the population isn’t of northern European descent, because some facial areas that vary with ethnic background can often overlap with areas that signify a genetic disorder. Eventually, the software will also have to be able to tackle people with mixed ethnic backgrounds, too. “We have thought about it but haven’t gone there yet,” Muenke said.

For example, children with Down syndrome often have flat nasal bridges — as do typically developing African or African-American children. Across different races and ethnicities of children there were only two reliable identifiers that could be used to diagnose Down syndrome — the angles between landmark points on the child’s nose and eye, according to a paper Muenke and Marius Linguraru at Children’s National published with their colleagues earlier this year. All of the other “typical” features weren’t significantly more likely to show up when children were compared to ethnically matched controls.

In fact, using a Caucasian face as a reference can sometimes be the least representative choice. “One of the findings that I’m very interested in [in] our recent study was that the population that we found to be most different from the others, in terms of facial patterns characteristic of DiGeorge syndrome, was the Caucasian population,” Linguraru said.

To continue to fix this problem, both the NIH and Face2Gene need help from more researchers who can upload more patients’ faces — but that’s easier said than done. Confirming a suspected disorder with genetic tests is standard practice today, and there are no genetic labs based in Africa registered in the NIH’s Genetic Testing Registry. Asia and South America are also relatively underserved.

Those numbers also reflect the general patterns of distribution for medical geneticists. “Most practitioners are located in North America and Europe,” Gelbman said. Nigeria, for example, doesn’t have a single medical geneticist in the entire country.

It’s possible that might change, with time and effort. In addition to his work as a researcher, Muenke directs a program that brings health care professionals from developing countries to the US for a month-long crash course in medical genetics. (The program is funded by the NIH’s Fogarty International Center; President Trump eliminated funding for the center in his 2018 “skinny” budget proposal announced in March.)

For now, both algorithms have shown that they can handle a diverse patient set. FDNA scientists published a paper in January showing that their algorithm could better identify Down syndrome after being trained with a more diverse set of faces, and Muenke and Linguraru have also published papers this year demonstrating their algorithm’s ability to identify genetic disorders correctly in children across a variety of ethnic backgrounds.

As both groups work on recruiting more researchers, they are also working to push their tech forward. FDNA is working on establishing partnerships with pharmaceutical companies to start their commercial outreach. In theory, these partnerships could contribute to precision medicine efforts or help companies develop new therapies for rare diseases.

Meanwhile, Linguraru has his eyes on eventual FDA approval for the algorithm the NIH has used. The ultimate goal would be a simple tool that any doctor could use anywhere to get fast results and better diagnose their patients."

"A study released April 12, 2017, suggests restrictions on heart-damaging fats in restaurant food may have helped prevent heart attacks in several New York counties. (Photo: Dima Gavrysh / AP)

Chicago — Local bans on artery-clogging trans fats in restaurant foods led to fewer heart attacks and strokes in several New York counties, a new study suggests.

The study hints at the potential for widespread health benefits from an upcoming nationwide ban, the authors and other experts say. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2015 gave the food industry until next year to eliminate artificial trans fats from American products.

New York City enacted a restaurant ban on the fats in 2007 and several counties in the state did the same. Hospital admissions for heart attacks and strokes in those areas declined 6 percent starting three years after the bans, compared with counties without bans. The results translate to 43 fewer heart attacks and strokes per 100,000 people, said lead author Dr. Eric Brandt, a Yale University cardiology fellow.

His study was published Wednesday in JAMA Cardiology.

Trans fats, also called partially hydrogenated oils, enhance food texture and structure. They were once commonly used to make restaurant fried chicken, French fries, doughnuts and other foods and found in grocery items including cookies, crackers and margarine.

These fats can boost blood levels of unhealthy cholesterol, increasing risks for heart problems. The FDA in 2006 required them to be listed on food labels and the food industry has been switching to healthier oils.

The researchers examined hospital admissions data from 2002 to 2013 in 11 New York counties that adopted bans and in 25 counties that did not. Admissions for heart attacks and strokes declined in all counties, going from more than 800 to less than 700 per 100,000 people, but the drop was steeper in counties that enacted bans.

Alice Lichtenstein, a heart and nutrition specialist at Tufts University’s Boston campus, said the results are encouraging but that other changes could have contributed, such as smoking bans and mandatory calories on menus.

Dr. Mark Creager, former American Heart Association president, said the results echo previous studies “and are consistent with the thinking of most scientists” on potential benefits of these bans.

“Policies such as these when adapted on a nationwide level will be good for our entire population,” said Creager, director of Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center’s heart center in Lebanon, New Hampshire.

(Reuters Health) - - People were less likely to go to the hospital with heart attacks or strokes after several counties in New York State restricted the use of trans fats, according to a new study.

Trans fats raise bad cholesterol, lower good cholesterol and ultimately increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. They’re found naturally in some foods but are often manufactured and added to processed foods to improve taste and texture.

“New York City was progressive and they enacted restrictions on trans fats, but no one looked to see if this made measurable changes to outcomes,” said study lead author Dr. Eric Brandt, of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.

New York City limited the use of trans fats starting in July 2007. The restrictions applied to food purchased outside of stores, such as at restaurants, street vendors and bakeries, in the city’s five counties. Other New York counties took similar actions after New York City’s measure was enacted.

Previous research found that death from cardiovascular disease declined 4.5 percent within a year after counties enacted trans fat restrictions, the researchers write in JAMA Cardiology. No study looked at non-fatal cardiovascular issues like hospitalizations due to heart attacks and strokes, however.

For the new study, the researchers compared data on people hospitalized between 2002 and 2013 for heart attacks or strokes in counties that did or didn’t restrict trans fats.

Altogether they had data on 3.3 million people in 25 counties without trans fat restrictions and 8.4 million people in 11 counties with restrictions.

In 2006, there were 753 hospital admissions for heart attack or stroke per 100,000 people in counties that never enacted restrictions compared to 726 per 100,000 people in counties that put restrictions in place.

While admissions for heart attacks and strokes fell after 2002 in all the counties, the drop was more substantial in those that enacted trans fat restrictions, the authors found.

After three years or more, the combined rate of hospitalizations for heart attacks or strokes was about 6 percent lower in the counties with trans fat regulations.

Admissions for heart attacks were nearly 8 percent lower in counties with restrictions. Similarly, admissions for strokes were about 4 percent lower in counties with restrictions, but that finding could be due to chance.

Brandt told Reuters Health that New York City was also pushing other public health initiatives around the same time. Those included clean air initiatives and showing calorie counts on restaurant menus.

When they removed New York City data to make sure those other factors weren’t driving the findings, the pattern didn’t change.

“We still found the same thing,” Brandt said.

Still, the study can’t say the trans fat restrictions caused fewer admissions in those counties.

Brandt and colleagues write that in 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) removed manufactured trans fats from its list of safe food additives. By 2018, those fats will be nearly eliminated from American diets, they add.

“There has been a lot of looking into whether trans fats are harmful,” said Brandt. “Here we find on a population level when we restrict them, it benefits society by reducing heart attacks and strokes.”

The findings suggest the FDA’s action will lead to health benefits across the country, he added.

"(CNN) Finding ways to fight the flu just got a tad more ribbeting -- that is, if you ask some researchers who have turned their attention to frogs.

A new study suggests that mucus from the skin of certain frogs can be harnessed to obliterate flu viruses.

Some frog mucus contains antimicrobial peptides, which are immune system molecules that can neutralize bacteria, viruses, and fungi.

However, the flu-killing power of such peptides has been demonstrated only under a microscope and in lab mice. More research is needed to determine just how effective a peptide can be in helping humans beat the flu.

""We have identified a potentially new treatment for H1N1 human influenza virus, which is a peptide that comes from the skin of a frog from southern India,"" said Joshy Jacob , an associate professor in the Emory University School of Medicine's microbiology and immunology department, who led the study.

The peptide, named urumin, specifically targets H1 flu viruses, according to the study, published Tuesday in the journal Immunity

""This peptide works by directly killing the virus, and it is specific for all influenza viruses that have a H1 type of hemagglutinin,"" Jacob said.

Hemagglutinin is a spike-shaped protein found on the surface of flu viruses. For the viruses to make you sick, the spikes of hemagglutinin attach to your cells to infect them.

'It makes the virus particle fall apart'

For the study, skin secretions were collected from 15 frogs, of the species Hydrophylax bahuvistara , which are about the size of a tennis ball and brightly colored. Peptides were then gathered from their secretions.

A Hydrophylax bahuvistara frog in its native environment in southern India.

The researchers observed how the peptides interacted with influenza viruses under a microscope and in mice.

""In this paper we screened 32 peptides, and the surprise was that four out of 32 had activity against the virus,"" Jacob said.

""Out of the four, we found one of them (urumin) was non-toxic to human cells,"" he said. ""So, we tested it against viruses that came from the 1930s until the current ones, and it kills all of the H1s. It doesn't touch H3. It's very, very specific.""

Professor Joshy Jacob, in middle, seen with his colleagues David Holthausen (on left) and Song Hee Lee (on right).

The researchers aren't quite sure why urumin only targets H1 viruses, but Jacob said that H1 viruses might be anatomically similar to an amphibian pathogen that the frog mucus is intended to destroy. If there is a similarity, it may explain why H1 viruses are vulnerable to urumin's wrath.

""The frog makes this peptide for its own survival. It never gets influenza,"" Jacob said, adding that the peptide fights the flu virus by destroying an important part of the hemagglutinin.

To explain how the peptide works, Jacob likened hemagglutinin to a billboard sign.

""You have the message and then you have the little stem that holds it up. The message can change but the stem is the same, and this peptide targets the stem of the hemagglutinin, that's why it's very efficient,"" he said.

The urumin peptide could be a novel treatment since it targets the hemagglutinin, unlike current drugs on the market which target other parts of the virus, resulting in less impact, Jacob said.

""It just blows it up. It makes the virus particle fall apart,"" he said.

Gregory Chinchar, a professor in the University of Mississippi Medical Center's department of microbiology and immunology, said that he was surprised that the peptide targeted the hemagglutinin on the flu virus. He was not involved in the new study.

""I don't think people thought that they work that way before,"" Chinchar said about the peptide. ""They thought that they would be more targeted to membranes, but the data looks like they target the H1 protein specifically and that data looks pretty firm.""

The history of 'milking' frog skin

It was first discovered that frogs had a special way of warding off bacteria and other pathogens in ancient Russia, when live Russian Brown frogs were dropped into milk to keep the milk from going sour, according to the American Chemical Society

""The milk stayed good, just like you refrigerated it,"" Jacob said about the age-old Russian practice.

""In 2012, scientists took that particular frog and wanted to know why is it, why do these frogs keep milk fresh? It turned out that when you shock a frog or when you stimulate them or stress them, they secrete these short peptides into their surroundings,"" he said. ""A majority of the peptides were antibacterial and some of them kill the things that make milk go bad.""

Separate studies have also shown that various amphibian and fish antimicrobial peptides play important roles in protecting the animals against invasive pathogens, including viruses.

""Amphibians, especially certain groups of frogs, produce and store large amounts of antimicrobial peptides in specialized granular glands in the skin,"" said Louise Rollins-Smith, associate professor of pathology, microbiology, and immunology at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. ""When the skin is injured or the frog is alarmed, they release large amounts of the peptides to protect the skin.""

Rollins-Smith, who was not involved in the new study, has conducted separate research on whether certain antimicrobial peptides in frogs might hold clues to preventing HIV transmission

""The peptide described in the Immunity report is somewhat unusual because of the apparent specificity,"" Rollins-Smith said about how urumin specifically targets H1 viruses.

""If further studies show that it has a low level of cytotoxicity and it can protect in other animal models of influenza, it could be developed as a potential treatment for influenza,"" she said. Cytoxicity refers to being toxic to cells in the body.

""As an amphibian biologist concerned about the loss of amphibian species around the globe, it is important to note that they may hold important secrets useful for human medicine and they should be preserved,"" she said.

Ferrets are next, then possibly humans

A challenge to possibly using frog mucus as a flu-fighting treatment in humans is figuring out how to get the urumin peptide to attach to flu virus cells in the human body, Jacob said.

In the new study, the peptide was delivered to mice through their noses, where flu viruses were also delivered.

""I need to come up with a strategy to deliver it systemically as well; maybe an injectable, which goes in the bloodstream and kills influenza viruses,"" Jacob mused.

"Up until the Mona Lisa Touch Laser, there has not been a successful non-medication alternative treatment option for vaginal dryness, also known at vulvo-vaginal atrophy, or VVA. Women in menopause or those who cannot take estrogen, including our breast cancer survivors, often suffer in silence when their vagina decides to completely dry up and lose its moist and supple lining, causing disruptive symptoms. It can affect your ability to do everyday activities such as exercise and engage in sexual contact and intercourse due to pain and discomfort.

Symptoms of VVA include dryness, burning, irritation, itching, urinary incontinence and urinary frequency. These symptoms are mainly caused by a condition called vaginal atrophy, which is due to menopause or peri-menopause or occurs after child birth.

Women with VVA report the following:

75 percent of women report vaginal atrophy negatively impacts their lives.

63 percent failed to recognize vaginal atrophy as a chronic condition.

44 percent report they did not consult a gynecologist for finding a solution.

4 percent only recognized the common symptoms of vaginal atrophy.

Estrogen is the best treatment option for VVA since it rehydrates the vagina and restores lubrication and pH balance in the vagina. Unfortunately, this is not always an appropriate option, especially if you have breast cancer or are unable or unwilling to be on estrogen. Other medication options include Osphena, vaginal estrogen, steroid and testosterone creams, and lubrications or moisturizers.

The Mona Lisa Touch Laser Treatment, or MLLT, is one of the newest kids on the block to combat vaginal atrophy. There are other types of vaginal lasers, but they don't have the same track record, Food and Drug Administration support and long-term studies as the MLLT. An Italian-built laser device, the Mona Lisa Touch Laser holds tremendous promise in treating a vagina that has been transformed in menopause or via cancer treatment side effects.

Once you've had a pelvic exam to assure you're an appropriate candidate, a physician trained in the use of the Mona Lisa – which is actually a small vaginal laser – inserts the device into the vagina during three 4-minute sessions, six weeks apart. Many women report positive changes after just the first 4-minute treatment, which involves removing the dried skin inside that vagina, stimulating collagen and blood flow production, and allowing vaginal revival. The end result is a vagina makeover – a new lease on a vagina, if you will – with more elasticity and natural lubrication of the tissue inside the vagina. Although it may sound too good to be true, the results are proving to be a game changer in the way vagina atrophy is being treated – without hormones – which is a relief to many women and their partners.

Mona Lisa is ideal for women who can't take estrogen due to a personal or family history of breast cancer or for those who are unhappy with the side effects associated with hormone replacement therapy. Still, there is a painful part of the procedure: the cost. It runs about $1,000 a session and is most likely not covered by insurance."

"The new study is the latest chapter in an extraordinary, decades-long collaboration among cognitive scientists, brain surgeons and people with severe epilepsy being evaluated for an operation. The preoperative “evaluation” is a fishing expedition of sorts, in which doctors sink an array of electrodes through the top of the skull and wait for a seizure to occur, to see whether it’s operable. Many of the electrodes sit in or near memory areas, and the wait can take weeks in the hospital. Cognitive scientists use this opportunity, with patients’ consent, to present memory tests and take recordings.

This approach — called direct neural recording, and piggybacking entirely on the clinical placement of the electrodes — has become the leading edge of research into the biology of human memory. This study used data from 150 patients, and had 20 collaborators from institutions around the country, including Emory University, the University of Washington, the Mayo Clinic and the University of California, San Francisco.

In a series of experiments, the researchers had patients memorize lists of words and later, after a distraction, asked them to freely recall as many of the words as they could. All the while, the scientists monitored a handful of “hot spots” in the brain which, previous work had shown, were strongly related to memory encoding. Before the stimulation tests, the team determined the precise settings for each patient’s high- and low-functioning states.

Each participant carried out the word-memorization tests repeatedly, with different words every time; some lists were memorized with brain stimulation, and other lists with no stimulation, which served as a control. The authors then examined memory performance based on whether stimulation arrived during low- compared with high-functioning brain states.

The team then statistically analyzed the results and found that people scored slightly higher than usual on words when stimulation arrived during a low or foggy state — and worse, when the pulse arrived in a high state. “The average enhancement effect was about 12 to 13 percent,” Dr. Kahana said. “And when stimulation arrived in a good state, the average was about 15 to 20 percent worse than usual.”

Dr. Doris Greenblatt, a psychiatrist who participated in the trial at Emory, said she sought the surgery because her epilepsy had long caused memory problems. “Each seizure I had tore at the fabric of memory, and it was as if my memories weren’t attached to anything,” Dr. Greenblatt said."	‘Pacemaker’ for the Brain Can Help Memory, Study Finds	2017-04-20 06:00:00	https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/health/brain-memory-dementia-epilepsy-treatments.html	story_reviews_00248	true
"A minimally invasive procedure designed to shrink prostate tissue with a series of nine-second blasts of steam offers men a new treatment for urinary symptoms commonly associated with enlarged prostates.

The procedure, called Rezūm (pronounced “resume”) and developed by NxThera Inc. of Maple Grove, Minn., became widely available in the U.S. in the second half of 2016. Thermal energy in the form of steam is applied to the prostate with a needle. As it cools it releases heat energy into the tissue, killing cells and shrinking the prostate overall by about a third, says Bob Paulson, NxThera’s chief executive.

Some 50% of men over the age of 50 have enlarged prostates, which can produce symptoms such as increased urgency to urinate during the day and frequent urination, which disrupts sleep at night. Sufferers often must choose between surgery or medication, both of which have side effects, including sexual dysfunction.

The NxThera therapy is the second major innovation in recent years for men with enlarged prostates. The other, an implanted device called UroLift, was introduced in the U.S. in 2013 by NeoTract Inc. of Pleasanton, Calif.

After years of little improvement in the minimally invasive treatment of enlarged prostates, men now have two new options “that leave your sexual function intact,” says Claus G. Roehrborn, a professor and chairman of the department of urology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas and a co-author of published studies on both treatments.

Middle ground

Physicians say Rezūm can be used on a wider range of prostate anatomies than the UroLift implant. The procedure, which costs about $2,000 and generally is covered by insurance, can be done in a doctor’s office in just a few minutes. To dull pain, lidocaine may be injected into the prostate, and most doctors will offer a sedative for patients who want one. After the procedure, most patients need to wear a catheter for two or three days but can return to daily activities immediately.

While the results of a two-year clinical trial published by Dr. Roehrborn and colleagues show that Rezūm provides significant relief from symptoms, it isn’t clear how long the improvement will last.

“The durability issue is what’s going to sink or swim this procedure,” says study co-author Kevin T. McVary, chairman and professor of urology at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, in Springfield, Ill. Both minimally invasive options are likely less effective than surgery, Dr. Roehrborn says, because surgery removes the most tissue.

Still, for many men, the steam treatment offers an appealing middle ground between the risk of surgery and the hassle and side effects of taking daily medication, which can cause dizziness and fatigue.

“I tried Flomax for about two years but the side effects were too annoying,” says Stephen Gooding, a 60-year-old utility supervisor from Grayson, Ga., who says the drug made him dizzy and constipated. He had the Rezūm procedure in October, and now “I feel like I did 30 years ago.”

Journal Report Podcast Subscribe to the Journal Report podcast at wsj.com, on iTunes or Google Play Music.

In the two-year study of 197 men, funded by NxThera and published online in the Journal of Urology in December, patients who had the Rezūm procedure showed a significantly greater improvement in symptoms at three months compared with patients who had a sham procedure. At the end of two years, patients treated with Rezūm showed a 51% reduction in urinary symptoms (as measured by a seven-question survey), compared with the beginning of the study.

Over the two years, about 4% of the patients who underwent Rezūm had to have a repeat procedure or surgery to treat their condition. Early in the trial, physicians were new at performing the procedure and didn’t always remove enough tissue, says Cindy Ogden, vice president, clinical affairs at NxThera.

So far, Rezūm appears to spare men sexual side effects. In the surgical procedure known as transurethral resection, 70% to 80% of men generally get a condition called retrograde ejaculation, also called dry orgasm, says Dr. McVary.

In the Rezūm study, about 3% of the patients who underwent the procedure experienced no ejaculatory volume afterward, and 5.3% experienced a decrease in ejaculatory volume, according to data provided by NxThera. Ejaculatory volume can fluctuate over time in men with enlarged prostates, so it isn’t clear the reductions were caused by the procedure, Dr. McVary says. Overall in the study, there was no average change in ejaculatory volume, he adds.

Larger prostates

A major advantage of Rezūm is that it can be done on most types of anatomies. UroLift isn’t approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat the median, or middle lobe of the prostate, which contributes to symptoms in about 10% to 30% of patients, Dr. Roehrborn says.

The FDA hasn’t cleared Rezūm or UroLift for prostates weighing more than 80 grams. So NxThera can’t market its procedure for larger prostates, though doctors can legally use it on such patients if they choose.

Early results in clinical practice on large prostates appear “promising” and a study on prostates up to 150 grams is expected to begin later this year, says Ricardo Gonzalez, a urologist at Texas Medical Center in Houston, who will be a principal investigator on the research. About a quarter of men seeking treatment for prostate-related urinary symptoms have prostates greater than 80 grams, he says.

Business executive Jim Bracke, 69, says that, with just a Tylenol and the lidocaine shot, discomfort from Rezūm’s steam blasts felt no more intense than “warm water spilled on the groin.” He drove himself home after the procedure, and says he’s thrilled that he no longer needs to check out a bathroom the moment he arrives at a restaurant. And as long as he doesn’t overdo it, he adds, “I can have beer, and coffee and chocolate and still sleep through the night.”

"TrueTear™ is a handheld stimulator with daily disposable tips that is inserted into the nasal cavity to induce the production of tears. There have been two clinical studies showing positive safety and effectiveness of the device in the increase of tear production completed with 145 aqueous deficient dry eye adult patients.

""TrueTear™ represents a technological breakthrough for eye care professionals as it delivers an effective, non-invasive and drug-free way to temporarily increase tear production,"" said David Nicholson, Chief R&D Officer, at Allergan. ""As an innovator in eye care, we are continually looking for new products to offer through our portfolio, and TrueTear™ represents the next step forward.""

The new advancement is an addition to Allergan's current eye care portfolio. Last May, Allergan announced positive results from two pivotal trials for TrueTear™ that showed an increase in tear production upon nasal neurostimulation in adults with aqueous tear deficiency.

""In clinical trials, TrueTear™ demonstrated increased tear production upon stimulation of the nasal cavity,"" said John Sheppard, M.D., M.M. Sc., professor of Ophthalmology, Eastern Virginia Medical School and president of Virginia Eye Consultants. ""Interestingly, neurostimulation has been used as an approach for a wide variety of disorders for more than 30 years. TrueTear™ is the first of its kind to provide a temporary increase in tear production in this way.""

About the Studies

Study 1 is a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-masked, multicenter, cross-over trial in which participants used an active device and two control applications. The primary effectiveness endpoint of increased tear production during intranasal application as measured by Schirmer score compared to both controls was met. Study 2 is a prospective, single-arm, multicenter, open-label clinical trial in which participants used TrueTear™ to stimulate tear production for 180 days. The primary effectiveness endpoint of increased tear production as measured by Schirmer score during application of the device compared with basal Schirmer score at Day 180 was met. Secondary endpoints of increased tear production as measured by Schirmer score during application of the device compared with basal Schirmer score at Days 0, 7, 30 and 90 were also met. The direct clinical benefit of temporarily increasing tear production as a therapy for patients with dry eye disease was not assessed as part of these clinical trials. All device-related adverse events were mild in nature. There were no device-related serious adverse events.

"INDIANAPOLIS -- In the first study of its kind, researchers found real-world massage therapy to be an effective treatment for chronic low back pain.

Niki Munk, an assistant professor of health sciences in the School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis and one of the co-first authors of the study, said that the study's findings are important, given the large number of people who suffer low back pain in the U.S.

Low back pain leads all disorders in years lost to disability in the U.S. Most patients improve rapidly, but one-third report persistent back pain, and 15 percent develop chronic low back pain with significant physical limitations.

More than 50 percent of those who participated in the study experienced clinically meaningful improvements in their low back pain with disability, according to Munk.

""The study can give primary care providers the confidence to tell patients with chronic low back pain to try massage, if the patients can afford to do so,"" Munk said. Generally, massage is not covered by insurance, Medicaid or Medicare.

Previous studies of the effectiveness of massage were conducted in controlled research situations. In this study, patients were referred by a physician to a massage therapist. The massage therapist designed and provided a series of 10 massages -- at no cost to the patient -- in a clinical treatment environment, mimicking the experience of people who choose to seek massage therapy in the real world.

The study also looked at different characteristics associated with patients being more likely or less likely to experience clinically meaningful change from massage. Among the study's findings:

Adults in the baby-boom and older generations tended to be much more likely to experience clinically meaningful changes.

Obese patients experienced significant improvements, but those improvements were not retained over time.

Patients who were taking opioids experienced improvements in their pain from disability in some cases but were two times less likely to experience clinically meaningful change compared to those who were not taking opioids.

While the study results are promising, much more work needs to be done, Munk said: ""The fact of the matter is that chronic lower back pain is very complex and often requires a maintenance-type approach versus a short-term intervention option.""

Additional investigation is needed to replicate the results of the initial study and to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of massage therapy, Munk said.

""Massage is an out-of-pocket cost,"" she said. ""Generally, people wonder if it is worth it. Will it pay to provide massage to people for an extended period of time? Will it help avoid back surgeries, for example, that may or may not have great outcomes? These are the types of analyses that we hope will result from this study.""

The study, ""Real-World Massage Therapy Produces Meaningful Effectiveness Signal for Primary Care Patients with Chronic Low Back Pain: Results of a Repeated Measures Cohort Study,"" was published online March 14 in the journal Pain Medicine.

"ORLANDO--A new study finds that a noninvasive electromagnetic brain stimulation technique helps obese people lose weight, partly by changing the composition of their intestinal bacteria--the so-called gut microbiota. Results of the technique, called deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS), will be presented Sunday at ENDO 2017, the Endocrine Society's 99th annual meeting in Orlando, Fla.

This study expands on the researchers' previous finding that dTMS reduced food cravings and induced weight loss in obese individuals. Unlike deep brain stimulation, dTMS does not need an operation or implantation of electrodes. Instead, an electromagnetic coil is placed on the scalp and sends magnetic pulses to stimulate specific deep regions of the brain. Currently approved in the U.S. for treating major depression, dTMS is being studied in some countries for the treatment of other neuropsychiatric disorders, especially addiction.

""We need new safe and effective therapies for obesity,"" said principal investigator Livio Luzi, M.D., professor and head of endocrinology at the IRCCS Policlinico San Donato and the University of Milan in Milan, Italy. ""Despite numerous preventive and therapeutic interventions, none has stopped obesity from reaching epidemic proportions.""

An underlying cause of obesity may be an impaired gut microbiota composition, an imbalance in the complex mix of beneficial and harmful microorganisms that inhabit the digestive tract. Luzi said scientists now know that an impaired gut microbiota can alter the brain's signals for appetite and satiety, or fullness. He and his co-workers studied whether dTMS could improve the gut microbiota composition in obese persons and, if so, by what underlying mechanisms.

In their study, funded by the Italian Ministry of Health, the investigators recruited three men and 11 women, ages 22 to 65, with obesity as shown by a body mass index (BMI) of 30 to 45 kg/m2. They randomly assigned the study subjects to two groups for five weeks to receive 15 sessions--three times per week--of either dTMS (to the insula and prefrontal cortex deep in the brain) or a sham stimulation as a control. Before and at the end of treatment, subjects provided stool samples for microbiota analysis.

The research team also measured blood levels of glucose (sugar), insulin, pituitary gland hormones and neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine. Pituitary hormones play a key role in regulating appetite, and recent research shows that norepinephrine and other neurotransmitters affect microbiota composition, Luzi said.

After five weeks of treatment, subjects receiving dTMS lost more than 3 percent of their body weight and more than 4 percent of their fat--significantly more than controls did, Luzi reported.

Results of the fecal analysis demonstrated that, after five weeks, dTMS-treated subjects had greatly increased quantities of several beneficial bacterial species with anti-inflammatory properties, such as are found in healthy people. The control group, however, had no clinically relevant alterations in their microbiota composition, Luzi said. He also reported that changes in the abundance of other bacterial species correlated with improvement of metabolic and hormonal parameters, including glucose, insulin, several pituitary hormones and norepinephrine.

""These changes suggest a beneficial effect of dTMS on both weight loss and change in microbiota composition,"" Luzi said. ""Our research shows the innovative ability of dTMS in exerting anti-obesity effects through alteration of the gut-brain axis.""

"The common antibiotic doxycycline can disrupt the formation of negative associations in the brain, according to new research from UCL and the University of Zurich.

The study, published in Molecular Psychiatry, was a pre-registered, placebo-controlled, double-blind randomised controlled trial in 76 healthy volunteers.

In the first session, participants were given either doxycycline or a placebo and learnt to associate a certain colour with an electric shock. A week later they were shown the colours again, accompanied by a loud sound but no shocks, and their fear responses were measured.*

The fear response was 60% lower in participants who had doxycycline in the first session compared to those who had the placebo, suggesting that the fear memory was significantly suppressed by the drug. Other cognitive measures including sensory memory and attention were not affected.

""When we talk about reducing fear memory, we are not talking about deleting the memory of what actually happened,"" explains lead author Professor Dominik Bach (UCL Wellcome Centre for Neuroimaging, Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research and University of Zurich Division of Clinical Psychiatry Research). ""The participants may not forget that they received a shock when the screen was red, but they 'forget' to be instinctively scared when they next see a red screen. Learning to fear threats is an important ability for any organism, helping us to avoid dangers such as predators. Over-prediction of threat, however, can cause tremendous suffering and distress in anxiety disorders such as PTSD.""

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a term for a broad range of psychological symptoms that can develop after someone experiences or witnesses a traumatic event. PTSD is caused by an overactive fear memory, and the new research shows that doxycycline can reduce the fear memory response in healthy volunteers.

""We have demonstrated a proof-of-principle for an entirely new treatment strategy for PTSD,"" explains Professor Bach. ""The theory is based on the recent discovery that our brains need proteins outside nerve cells, called matrix enzymes, to form memories. Matrix enzymes are found throughout the body, and their over-activity is involved in certain immune diseases and cancers. To treat such diseases, we already have clinically approved drugs that block these enzymes, including the antibiotic doxycycline, so we wanted to see if they could help to prevent fear memories from forming in the brain. Our results support this theory, opening up an exciting avenue of research that might help us to find treatments for PTSD.

""Using drugs to prevent PTSD would be challenging, since in the real world we don't know when a traumatic event is about to occur. However, there is growing evidence that people's memories and associations can be changed after the event when they experience or imagine similar situations. This is called 'reconsolidation', and we now plan to test the effect of doxycycline on reconsolidation of fear memories. If this is successful, we would hope to apply the technique to more clinically realistic models of PTSD within a few years.""

The work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation, University of Zurich and Wellcome.

*In the first session, participants were given either doxycycline or a placebo and put in front of a computer. The screen would flash either blue or red, and one of the colours was associated with a 50% chance of receiving a painful electric shock. This happened 160 times, with the colours appearing in random order, so that participants learnt to associate the 'bad' colour with the shock.

A week later, under no medication, participants returned to repeat the experiment. This time there were no electric shocks, but a loud sound played after either colour was shown. Participants' fear responses were measured by tracking their eye blinks, as this is an instinctive response to sudden threats. The fear memory response was calculated by subtracting the baseline startle response -- the response to the sound on the 'good' colour - from the response to the sound when the 'bad' colour was showing.

"Learning skills for positive emotions result in less HIV in blood and less anti-depressant use

Positive emotions are possible even with stress of chronic health problems

Men using positive emotion skills learned to cope with their stress, while control group went on anti-depressants

Findings extend to dementia caregivers, women with metastatic breast cancer

CHICAGO --- When individuals recently diagnosed with HIV were coached to practice skills to help them experience positive emotions, the result was less HIV in their blood and lower antidepressant use, reports a new Northwestern Medicine study.

""Even in the midst of this stressful experience of testing positive for HIV, coaching people to feel happy, calm and satisfied -- what we call positive affect -- appears to influence important health outcomes,"" said lead author Judith Moskowitz, professor of medical social sciences and director of research at the Osher Center for Integrative Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.

This is believed to be the first test of a positive emotion intervention in people newly diagnosed with HIV. Based on the study results, the intervention is promising for people in the initial stages of adjustment to any serious chronic illness.

The paper was published recently in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology.

The HIV study is part of a larger body of positive affect research being conducted by Moskowitz. She also is studying the health effects of teaching the skills to individuals with type 2 diabetes, women with metastatic breast cancer and caregivers of dementia patients.

For the HIV study, which was based in San Francisco, 80 participants (primarily men) were taught a set of eight skills over five weekly sessions to help them experience more positive emotions. Another 79 participants were in the control group.

Moskowitz and colleagues designed the tools based on evidence showing these particular skills increase positive emotions. Some of the skills included:

1) Recognizing a positive event each day

2) Savoring that positive event and logging it in a journal or telling someone about it

3) Starting a daily gratitude journal

4) Listing a personal strength each day and noting how you used this strength recently

5) Setting an attainable goal each day and noting your progress

6) Reporting a relatively minor stressor each day, then listing ways in which the event can be positively reappraised. This can lead to increased positive affect in the face of stress

7) Understanding small acts of kindness can have a big impact on positive emotion and practicing a small act of kindness each day

8) Practicing mindfulness with a daily 10-minute breathing exercise, concentrating on the breath

Fifteen months after the interventions, 91 percent of the intervention group had a suppressed viral load compared to 76 percent of the control group. In addition to the potential benefit of a lower viral load on the infected person, there may be public health benefits.

""From a public health perspective, that is potentially huge for prevention of HIV,"" Moskowitz said. ""HIV is less likely to be transmitted with a low viral load. To have a difference like that is amazing.""

The reduced viral load could be because of a stronger immune system, Moskowitz said. Observational studies in people living with HIV have shown positive emotion is related to a higher CD4 count (an indicator of less HIV-related damage to the immune system). Or, the reduced viral load may be the result of participants' better adherence to their antiretroviral drug therapy, which generally leads to a suppressed or undetectable viral load, Moskowitz said.

The positive emotion intervention also improved mental health. At baseline, about 17 percent of the control group and intervention group reported being on antidepressants. Fifteen month later, the intervention group was still at 17 percent but the control group's antidepressant use rose to 35 percent.

""The group that learned coping skills did not increase antidepressant use, whereas overall the control group increased its antidepressant use,"" Moskowitz said. In addition, the intervention group was significantly less likely to have repeating, intrusive thoughts about HIV.

"A SIMPLE eye test could help solve the biggest global cause of irreversible blindness, glaucoma.

In clinical trials, the pioneering diagnostic -- developed by researchers at University College London (UCL) and the Western Eye Hospital -- allowed doctors to see individual nerve cell death in the back of the eye.

Glaucoma affects 60 million people in the world, with 1 in 10 suffering total sight loss in both eyes.

Early detection means doctors can start treatments before sight loss begins. The test also has potential for early diagnosis of other degenerative neurological conditions, including Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and multiple sclerosis.

Results of first clinical trials with glaucoma patients are published today (28/04/17) in the journal BRAIN.

Professor Francesca Cordeiro at UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, who led the research, said: ""Detecting glaucoma early is vital as symptoms are not always obvious. Although detection has been improving, most patients have lost a third of vision by the time they are diagnosed. Now, for the first time, we have been able to show individual cell death and detect the earliest signs of glaucoma. While we cannot cure the disease, our test means treatment can start before symptoms begin. In the future, the test could also be used to diagnose other neurodegenerative diseases.""

Loss of sight in patients with glaucoma is caused by the death of cells in the retina at the back of the eye. This cell death is called apoptosis.

As with other neurodegenerative conditions, more and more nerve cells are lost as the disease progresses.

Professor Philip Bloom, Chief Investigator at Western Eye Hospital, part of Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, added: ""Treatment is much more successful when it is begun in early stages of the disease, when sight loss is minimal. Our developments mean we could diagnose patients 10 years earlier than was previously possible.""

The technique developed is called DARC, which stands for detection of apoptosing retinal cells. It uses a specially developed fluorescent marker which attaches to cell proteins when injected into patients. Sick cells appear as white fluorescent spots during eye examination. UCL Business, the commercialisation company of UCL, holds the patents for the technology.

The examination uses equipment used during routine hospital eye examinations. Researchers hope that eventually it may be possible for opticians to do the tests, enabling even earlier detection of the disease.

The research is funded by Wellcome Trust.

Bethan Hughes, from Wellcome's Innovation team said: ""This innovation has the potential to transform lives for those who suffer loss of sight through glaucoma, and offers hope of a breakthrough in early diagnosis of other neurodegenerative diseases. Loss of sight as you age is an incredibly difficult disability, impacting quality of life and independence.""

Initial clinical trials were carried out on a small number of glaucoma patients and compared with tests on healthy people. The initial clinical trials established the safety of the test for patients.

Further studies will now be carried out to into DARC and how it can be used not only to diagnose and treat glaucoma patients but also for other neurodegenerative conditions.

"Cognitive behavioural therapy has significant positive effects on a mother’s mental health, income, employment and parenting skills even seven years after the birth of the child, according to the first study of its kind.

The international research project into the impact of depression on pregnant mothers and their babies, led by Professor Sonia Bhalotra from the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Essex, could have major implications for public policy.

More than 400 million people worldwide report episodes of depression, at a global cost of around £600bn in 2010. Between 12% and 20% of women in the 35 countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development suffer from perinatal depression, and 20-35% in poorer countries.

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a talking therapy that can help a person manage problems by changing how they think and behave. The NHS website explains that it is “based on the concept that your thoughts, feelings, physical sensations and actions are interconnected, and that negative thoughts and feelings can trap you in a vicious cycle”.

CBT encourages people to see their problems in a more positive way by breaking them down into smaller parts.

While studies have highlighted the short-term benefits of CBT, until now question marks have been raised about whether it can have long-term effects.

The study, one of the largest randomised control trials to be held in the developing world, followed women diagnosed with depression mid-pregnancy in 40 communities in rural Pakistan. Within a year, more than half of the women in a control group (58%) were still depressed, whereas only a quarter of the mothers who had been treated with CBT reported depression.

Returning to the women and their children seven years later, researchers found that the treated mothers were still significantly less likely to be depressed than the control group. The first group were also more likely to be employed and have control over household spending. There were also big improvements in their parenting style.

The study found that women who had least social support such as those who were not living with or near their mother or mother-in-law, benefited most from the therapy intervention, both in the short and long term.

“These findings on the longer-term benefits at seven years post-treatment are really exciting,” Bhalotra said. “This is an important study for the impact on mothers with depression but there are global implications for the treatment of all human beings suffering from depression. We have seen that CBT has changed how many of the treated women live their lives now – their mental health has improved, their financial situation and their empowerment over their lives, and undoubtedly the way they interact with their children.”"	Therapy ‘has long-term benefits for mothers with depression’	2017-04-29 06:00:00	https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/29/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-long-term-benefits-mothers-depression	story_reviews_00242	fake
"Worcester, Mass. - When the standard malaria medications failed to help 18 critically ill patients, the attending physician in a Congo clinic acted under the ""compassionate use"" doctrine and prescribed a not-yet-approved malaria therapy made only from the dried leaves of the Artemisia annua plant. In just five days, all 18 people fully recovered. This small but stunningly successful trial offers hope to address the growing problem of drug-resistant malaria.

Details of the cases are documented in the paper ""Artemisia annua dried leaf tablets treated malaria resistant to ACT and i.v. artesunate: case reports"" by an international team lead by Pamela Weathers, PhD, professor of biology and biotechnology at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), who has pioneered the use of dried leaves of Artemisia annua (DLA) as a malaria therapy.

""To our knowledge, this is the first report of dried-leaf Artemisia annua controlling ACT-resistant malaria in humans,"" the authors of the Phytomedicine paper note, adding that more comprehensive clinical trials on patients with drug-resistant malaria are warranted. ""Successful treatment of all 18 ACT-resistant cases suggests that DLA should be rapidly incorporated into the antimalarial regimen for Africa,"" they added, ""and possibly wherever else ACT resistance has emerged.""

Watch a video about research at WPI related to this study.

The report documents the experiences of 18 patients in the North Kivu province of the Democratic Republic of Congo who showed symptoms of malaria and were originally treated with the recommended medication: artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), which blends artemisinin, a chemical extract from Artemisia annua, with one or more other drugs that attack the malaria parasite in different ways.

The 18 patients, ranging in age from 14 months to 60 years, did not respond to the standard ACT treatment, and all lapsed into severe malaria, defined by symptoms that can include loss of consciousness, respiratory distress, convulsions, and pulmonary edema. One patient, a five-year-old child, became comatose. All were then treated with intravenously administered artesunate, the frontline medication for severe malaria, but again they showed no improvement.

As a last resort, doctors turned to dried-leaf Artemisia (DLA), a therapy developed and extensively studied by Weathers and her team at WPI. After five days of treatment with tablets made from only the dried and powered leaves of Artemisia (which has been prepared and analyzed using methods developed by Weathers and postdoctoral fellow Melissa Towler), all 18 patients fully recovered. Laboratory tests showed they had no parasites remaining in their blood. (Weathers noted more than 100 other drug-resistant patients also have been successfully treated with DLA tablets.)

""These 18 patients were dying,"" Weathers said. ""So to see 100 percent recover, even the child who had lapsed into a coma, was just amazing. It's a small study, but the results are powerful.""

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 212 million people contracted malaria in 2015 and some 429,000 died, with young children and pregnant women being particularly vulnerable. Caused by a mosquito-borne parasite, the illness is reported in nearly 100 countries and threatens nearly half of the world's population. ACT, the current recommended therapy, is expensive to produce and is in short supply in areas hit hardest by the disease. In addition, while the combination therapy is designed to be less prone to the drug resistance that has rendered previous antimalarial agents ineffective, increasingly the malaria parasite is showing signs of resistance to ACT, particularly in Southeast Asia.

Weathers began her research on artemisinin and Artemesia annua (also known as sweet wormwood) more than 25 years ago. In recent years, she has turned her attention to the use of DLA as an alternative to conventional antimalarial drugs. Noting that Artemisia annua, which is classified as a generally regarded as safe (GRAS) herb, has been consumed by humans and used as an herbal therapy for thousands of years, often in the form of a tea, she became intrigued by the potential for using the dried plant, rather than just a chemical extract, as a malaria treatment. A study she published in Photochemistry Reviews in 2011 was the first to demonstrate that dried leaves of the Artemisia annua plant delivers 40 times more artemisinin to the blood than does the drug based on the chemical extract of the plant.

In a paper published in PLOS ONE the following year, Weathers and her team showed that not only does DLA have antimalarial properties, it is more effective in knocking out the parasite and reduced the level of parasite infection more completely in mice. In a 2015 study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the WPI researchers, with colleagues at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, showed that dried Artemisia leaves cured rodents infected with malaria strains that were known to be resistant to artemisinin. And, in an experiment that accelerated the evolution of the malaria parasite by passing it through up to 49 generations of mice, the parasite showed no signs of resistance to DLA.

Weathers says the superior performance of DLA in comparison to ACT, as well as its ability to kill drug-resistant parasites and avoid the resistance trap, itself, is likely due to the synergistic effects of a complex array of phytochemicals contained in the plant's leaves, several of which are also known to have antimalarial properties and others of which may act both to enhance the absorption of artemisinin into the bloodstream and bolster its effectiveness against malaria. In effect, the dried leaves constitute a robust natural combination therapy, one whose benefits far surpass those of ACT and other combination drugs.

""We have done a lot of work to understand the biochemistry of these compounds, which include a number of flavonoids and terpenes, so we can better understand the role they play in the pharmacological activity of the dried leaves,"" Weathers said. ""The more we learn, the more excited we become about the potential for DLA to be the medication of choice for combatting malaria worldwide. Artemisia annua is known to be efficacious against a range of other diseases, including other tropical maladies and certain cancers, so in our lab we are already at work investigating the effectiveness of DLA with other diseases.""

Another advantage of DLA over conventional malaria treatments is its low cost and the relative simplicity of its manufacture, Weathers said. While the processes for manufacturing ACT is costlier and requires a higher degree of expertise, producing DLA tablets can be accomplished with simpler equipment and a modest amount of training. Growing Artemisia annua and producing and testing the tablets, Weathers noted, are ideal local business that can provide jobs in impoverished areas and greatly expand access to antimalarial therapy.

In fact, she has already established a supply chain in Africa that includes growing and harvesting high-producing cultivars in East Africa, along with GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) processing operations in Uganda where the leaves are dried, pulverized, and homogenized, where the powder is compacted into tablets, and where the tablets are tested to verify their dosage. This supply chain helped produce the tablets used to treat the 18 patients in the Democratic Republic of Congo. ""This simple technology can be owned, operated, and distributed by Africans for Africans,"" Weathers said.

"ILC 2017: The study evaluated the use of a direct-acting antiviral treatment in children aged 6 to 11, for whom the standard of care has been pegylated interferon plus ribavirin

April 21, 2017, Amsterdam, The Netherlands: A study presented today that evaluated an investigational dosage of once-daily ledipasvir 45 mg/sofosbuvir 200 mg (LDV/SOF) in children aged six to 11 years infected with the Hepatitis C virus (HCV), found that 99% of children (n=89/90) had undetectable levels of HCV-RNA 12 weeks after treatment. The study, presented at The International Liver Congress™ 2017 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, also showed that the fixed-dose combination of LDV/SOF was well-tolerated, and no patients experienced a serious adverse event considered related to the study drug.

Around 180 million people globally have chronic HCV infection,1 including approximately 15 million people in the EU.2 The prevalence of HCV infection in children varies from 0.05%-0.36% in the United States and Europe and up to 1.8%-5.8% in some developing countries.3 While direct-acting antivirals have been used to treat and cure adult patients with HCV,4-7 until now children have been mainly treated for 24 to 48 weeks with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (RBV), an older treatment which causes severe side effects.8

""Direct-acting antivirals have transformed the treatment of adults with chronic HCV, however, studies of these new therapies in children are required,"" said Dr Karen Murray, University of Washington School of Medicine and Seattle Children's, Seattle, United States, and lead author of the study. ""These data establish the use of the oral direct-acting antivirals as an important treatment option in HCV-infected children aged six to 11 years old.""

This ongoing, open-label study enrolled 90 children aged between six and 11 years with chronic HCV, mostly genotype 1 (n=86). Children with HCV genotype 1 infection received 12 weeks of treatment (n=85) or 24 weeks of treatment if they had cirrhosis and failed prior treatment with pegylated interferon plus RBV (n=1); genotype 3 patients received LDV/SOF plus RBV for 24 weeks (n=2); genotype 4 patients received LDV/SOF for 12 weeks (n=2). Most children were male (59%), white (79%), treatment naïve (80%), and vertically infected (97%). Of the study population, 89/90 achieved a sustained virologic response 12 weeks after treatment (SVR12); one treatment-naïve genotype 1 patient with cirrhosis relapsed. No children discontinued the study due to side effects or had a severe or life-threatening adverse event related to the study drug. The most common side effects reported in 10% or more of patients were headache, fever, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, vomiting, cough, fatigue, sore throat and nausea.

""This study is a breakthrough for the management of children aged six to 11 years old with Hepatitis C, demonstrating that the new DAA regimen is highly efficacious and, more importantly, safe in this group of HCV-infected children"", said Prof Frank Tacke, University Hospital Aachen, Germany, and EASL Governing Board Member.

"Philadelphia, PA, April 18, 2017 - In the past, all forms of metastatic prostate cancer have been considered incurable. In recent years, the FDA has approved six drugs for men with metastatic disease, all of which can increase survival. In a study published in Urology®, researchers demonstrate for the first time that an aggressive combination of systemic therapy (drug treatment) with local therapy (surgery and radiation) directed at both the primary tumor and metastasis can eliminate all detectable disease in selected patients with metastatic prostate cancer.

While the study is only a first step, one-fifth of the patients treated had no detectable disease, with an undetectable prostate-specific-androgen (PSA) and normal blood testosterone, after 20 months. The results suggest that some men who have previously been considered incurable can possibly be cured; investigators also establish a new paradigm for testing various drug combinations in conjunction with local treatment of the prostate to determine which is the best approach (ie, has the highest undetectable disease rate). Such results could not have been achieved with any single therapy alone.

According to lead investigator Howard I. Scher, MD, Chief of the Genitourinary Oncology Service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, ""The sequential use of the three different modalities helped illustrate the role and importance of each in achieving the undetectable PSA with normal testosterone level end point, which represents a 'no-evidence of disease' status."" Longer follow-up is needed to determine whether these patients were in fact cured.

Twenty men with metastatic prostate cancer, five with extra-pelvic lymph nodal disease and 15 with bone with or without nodal disease, were treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), radical surgery that included a retroperitoneal lymph node dissection as needed, and radiation therapy to visible metastatic lesions in bone. ADT was stopped after a minimum of six months if an undetectable PSA was achieved after combined modality therapy. Other patients were treated continuously.

The combined treatment regimen including surgery was well tolerated. Matthew J. O'Shaughnessy, MD, PhD, Urology Service, Department of Surgery, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, commented ""While the role of local therapy in metastatic prostate cancer is still under investigation, aggressive resection of visible disease performed by experienced surgeons was critical to the outcome.""

Of the five patients with extra-pelvic lymph node involvement, four achieved an undetectable PSA after ADT and surgery, while the fifth needed radiation to reach this milestone. However, none achieved the primary end point of undetectable PSA with testosterone recovery at 20 months after initiation of therapy with ADT alone, although one patient had a PSA of <.05 ng/mL with a testosterone level of 47 ng/dL at 39 months.

Of the 15 patients with bone metastases, 14 (93%) reached an undetectable PSA when ADT, surgery, and radiation were used. Ultimately, four (27%) achieved the proposed end point, a PSA of <.05 ng/mL and serum testosterone of >150 ng/dL at 20 months after the start of ADT, which remained undetectable in two patients for 27 and 46 months, respectively.

Commenting on the study, Oliver Sartor, MD, Cancer Research, Department of Medicine and Urology, Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, LA, stated, ""The end point deserves special mention, as the end point of undetectable PSA after testosterone recovery has been previously discussed but rarely studied. The authors proposed that this end point may serve as a first step toward establishing a curative paradigm. Many in the field agree, but note that the longevity of effect is essential to prove the point of curability. Regardless, the movement toward a curative paradigm is much needed and the investigators are to be congratulated for setting forth a paradigm that can be used to assess the possibility of cure in a reasonable period of time.""

""A multimodal treatment strategy for patients who present with disease that is beyond the limits of curability by any single modality enables the evaluation of new approaches in order to prioritize large-scale testing in early stages of advanced disease. The end point also shifts the paradigm from palliation to cure,"" remarked Dr. Scher. It is expected that an upcoming Phase 2 trial will further test this endpoint and combined modality approach.

"New Orleans, LA - Research led by Frank Lau, MD, Assistant Professor of Clinical Surgery at LSU Health New Orleans School of Medicine, has found that long-term breast reduction outcomes can be improved by using techniques that minimally disrupt the lower breast suspensory ligaments. The paper, The Sternum-Nipple Distance is Double the Nipple-Inframammary Fold Distance in Macromastia, is published Ahead-of-Print online in the Annals of Plastic Surgery.

""Breast reduction is one of the most commonly performed plastic surgery procedures. The long-term appearance after reduction is not optimized 50% of the time using standard reduction techniques,"" notes lead author Dr. Frank Lau. ""At LSU Health New Orleans, we offer an improved technique that preserves more of the critical breast anatomy. This study provides an anatomical foundation for why our technique may yield better, longer-lasting results.""

About 50% of patients who undergo the most commonly used breast reduction technique experience pseudoptosis or ""bottoming out"" as a long-term complication. This occurs when breast tissue drops to the lower portion of the breast independent of nipple position.

""We want our patients to have a long-lasting, aesthetically pleasing breast shape,"" says Lau.

Believing that disruption of the lower suspensory ligaments may be a critical factor because they are stronger than the upper sensory ligaments, the researchers conducted a retrospective review of 208 patients who underwent breast reduction surgery from 2008-2015, studying the results in 400 individual breasts. In all patients, only one reduction technique was performed per patient. Ninety-two percent of the 174 reductions performed with the inferior pedicle technique used a Wise pattern incision, which disrupts the lower suspensory ligaments, and 7.5% used a Boston modification of Robertson technique, which preserves the lower suspensory ligaments. Of the 33 superomedial pedicle reductions, 25 (75.8%) used a Wise pattern incision and 8 (24.2%) used a vertical pattern incision.

By measuring the sternal notch-nipple distance and the nipple-inframammary fold distance ( proxies for upper and lower sensory ligament strength, respectively), the study found a differential rate of stretch - for every 1 cm in upper sensory ligament stretch, the lower sensory ligament length increases by 0.45 cm. This relationship strengthens the researchers' hypothesis that the lower pole ligaments stretch at a significantly slower rate than the upper pole ligaments. An anatomic basis for this differential may exist. A horizontal membrane of dense connective tissue originating at the level of the fifth rib that divides the breast into segments at the level of the nipple has been described. This division may signify a transition point in sensory ligament strength. On that basis, the authors recommend that techniques such as the Boston modification of Robertson technique should be preferred by surgeons seeking to avoid pseudoptosis. Other advantages of the Boston modification of Robertson technique include decreased operative time and elimination of the ""triple point,"" the most common site of postoperative incision rupture.

""This study is one of the largest breast anthropometry (measurement) studies ever performed,"" says Lau. ""These results help us provide the best breast reduction outcomes to our patients.""

"If you need a reason to become a dog lover, how about their ability to help protect kids from allergies and obesity?

A new University of Alberta study showed that babies from families with pets--70 per cent of which were dogs--showed higher levels of two types of microbes associated with lower risks of allergic disease and obesity.

But don't rush out to adopt a furry friend just yet.

""There's definitely a critical window of time when gut immunity and microbes co-develop, and when disruptions to the process result in changes to gut immunity,"" said Anita Kozyrskyj, a U of A pediatric epidemiologist and one of the world's leading researchers on gut microbes--microorganisms or bacteria that live in the digestive tracts of humans and animals.

The latest findings from Kozyrskyj and her team's work on fecal samples collected from infants registered in the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development study build on two decades of research that show children who grow up with dogs have lower rates of asthma.

The theory is that exposure to dirt and bacteria early in life--for example, in a dog's fur and on its paws--can create early immunity, though researchers aren't sure whether the effect occurs from bacteria on the furry friends or from human transfer by touching the pets, said Kozyrskyj.

Her team of 12, including study co-author and U of A post-doctoral fellow Hein Min Tun, take the science one step closer to understanding the connection by identifying that exposure to pets in the womb or up to three months after birth increases the abundance of two bacteria, Ruminococcus and Oscillospira, which have been linked with reduced childhood allergies and obesity, respectively.

""The abundance of these two bacteria were increased twofold when there was a pet in the house,"" said Kozyrskyj, adding that the pet exposure was shown to affect the gut microbiome indirectly--from dog to mother to unborn baby--during pregnancy as well as during the first three months of the baby's life. In other words, even if the dog had been given away for adoption just before the woman gave birth, the healthy microbiome exchange could still take place.

The study also showed that the immunity-boosting exchange occurred even in three birth scenarios known for reducing immunity, as shown in Kozyrskyj's previous work: C-section versus vaginal delivery, antibiotics during birth and lack of breastfeeding.

What's more, Kozyrskyj's study suggested that the presence of pets in the house reduced the likelihood of the transmission of vaginal GBS (group B Strep) during birth, which causes pneumonia in newborns and is prevented by giving mothers antibiotics during delivery.

It's far too early to predict how this finding will play out in the future, but Kozyrskyj doesn't rule out the concept of a ""dog in a pill"" as a preventive tool for allergies and obesity.

""It's not far-fetched that the pharmaceutical industry will try to create a supplement of these microbiomes, much like was done with probiotics,"" she said.

"Dry needling may be a viable treatment alternative to cortisone injection for patients with chronic, intermittent pain and tenderness on the outside of the hip, thus avoiding the potentially harmful effects of steroids

Dry needling may be a viable treatment alternative to cortisone injection for patients with chronic, intermittent pain and tenderness on the outside of the hip, thus avoiding the potentially harmful effects of steroids, according to a new study published in the April 2017 issue of the Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy® (JOSPT®).

Researchers at Baylor Scott & White Health in Temple, Texas, found that dry needling, which uses filament needles to stimulate sensitive loci, or trigger points, in the muscles, is as effective as cortisone injection in reducing pain and improving movement problems caused by greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GPTS). GTPS is the current term for what used to be called greater trochanteric or subgluteal bursitis. This study is the first to directly compare these two treatments for the syndrome.

The medical community once thought that a swollen hip bursa--a fluid-filled sac that acts as a gliding surface to reduce friction between moving tissues in this joint--was the source of this hip pain. This conclusion led to the use of steroid injections to the bursa to help decrease swelling and pain. However, evidence now indicates that injuries to the muscles and tendons around the hip are the actual cause of this pain, and that inflammation is often not involved, calling injecting the bursa with a steroid into question.

GTPS is estimated to affect 10% to 25% of the general population. This kind of hip pain has been reported to be more common in women and in patients with coexisting low back pain, osteoarthritis, Iliotibial band tenderness, and obesity. The study demonstrates that patients with GTPS can get similar results from dry needling as from a steroid injection.

""Evidence for dry needling of the hip in lieu of steroid injection is in its infancy,"" acknowledges lead author Kindyle L. Brennan, PT, PhD, with Baylor Scott & White Health. However, ""this study suggests dry needling as an effective alternative to cortisone injection.""

Dr. Brennan adds that, ""The potential detrimental side effects of steroid injection, particularly repeated injections, are of concern for patients and providers alike."" As a result, ""the identification of a comparable treatment alternative with minimal side effects, such as dry needling, offers valuable clinical advantages,"" she says.

Dr. Brennan and her fellow researchers treated 43 patients with GPTS and a total of 50 painful hips. The patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: one group receiving cortisone injection and the other group, dry needling. Treatments were administered over six weeks, and clinical outcomes were collected at the start of the trial and at one, three, and six weeks. The researchers measured pain and function. They also collected information about medication intake for pain in the involved hip, as well as the sex, age, and body mass index of study participants.

The baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. The results showed that cortisone injection did not provide better outcomes than dry needling for either pain or function in patients with GTPS. Both groups experienced a decrease in pain and an improved ability to move and complete daily activities.

Dr. Brennan cautions that while this study uses a larger sample than most, further studies are warranted. In particular, participants were only followed for six weeks; additional studies over longer time periods will be important.

HealthDay Reporter

WEDNESDAY, May 3, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- A new study finds that people with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis who haven't done well on other treatments may find relief with Xeljanz (tofacitinib), a drug currently used to treat arthritis.

Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. It affects about 700,000 Americans, according to the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation (CCF).

The illness causes inflammation, irritation, swelling and sores on the lining of the large intestine. Symptoms include diarrhea with blood or pus and abdominal discomfort, according to CCF.

""There is still a substantial unmet need for new treatments for patients with ulcerative colitis,"" said study lead author Dr. William Sandborn. He is professor of medicine and chief of the division of gastroenterology at the University of California, San Diego.

Xeljanz targets certain proteins involved in the body's inflammatory and immune responses that other so-called biologic drugs don't, the researchers said.

""Treatment with oral tofacitinib is potentially a new treatment option for patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, pending review by the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration],"" Sandborn said.

The study was funded by Pfizer, Inc., the maker of Xeljanz. Sandborn said he has received research grants from the company and served as a consultant for Pfizer.

Whether Xeljanz should be used as a first treatment is still not clear, said Dr. Arun Swaminath, director of the inflammatory bowel disease program at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.

Because Xeljanz comes as a pill, it could have an advantage for patients, Swaminath said. But so far it has only been tried with patients who have not responded to other treatments, he said.

""How it is used in the real world may be different than how it was used in these studies,"" Swaminath said. ""I am not going out on a limb and say this should be the first choice, because we don't have enough data to say that's the way it should be positioned.""

The researchers randomly assigned more than 1,700 people with ulcerative colitis to one of three phase 3 trials.

The first two trials looked at more than 1,100 patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis who had failed with conventional treatment or treatment with newer ""tumor necrosis factor antagonist"" drugs, such as Remicade (infliximab). They received Xeljanz or a placebo twice a day for eight weeks.

In the third trial, nearly 600 patients who responded to Xeljanz were assigned to a maintenance dose (one group with 5 milligrams [mg] and another group with 10 mg) of the drug, or placebo for a year.

In the first trial, nearly 19 percent of the patients taking Xeljanz experienced a remission of their condition in eight weeks. That compared to just 8 percent of patients receiving placebo.

In the second trial, almost 17 percent of those taking Xeljanz had a remission, compared with nearly 4 percent of those taking placebo, the researchers found.

In the third trial, more than 34 percent of patients taking 5 mg of Xeljanz had disease remission after one year. Forty percent of those taking a 10-mg dose of the drug had remission at a year. Only 11 percent of patients on placebo saw a remission.

However, in all of the trials, more patients taking Xeljanz suffered from infections, such as shingles, than those receiving placebo, researchers found.

In addition, five patients taking Xeljanz developed nonmelanoma skin cancer, compared with one patient receiving placebo. Five patients taking the drug experienced heart problems compared with no one on the placebo.

Also, compared with placebo, Xeljanz was associated with an increase in levels of cholesterol.

The report was published May 4 in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Dr. Sonia Friedman is an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. She's also the author of an editorial accompanying the study.

""Tofacitinib is a promising new class of medical therapy that has efficacy in ulcerative colitis. It is an oral, small-molecule drug that is different from current biologic therapies, such as infliximab [Remicade], adalimumab [Humira], golimumab [Simponi] and vedolizumab [Entyvio],"" Friedman said.

An advantage of Xeljanz is that it is a pill. Other biologic drugs are given by infusion or injection. In addition, patients cannot develop antibodies to Xeljanz as they can with other biologic drugs, Friedman said.

""Tofacitinib may be used in the future as rescue therapy from failure of biologics,"" she said. ""Only future studies will determine whether it can be used as initial therapy for ulcerative colitis and what patients it would help the most.""

"Spit Test May Reveal The Severity Of A Child's Concussion

Enlarge this image toggle caption technotr/Getty Images technotr/Getty Images

A little spit may help predict whether a child's concussion symptoms will subside in days or persist for weeks.

A test that measures fragments of genetic material in saliva was nearly 90 percent accurate in identifying children and adolescents whose symptoms persisted for at least a month, a Penn State team told the Pediatric Academic Societies Meeting in San Francisco, Calif. In contrast, a concussion survey commonly used by doctors was right less than 70 percent of the time.

If the experimental test pans out, ""a pediatrician could collect saliva with a swab, send it off to the lab and then be able to call the family the next day,"" says Steven Hicks, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Penn State Hershey. Hicks helped develop the test and consults for a company that hopes to market concussion tests.

A reliable test would help overcome a major obstacle in assessing and treating concussions, which affect more than one million children and adolescents in the U.S. each year. Many of the injuries are related to sports.

In most cases, concussion symptoms last only a few days. But up to 25 percent of young patients ""go on to have these prolonged headaches, fatigue, nausea, and those symptoms can last sometimes one to four months,"" Hicks says.

And, right now, there's no way to know which kids are going to have long-term problems, he says.

""Parents often say that their biggest concern is, 'When is my child going to be back to normal again?' "" Hicks says. ""And that's something we have a very difficult time predicting.""

Hicks and a team of researchers have been looking for an objective test that might help.

They knew that, after a concussion, injured brain cells try to heal themselves. As a part of this process, brain cells release tiny fragments of genetic material called microRNAs. Some of these fragments eventually turn up in blood and even in saliva.

The team did an experiment that involved 50 concussion patients between the ages of 7 and 18.

""When they came to our medical center and received the diagnosis of concussion, we evaluated them with some standard survey-based tools and then we also got a sample of their saliva,"" Hicks says. Most samples were collected about a week after the injury.

The team measured levels of many different microRNAs in the samples, and eventually they identified a handful that let them predict how long symptoms would last. They also identified one microRNA that predicted which children would have a specific concussion symptom: difficulties with memory and problem solving, Hicks says.

A saliva test could greatly improve care for young people who don't have obvious symptoms of a concussion, says Manish Bhomia, an adjunct assistant professor at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md.

""A lot of children get mild concussion and oftentimes it goes ignored,"" he says.

A reliable lab test would help ensure that children who have a head injury don't go back to school, or to the soccer field, before their brain has healed, Bhomia says.

And microRNAs offer a promising way to assess concussions in adults as well as children, says Bhomia, whose research involves a range of ""biomarkers"" for traumatic brain injury.

But saliva may not be the best place to measure microRNAs, Bhomia says. A better option, he says, might be blood samples, which tend to contain greater numbers of the genetic fragments."

"Marijuana appears to improve the memory and learning abilities of old mice. Scientists discovered low doses of its main psychoactive ingredient—cannabinoid THC—can reverse the age-related decline in cognitive abilities, a finding that could lead to scientists figuring out a way of slowing brain aging in humans.

Researchers are increasingly examining THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) for its potential medical benefits. In the U.K., Oxford University recently launched a £10 million ($13 million) program to “identify new medical therapies through research into the molecular, cellular and systems mechanisms of cannabinoids.” Meanwhile, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has now approved several medications derived from THC.

Many scientists are currently looking at its potential use as a treatment for neurological conditions, including multiple sclerosis, epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease.

Subscribe to Newsweek from $1 per week

In a study published in Nature Medicine on Monday, researchers led by Andreas Zimmer, from the University of Bonn, Germany, have shown how THC can provide significant benefits to mice when it comes to age-related cognitive decline.

THC interacts with receptors in the brain’s endocannabinoid system, which is involved in many physiological functions, including pain, mood, memory and appetite. Previous research has also shown activity in the endocannabinoid system declines as we get older, indicating it plays a role in the progression of aging.

To study what effect THC has on the aging brain, scientists gave low doses of THC to mice at three different life stages—two months, 12 months and 18 months. The latter two groups represented mature and old age.

The team carried out three experiments. The first involved a water maze, where mice have to learn and then remember how to navigate their way to the end. In a control group, mature and old mice performed worse than the young group. However, when treated with THC, the older groups improved at the task, while the young mice fared far worse. (The study’s authors noted that this was in “good agreement with the known detrimental effects of THC on cognition in young animals and humans.”

Next, they created a task where mice had to locate a specific object. Older mice treated with THC performed to the same standard as young mice that had not been given the drug. A third test relating to partner recognition also showed THC led to improved memory in mature and older mice. “Together, these results reveal a profound, long-lasting improvement of cognitive performance resulting from a low dose of THC treatment in mature and old animals,” the scientists write.

Further research showed what might cause the improvement, with THC appearing to restore hippocampal gene transcription patterns—activity in the brain relating to memory and learning—to a similar state seen in young mice.

The team argues that while they do not yet know if these findings would be same in humans, it could lead to new treatments to prevent cognitive decline in older people: “Cannabis preparations and THC are used for medicinal purposes,” they write. “They have an excellent safety record and do not produce adverse side-effects when administered at a low dose to older individuals. Thus, chronic, low-dose treatment with THC or cannabis extracts could be a potential strategy to slow down or even to reverse cognitive decline in the elderly.”

Zameel Cader, associate professor in clinical neurosciences at Oxford University, is involved in the institution’s $13 million cannabis research project. Commenting on the Nature Medicine study, he tells Newsweek the paper is “very interesting on a number of levels.”

“First of all there’s clearly growing interest in the potential therapeutic role of cannabinoids and in this particular case THC on various human conditions,” he says. “This paper is addressing a possible role for that compound in memory and cognition, which is relevant to disorders such as Alzheimer’s and other dementias.”

He said that while it is important to remember the study was carried out on mouse models, the differences in the effect of the drug on younger animals versus older animals tells us a lot about our understanding of the differences between old and young brains.

Moving this research forward, however, will be problematic: “Testing in humans is going to be difficult. This is a challenge faced by anyone wanting to develop a therapy for a human disorder such as dementia. Human lifespan is very extensive. So the question would be, when would be the most appropriate time to give these kinds of medications? Over what period of time do you need to evaluate the effects? In humans it could be years before an effect is noticed.”

“Finally, there is the issue surrounding safety. With a cannabinoid like THC, which does have adverse effects in certain individuals, there would be worries about the chronic dosing of this kind of medicine. We would need to assess the safety first before going into seeing whether it would improve cognition."""	Can Marijuana Restore Memory?

"(Reuters Health) - The experimental orphan drug teprotumumab significantly reduces the eye bulging associated with Graves’ disease, according to results of a small trial.

Among the 88 participants with moderate-to-severe disease who were given intravenous infusions of either teprotumumab or a dummy drug every three weeks for eight treatments, 43 percent who got the real drug had a reduction of at least 2 millimeters in eye protrusion by the sixth week compared to 4 percent in the placebo group.

“In virtually all the responders, the changes are frequently what anyone would call dramatic,” said lead study author Dr. Terry Smith of the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor.

The eyes don’t have that bulging appearance, he said, and many of them return to the degree of bulging they had before they got the disease.

“That’s something that we almost never see in someone who’s manifested the degree of disease one needed to have in order to get into the study,” Smith said.

The marked reduction in bulging is similar to that reported after decompression surgery, Smith and his colleagues write in the New England Journal of medicine.

Graves’ disease is the most common cause of overactive thyroid in the United States, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). It is an autoimmune disorder, in which the immune system attacks the thyroid gland.

Certain immune-system signaling molecules also target other tissues in the body, including in the eyes, which causes their bulging appearance, sometimes known as Graves’ eyes. About 30 percent of people with Graves’ disease develop mildly bulging eyes, and 2 to 5 percent develop severe bulge. This eye condition usually lasts one to two years and often improves on its own, according to NIDDK.

Teprotumumab blocks one of these immune signaling molecules, so researchers wanted to see what effect it might have on the eyes of Graves’ patients with moderate to severe bulge.

The study “included some of the worst cases imaginable and we’re now wondering whether the drug might find expanded utility in much-less-severe disease,” Smith told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.

By week 24, the response rate was 69 percent with the drug and 20 percent with placebo. Among those who completed therapy, the rates were 79 percent and 22 percent, respectively.

More people who received the drug had sizeable reductions in disease activity and reductions of 3 mm or more in eye bulge compared to the placebo group, the researchers note.

However, while only 10 percent of patients who received the drug had double vision before the study, that rose to 50 percent by 24 weeks.

High blood sugar was also a key side effect in participants who already had diabetes, the study team notes, but adjusting diabetes medications solved that problem.

The typical treatment for Graves’ eyes is glucocorticoids, which are not always effective and also have side effects, the study team notes.

The drug, also known as RV001 or R1507, has been developed by Genmab and Roche. River Vision Development Corporation licensed the drug from Roche. On Monday, Horizon Pharma announced that it was acquiring River Vision, which paid for the new study.

Smith said FDA approval could come sometime in 2018. Enrollment in a follow-up trial is expected to begin within six weeks.

The duration of response to the autoimmune inflammatory disease, along with the quick response to initial therapy, suggests fewer infusions may be just as effective, “but future studies will sort that out,” Smith said.

The researchers also cautioned that the study only included volunteers with active disease of recent onset so “the potential of teprotumumab in benefiting patients with milder, less active, or stable disease was not assessed.”

SAN FRANCISCO — Tech company developer conferences always feature a wacky demo or three.

But at Build 2017 in Seattle Wednesday, Microsoft went for the waterworks at the conclusion of CEO Satya Nadella's keynote address: it showcased a prototype watch that temporarily eliminated the arm shaking that often plagues those suffering from the neurological disease Parkinson's.

After a speech that both heralded and warned about coming leaps in technological power, Nadella screened a video that told the story of two British Microsoft Research employees, Haiyan Zhang and Nicolas Villa, who developed the tremor-interrupting device for a BBC documentary, The Big Life Fix.

Working with graphic designer and Parkinson's sufferer Emma Lawton, 32, the researchers developed a watch — which they named Emma — that, according to Microsoft, ""vibrates in a distinctive pattern to disrupt the feedback loop between brain and hand.""

The video showed Lawton trying to draw a square with her shaky right hand, and then again, wearing Emma. Watson erupts in tears as she calls her mother to say this is the first time she's been able to write her name in ages.

When the lights went up, Nadella welcomed both Lawton and engineer Zhang on stage, thanking them for showing that thanks ""developers can have impact.""

Emma Watch remains a prototype, Microsoft says, but the developers are working with a neuroscience research team to undertake trials with a small group of Parkinson's sufferers.

The watch works through a combination of sensors and AI (artificial intelligence) techniques to potentially detect and monitor symptoms like tremors, stiffness and instability, among others, according to Microsoft. ""Once these symptoms can be identified and measured, it’s possible to develop technology and devices that help humans manage their symptoms. AI is used to classify the sensor information and elicit real-time responses on small devices like wearables.""

Microsoft stresses that Emma Watch is not a cure for the disease, which afflicts 10 million people. ""Rather, its technology has the potential to help Parkinson’s patients manage symptoms that impede regular functions. The goal of further research is to determine whether Emma Watch could help other people with similar Parkinson’s symptoms.""

"IRVINE, Calif., May 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Proove® Biosciences, Inc. announces a new study validating the accuracy of precision medicine technology to predict prescription opioid abuse. This study, entitled ""Evaluation of a Predictive Algorithm that Detects Aberrant Use of Opioids in an Addiction Treatment Centre"", is published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Addiction Research and Therapy (Impact Factor: 1.4).

Distinguished Fellow American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM), Diplomate American Board of Addiction Medicine and Fellow American College of Preventive Medicine, J. Ramsay Farah, MD, MPH, MRO, CPE, led a research team that showed Proove Opioid Risk® identifies patients at risk for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) with nearly 97% accuracy. This study evaluated 186 patients, comparing 94 Medicaid patients at an addiction treatment facility with confirmed cases of opioid abuse, and 92 healthy patients with no history of opioid use. The receiving operator characteristic (ROC) curve had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.967. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the ""moderate risk"" cut-off score was 98%, while the specificity of the ""high risk"" score was 100%.

FRIDAY, May 12, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Blood thinners are often prescribed to prevent strokes in people with the abnormal heart rhythm known as atrial fibrillation. But a new study suggests these drugs may also help keep dementia at bay.

The researchers said that the key is to start blood thinners, such as warfarin, soon after atrial fibrillation is diagnosed. That's true even for people at low risk of a stroke who wouldn't normally be given blood thinners.

""We found that people who are on warfarin -- the most common blood thinner used to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation -- experienced very low rates of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease,"" said lead researcher Dr. T. Jared Bunch. He's director of heart rhythm research at Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute in Murray, Utah.

Atrial fibrillation is a common heart abnormality that affects nearly 3 million American adults. It causes the heart to beat abnormally or quiver. This causes blood to pool, and then it can clot.

Atrial fibrillation can cause dementia by damaging tiny blood vessels in the brain through repeated tiny clots or small bleeds that people aren't even aware of, Bunch explained.

While many patients are initially given aspirin, Bunch said aspirin's benefit in cutting the risk for dementia is limited, and patients should be started on warfarin or another blood thinner.

Although the study looked at patients taking warfarin (Coumadin), newer drugs -- including rivaroxaban (Xarelto) and apixaban (Eliquis) -- should reduce the risk of dementia even more, Bunch said.

In patients with atrial fibrillation, the risk of stroke is usually measured using the so-called CHADS score, the researchers said. This score assigns points for several risk factors, such as age, high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes and a previous stroke.

A score of zero to one usually means blood thinners aren't needed because the risk for stroke is low. For patients with scores above one, blood thinners are considered necessary, as these patients are judged to be at moderate to high risk, according to the researchers.

In this study, however, the investigators said they found that even a short delay in giving blood thinners to patients at low risk for stroke increases the risk for dementia.

In patients considered at low-risk for stroke, delaying blood-thinning treatment increased the risk for dementia 30 percent. In high-risk patients, a delay increased the risk 136 percent, the researchers reported.

The longer the delay in giving blood thinners, the more the risk for dementia, the researchers said.

For the study, Bunch and his colleagues looked at information from more than 76,000 atrial fibrillation patients who had no history of dementia. The average age of the study participants was 69, and 57 percent were male. The researchers looked at when treatment began: either within 30 days of atrial fibrillation diagnosis, which was considered immediate; or after a year, which was considered delayed.

""Once you are diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, starting stroke-prevention strategies immediately is essential. We shouldn't wait longer than a month to begin treatment,"" Bunch said. ""The delay in treating can be devastating to patients when they start developing mental decline years later,"" he added.

The results of the study were scheduled for presentation Friday at the meeting of the Heart Rhythm Society in Chicago. Findings presented at meetings are generally viewed as preliminary until they've been published in a peer-reviewed journal.

According to Dr. Byron Lee of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), ""There is a growing body of literature supporting the connection between atrial fibrillation and dementia."" Lee is a professor of medicine and director of the electrophysiology laboratories and clinics at UCSF.

""Therefore,"" he said, ""we need to be extremely aggressive in treating atrial fibrillation patients with anticoagulants [blood thinners] when indicated. This study shows that treatment delays of even one month can greatly increase the incidence of cognitive [mental] decline,"" Lee said.

"The question

Millions of people take a low-dose aspirin daily in hopes of reducing their chances of having a heart attack. For women, might aspirin also help prevent breast cancer?

This study

The researchers analyzed data on 57,164 women, most in their early 60s, who had no history of breast cancer. About 23 percent of the women reported taking a low-dose aspirin (81 milligrams), 18 percent took ibuprofen, 11 percent took full-strength aspirin (325 mg) and about 10 percent took a COX-2 inhibitor or another nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). All were taking the medication at least three times a week.

Over seven years, 1,457 women got a breast-cancer diagnosis. Those taking low-dose aspirin were 16 percent less likely to have developed any type of breast cancer, compared with women who took no NSAID. They were 20 percent less likely to have developed the most common type: breast cancer that is hormone-receptor-positive and HER2-negative. The study did not find similar links between regular-dose aspirin or other NSAIDs and the risk for breast cancer.

[Certain adults should take a daily baby aspirin, expert panel says]

Who may be affected?

Women. About 1 of every 8 women in the United States will develop breast cancer at some point. Those who take a daily low-dose aspirin, also called a baby aspirin, usually do so to prevent cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death for women older than 25. Aspirin has been shown to help keep blood from clotting, which can help prevent heart attacks and ischemic stroke (the type caused by a blocked blood vessel in the brain). However, aspirin can increase the risk for internal bleeding, so women should talk with their doctors before starting a low-dose aspirin regimen, for any reason.

Caveats

The researchers suggested that the difference in results between low- and regular-dose aspirin may have been attributable to most women taking low-dose aspirin more often than three times a week, even daily, for cardiovascular protection as opposed to more-sporadic use of regular-dose aspirin for pain relief. Hormone therapy and alcohol use were more prevalent among the participants than normal; both are considered risk factors for breast cancer and may have affected the results. Data on aspirin and other NSAID usage came from the women’s responses on questionnaires. Most of the participants were white.

"(Reuters) - Pivotal trial results for Merck & Co Inc’s immunotherapy drug Keytruda show that it lengthened survival by three months, or nearly 40 percent, for patients with advanced bladder cancer who had stopped responding to chemotherapy.

The data, to be presented next month at a meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, follow last week’s announcement that rival drug Tecentriq, from Roche Holding AG, did not improve survival when used as a second-line treatment for bladder cancer in a trial.

The Merck drug is awaiting U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, but Tecentriq was approved by the agency last year, contingent on verification of its clinical benefit. Roche, in an emailed statement, said it plans to discuss the data with health authorities but did not disclose the timing for the discussions. According to the FDA approval letter, the company has until December to submit the full trial data to the agency.

Merck filed in February for FDA approval of Keytruda for both initial and secondary treatment of advanced urothelial cancer, the most common type of bladder cancer. Keytruda is already approved for treating melanoma, lung cancer, head and neck cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma.

Merck announced in October that the second-line bladder cancer study met its main goal and was stopped early. The company is currently enrolling patients in a phase three trial of Keytruda, combined with chemotherapy, as an initial treatment for bladder cancer.

In addition to Tecentriq’s approval for bladder cancer patients whose disease has stopped responding to chemotherapy, the FDA last month approved the Roche drug as an initial treatment for people with a specific type of advanced bladder cancer and in people whose cancer progressed despite at least one prior platinum-containing chemotherapy.

The agency has also granted contingent approval to AstraZeneca Plc’s Imfinzi, Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo and Bavencio, developed by Pfizer Inc and Merck KGaA, as second-line bladder cancer treatments.

All five drugs are part of a new class of treatments designed to unleash the body’s immune system to fight cancer by interfering with proteins known as PD-1 or PD-L1 that help malignant cells evade immune attack.

Merck said data from an open-label Phase 3 trial of 542 advanced bladder cancer patients showed median survival of 10.3 months for Keytruda patients and 7.4 months for patients given second-line chemotherapy. The study’s median follow-up was 18.5 months.

After 18 months, 36 percent of Keytruda patients were alive, compared with 20.5 percent of chemotherapy patients, according to research published by ASCO.

The study did not detect a difference in the length of time patients lived without their disease getting worse.

Severe side effects were reported in 16.5 percent of the Keytruda patients, compared with nearly half of the chemotherapy group."

HealthDay Reporter

FRIDAY, May 19, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- A leukemia drug might also effectively treat severe asthma, a small-scale clinical trial suggests.

Gleevec (imatinib) reduced the ""twitchiness"" of airways, making them less likely to reflexively constrict when exposed to an allergen or asthma trigger, said senior researcher Dr. Elliot Israel.

""We showed we could decrease the amount of airway twitchiness by a third,"" Israel said. ""That's a substantial change, and that was significant compared with the placebo group.""

Israel is director of the respiratory therapy department at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.

The drug also improved overall airway function, an effect researchers hadn't expected, Israel said.

People whose severe asthma isn't controlled despite use of high-dose steroid medications are at risk of declining lung function and poor quality of life, the researchers said in background notes.

But, this powerful cancer drug can't be recommended for them on the basis of this small study, Israel and other specialists noted.

Gleevec fights leukemia by blocking a specific receptor on cancerous white blood cells, inhibiting their ability to multiply and spread, Israel said.

That same action also affects mast cells, a type of white blood cell distributed throughout the body that promotes inflammation and causes allergic reactions, Israel said.

For example, mast cells in the skin are responsible for hives, while mast cells in the lungs have been associated with severe asthma, he said.

""By blocking the signal that helps keep mast cells alive, we were hoping to reduce the number of these cells,"" Israel said. ""By doing that, we hoped to produce improvements beyond the maximal therapy that these patients with severe asthma are on.""

Israel and his colleagues recruited 62 severe asthma sufferers for the study. All received top-notch asthma treatment, and were randomly assigned to take either Gleevec or a placebo pill once daily during the 6-month trial.

Blood tests showed that Gleevec did reduce mast cell activity in patients, Israel said.

Further, allergy challenge tests showed a decrease in airway reactivity among patients taking Gleevec, the researchers reported. Airways became less likely to close off after exposure to an allergen.

Physical examinations showed that people taking Gleevec actually experienced a slight overall widening of their airways, Israel added.

""There was a small but significant improvement in the airway narrowing in these patients, which we didn't expect because we didn't think the mast cells were necessarily promoting that airway narrowing all the time,"" Israel said.

Side-effects were not as severe as expected, he added. One person dropped out because of a sharp decline in white blood cells, which bounced back after the drug was discontinued. Another person dropped out because of leg cramps associated with the drug.

""All in all, we were expecting a significantly greater pattern of side-effects, and we didn't see it,"" Israel explained.

According to Dr. Len Horovitz, a pulmonary specialist with Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, ""This drug represents a new mechanism for the immune modulation of severe asthma."" Horovitz was not involved with the study.

""It has been a while since a new approach and treatment for severe asthma has emerged,"" Horovitz said. ""Further studies will be needed to assess its utility in moderate asthma.""

Pulmonologist Dr. Theodore Maniatis is medical director of Staten Island University Hospital in New York City. He sounded a more cautionary note.

""This is a very early work that in no way should encourage asthmatics,"" Maniatis said. ""While it is a very interesting study for pulmonologists and immunologists, it is a very small study.""

Until now, ""this immune-modulating drug has been used only for cancer and is toxic,"" he added. ""It will take years of study to determine the usefulness of this drug in treatment.""

Israel agreed that further clinical trials are needed. ""Before you go out and recommend this be used in general, you really want to repeat this in a larger population with greater numbers,"" he said.

It likely will be three to four years before Gleevec could be approved for asthma treatment, Israel estimated.

If proven effective, Gleevec might provide a relatively inexpensive new treatment for asthma patients. Two generic versions of the drug were launched last year, which could make it less pricey than new-wave asthma drugs headed for the market, Israel added.

The study was published May 18 in the New England Journal of Medicine.

"Common blood tests could help diagnose cancer early even in patients that show no other symptoms, study finds

A common blood test could help diagnose cancer earlier, according to research suggesting a high platelet count is strongly associated with the disease.



Platelets are tiny blood cells that circulate in the body, helping wounds to clot. But in some individuals too many platelets are produced – a condition known as thrombocytosis, thought to affect about half a million people in the UK over the age of 40.

Researchers say that raised platelet counts are as good a predictor of getting any cancer as a lump in the breast is for breast cancer.

“This is a clue which can be used in practice by GPs to help them select patients for further investigation … most excitingly in some patients who may not already have other symptoms of cancer to achieve earlier diagnosis,” said Sarah Bailey, co-author of the research from the University of Exeter.

Previous studies have suggested a link between thrombocytosis and various cancers, with recent guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence advising high platelet counts could be a sign of cancer of the oesophageal, stomach, lung or uterus.

But it remained unclear whether the condition could signal an increased risk of all cancers, and how it ties in with factors such as age and sex.

Writing in the British Journal of General Practice, Bailey and colleagues report how they examined data from almost 50,000 individuals aged 40 or over who had been given a blood test by their GP. The patients were selected at random from a national database.

In total, over 31,000 patients found to have a raised platelet count, and nearly 8,000 without, were included in the analysis.

Within a year of the blood test, the team found that cancer was more common among those who had thrombocytosis: 11.6% of men and 6.2% of women were found to have cancer compared to 4.1% of men and 2.2% of women without a raised platelet count. In the general population about 1% of individuals over the age of 40 develop cancer each year.

For comparison, among women aged between 50 and 59 who have discovered a breast lump, the proportion who are found to have breast cancer is 8.5%.



“We found cancer was more commonly diagnosed in men with raised platelet counts than it was in women with raised platelet counts and we believe that is because there are more causes of raised platelet counts in women that are not cancer,” said Bailey.

The team add that cancer was more common among for those who had thrombocytosis for longer. Of the men who had a raised platelet count of the same value or higher six months after being diagnosed with thrombocytosis, 18.1% developed cancer, while for women the figure was 10.1%.

While many different types of cancer were present in both groups, the team found that breast and prostate cancers were less common among those with thrombocytosis than in the general population, while lung and colorectal cancers were more common.

For about a third of cases of lung and colorectal cancer in patients with thrombocytosis, there had been no other symptoms that raised the suggestion of cancer. That, say the researchers, makes testing for raised platelet count a valuable tool, and could speed up cancer diagnosis by at least three months for thousands of patients a year.

Richard Neal, professor of primary care oncology at the University of Leeds who was not involved in the research, welcomed the study.

“This is an excellent study that demonstrates the potential for a commonly used blood test to identify some patients with cancer earlier,” he said.

“This work should begin to change practice, so that GPs should be testing patients with raised platelet counts for cancer, especially those without other potential cancer symptoms,” he added.

Dr Jasmine Just, Cancer Research UK’s health information officer, said more research was need to confirm whether further tests following a high platelet count would save lives.

“There are lots of possible reasons a person’s platelet count might be high, and in most cases it won’t be down to cancer,” she added.

“Measuring platelet count in patients who don’t otherwise warrant a blood test is not necessarily a good idea. But if a patient has a blood test for another reason and a high platelet count is found, then one of the possible diagnoses doctors should consider is cancer.”"	High blood platelet count 'as good a cancer predictor as a lump in the breast'	2017-05-23 06:00:00	https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/may/23/high-blood-platelet-count-as-good-a-cancer-predictor-as-a-lump-in-the-breast	story_reviews_00229	true
"(CNN) Cannabidiol, which is found in marijuana plants, reduced the number of convulsive seizures in children with a severe and often fatal epilepsy disorder, according to research published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine . Among children taking cannabidiol, the decrease in the frequency of convulsive seizures -- which involve a loss of consciousness, stiffened muscles and jerking movements -- was 23 percentage points greater than the decrease in seizures among children taking a placebo.

The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled human trial, which is considered the gold standard test for any new medicine.

GW Pharmaceuticals, a company that is developing cannabidiol medicines, helped subsidize the study.

""After 3,800 years of cannabis use for epilepsy ... we finally have solid evidence,"" said Dr. Orrin Devinsky, lead author of the study and director of NYU Langone's Comprehensive Epilepsy Center. His own previous research indicates that cannabis was used as early as 1800 B.C. in Sumeria to treat epilepsy; neurologists of the Victorian period used Indian hemp, which is rich in cannabidiol, for the same purpose.

Despite the generally positive results, most study participants reported side effects that included vomiting, fatigue, diarrhea and some liver issues.

""CBD is an effective drug for this type of rare epilepsy but was not a panacea (or cure-all) for these children,"" Devinsky said.

What is Dravet syndrome?

A total of 120 patients with Dravet syndrome, ranging in age from nearly 2 to 18 years old, were randomly assigned to receive either an oral solution of cannabidiol or a placebo for a 14-week period.

""Dravet syndrome is a severe childhood-onset epilepsy that causes multiple kinds of seizures, developmental delays, speech and language problems, behavioral issues and movement and balance problems,"" said Brandy Fureman, vice president of research and new therapies at the Epilepsy Foundation. She was not involved in the new study.

Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that disrupts electrical communication between neurons in the brain. Considered a spectrum disorder, different epilepsy syndromes are defined by clusters of symptoms or features and treated accordingly.

Existing epilepsy medications usually don't work for patients with Dravet, so ""up to 20% of these children die from seizures before age 20 years,"" Devinsky explained.

Within the study, individual participants experienced convulsive seizures at a rate ranging from four per month, on average, to 1,717 per month.

During the 14-week study, frequency of convulsive seizures decreased from an average of 12.4 to 5.9 per month in the cannabidiol group, compared with 14.9 to 14.1 in the placebo group. On average, the change in seizure frequency amounted to a 39% decrease for the cannabidiol group patients, compared with a roughly 13% decrease among the placebo group.

Five percent of the children became entirely seizure-free during the 14-week study. Overall, parents in the cannabidiol group felt that they witnessed ""significantly greater"" positive changes in their children than parents in the placebo group.

However, there was a downside. Most (93%) of the cannabidiol patients reported side effects, though three-quarters of the placebo group patients did as well. Nine out of 61 cannabidiol group patients dropped out of the study, eight of them because of side effects, compared with just three of the 59 placebo group patients.

""Tiredness (somnolence or fatigue) was most common; others were decreased appetite, diarrhea and vomiting,"" Devinsky explained.

Based on the overall results, Devinsky believes CBD should be evaluated for epilepsy types beyond Dravet syndrome, which is caused by a genetic mutation and affects about one in 20,000 to 40,000 children in the United States.

Wayne Hall, professor and director of the Centre for Youth Substance Abuse Research at the University of Queensland in Australia, also believes the findings are ""sufficiently encouraging"" to warrant further research of cannabidiol that focuses on ""related forms of epilepsy.""

'Critically important' for the epilepsy community

""No one study decides an issue; the sample size is still relatively small (because this is a rare syndrome and so hard to study large numbers of cases) and the duration of treatment so far has been relatively short,"" Hall, who was not involved in the research, wrote in an email.

Still, Hall said the research, which carefully measured safety and efficacy for a ""substantial"" number of children, showed ""clear evidence of benefits in reducing seizure frequency and severity over the duration of the trial.""

""glad to see"" data coming out. Porter is not one of the researchers behind this study, though she too has published papers on cannabidiol as a treatment for epilepsy. Dr. Brenda Porter, associate professor of neurology at Stanford School of Medicine, said she's""glad to see"" data coming out. Porter is not one of the researchers behind this study, though she too has published papers on cannabidiol as a treatment for epilepsy.

""Interestingly, it looks similar to our other seizure medications in terms of efficacy and tolerability,"" Porter said. ""So, sadly, not a home run for most patients but another tool in our treatment regimen.""

The marijuana plant is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance. Scientific researchers studying cannabidiol must meet federal security requirements and follow federal practices. Some scientists have said these federal requirements have slowed research supporting medicinal benefits of the plant.

Porter believes the study may open the door to having ""more thoughtful discussions with our patients about the efficacy and the side effects"" of cannabidiol. ""Hopefully, the FDA will see this as a sign it should be moved off of Schedule I. If it stays on Schedule I, we will have trouble getting it to our patients when it does become available.""

The 1970 Controlled Substances Act classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug , meaning it has ""no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.""

Changing the schedule of a drug falls to the Drug Enforcement Administration or the Department of Health and Human Services. An interested party, such as a drug company, may also petition for the process to begin. The Food and Drug Administration and the National Institute of Drug Abuse provide guidance to the DEA when reviewing scientific evidence on which to base a schedule change.

Dr. David Gloss, director of clinical neurophysiology at CAMC Health System in Charleston, West Virginia, believes the new study is ""very important"" because ""there's a lot of people using cannabidiol for all kinds of stuff."" Gloss co-authored a review of cannabinoids for the Cochrane Library , which publishes systematic reviews of medical research. He was not involved in the new research.

He noted that generating more evidence of effective use is ""a good thing.""

Already, there is existing "" medical evidence of efficacy for narrow neurologic conditions,"" said Gloss, who hopes that when enough evidence is available, the classification of cannabidiol as a Schedule I drug might be reconsidered and changed.

The University of Queensland's Hall believes that boundaries between medical use of cannabinoids and the recreational use of cannabis by adults should not be blurred. ""If future clinical trials confirm these promising results, then appropriate regulation will enable the drug to be safely used for medical purposes,"" he said.

The Epilepsy Foundation's Fureman said, ""before publication of this trial, much of the clinical evidence about CBD's effects on people's seizures was uncontrolled and anecdotal."" She added that the new study is ""critically important"" for the epilepsy community, which believes a CBD-based medical product would be a first-in-class therapeutic option.

On the need for more scientific research, all these experts agree.

As Devinsky said, ""natural substances are not necessarily safe and effective. They need to be evaluated rigorously."""	Cannabidiol slashes seizures in kids with rare epilepsy, study finds	2017-05-24 06:00:00	http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/24/health/cannabidiol-epilepsy-study/index.html	story_reviews_00227	true
"""Cannabidiol should not be viewed as a panacea for epilepsy, but for patients with especially severe forms who have not responded to numerous medications, these results provide hope that we may soon have another treatment option,"" says lead investigator Orrin Devinsky, MD, professor of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry and director of the Comprehensive Epilepsy Center at NYU Langone Medical Center. ""We still need more research, but this new trial provides more evidence than we have ever had of cannabidiol's effectiveness as a medication for treatment-resistant epilepsy.""

Cannabidiol, or CBD, is a compound in the cannabis plant that does not contain psychoactive properties that induce a high. The study included a liquid pharmaceutical formulation of CBD, called Epidiolex, which is manufactured by GW Pharmaceuticals and has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. GW Pharmaceuticals funded the clinical trial.

For the study, 120 children and adolescents with Dravet Syndrome between the ages of 2 and 18 years were randomized across 23 sites in the United States and Europe to receive either CBD 20 mg/kg or placebo added to their existing treatment over a 14-week period. Seizure frequency was tracked for one month prior to the study for baseline readings, and during the course of the study.

Specifically, seizure frequency dropped in the CBD-treated group by 39 percent from a median of nearly 12 convulsive seizures per month before the study to about six; three patients' seizures stopped entirely. In the placebo group, there was a 13 percent reduction in seizures from about 15 monthly seizures to fourteen. The difference in the degree of seizure reduction between the CBD group and the placebo group was both statistically significant and clinically consistent.

Side effects – experienced by 93.4 percent of patients in the CBD group and 74.6 percent of those treated with placebo – were generally reported as mild or moderate in severity. The most common side effects in the CBD group were vomiting, fatigue and fever. Eight participants from the CBD group withdrew from the trial due to side effects compared to one participant in the placebo group.

The new study confirms results from a December 2015 open-label expanded access program led by Dr. Devinsky that reported reductions in seizure frequency. In that program, both the researchers and patient's families knew they were receiving CBD, which may have introduced a bias into the results. This new, randomized, controlled clinical study eliminated those concerns as participants and their physicians did not know if they were on CBD or placebo, say the study authors.

Future research will look at whether safety and tolerability might be improved and whether efficacy of CBD can be maintained at lower doses. Longer term studies of CBD for Dravet Syndrome as well as for other forms of treatment-resistant epilepsy are also underway.

In addition to Dr. Devinsky, the co-authors in this study were: J.

"A treatment for obesity could be on the horizon as scientists have discovered an antibody that reduces body fat.

In trials on mice, the antibody was found to increase bone mass and reduce adipose tissue (fat)—and while human studies are some way off, the findings could lead to new treatments for weight loss and osteoporosis.

The antibody discovered targets follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) found in the pituitary gland. Ten years ago, scientists started looking at the hormones made in the pituitary gland to see how they act on certain targets. They found some of these hormones had an effect on bone mass.

From this, they created an antibody to see if it could be used to prevent bone loss in mice—and in 2010, they showed it could. As a result, they started considering it as a potential treatment for osteoporosis, particularly in post-menopausal women—a period when women lose bone mass fairly quickly.

But scientists also realized it could have other uses. Mone Zaidi, from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, is one of the authors on the latest study into how the antibody triggers weight loss. “Osteoporosis and obesity are fairly closely linked in several ways,” he tells Newsweek. “Women, when they undergo menopause, lose bone and gain body fat. So we thought maybe there was a connection—that FSH could have direct effects on adipose tissue.”

In the study, published in Nature, scientists injected the antibody into mice that had had their ovaries removed (mimicking menopause) and mice that had been fed on a high-fat diet. In both cases, the antibody caused significant weight loss and gains in bone mass.

Zaidi says they looked at the adipose tissue in different areas of the body, including under the skin and around the vital organs. “In all compartments it was [fat] reduced by around this level. It’s a fairly dramatic effect.” Mice also showed increased oxygen consumption, higher levels of physical activity and more heat production in beige fat (which dissipates energy around the body).

But how do mice models translate to human treatments? Mice a fairly close genetic match to Humans, and Zaidi is hopeful there will be similar effects in humans.

Their next step is to “humanize” the antibody, so it can be tested without triggering an immune response. “We would then hopefully go to the next phase of preclinical testing, which would be to look at side effects, toxicology etc. After that, we would go into primates and larger animals. That would then lead—if all goes well—to the first human trials in three to four years.”

At present, the researchers are focusing on the adiposity, rather than bone loss, for drug development: “I think obesity is a more prevalent disease—but osteoporosis at the tail end can be tagged on. Also to do trials for osteoporosis takes a very long time,” Zaidi says.

Eventually, he hopes to end up with an injected drug that gets rid of fat and increases bone mass. “That’s the ideal situation,” he says. “It could be a unique obesity drug. But it could also be a unique drug because it lowers body fat and makes bones stronger. And the population that could be most benefited by this could be post-menopausal women.”

Commenting on the research, Tim Speckor, Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at King’s College London, U.K., says: “It’s a nice mouse study that seems to work—whether it works in humans is another matter.”"	Obesity Cure?

"With little fanfare, the Food and Drug Administration did something this week that it’s never done before: The agency approved a single prescription drug, pembrolizumab (marketed by Merck as Keytruda) for treatment of solid tumors in any organ so long as the malignancy bears a specific genetic signature.

In the fast-moving field of cancer treatment, the FDA’s announcement marks an important milestone, close to two decades in the making. Increasingly, cancer will no longer be identified, categorized and treated by the organ it inhabits, or in which it first gained its foothold. In a shift that is already underway, cancers will be known by — and treated for — the common genetic mutations that nurture and sustain them.

In clinical trial evidence cited by the FDA this week, pembrolizumab induced complete or partial tumor shrinkage in about 40% of patients with one of 15 end-stage malignancies. And for 78% of those patients, that response lasted six months or more. A trial reported earlier this year found that in 17 of 30 advanced cancer patients, pembrolizumab stopped or reversed the progression of cancer, and 24 patients were still alive a year after starting the drug.

All of those subjects, of course, had cancers with the genetic mutation that pembrolizumab is designed to target.

In the treatment of patients with metastatic cancers that have failed all other treatments, that record of success constitutes a “home run,” said Dr. Bert Vogelstein of Johns Hopkins University’s Kimmel Cancer Center. Vogelstein’s 1993 research laid the groundwork for the discovery of pembrolizumab’s broad cancer-fighting powers.

With the FDA’s announcement, drugs like pembrolizumab have also begun to change the way that physicians, patients and government regulators think of cancer. No longer will they see all cancers of the lung, breast, colon, brain, liver, pancreas and prostate as distinct from one another. Instead, they will look for the common genetic mutations that give rise to cancers no matter where they’re found. And they’ll treat those cancers with a drug that uses that common signature as a homing beacon, either for the immune system or for targeted cancer drugs to attack.

It’s a key principle of what’s called “precision medicine” — the idea that cancer therapies should zero in on a tumor’s specific molecular fingerprint, and not, as most chemotherapies do, harm healthy cells in the process of attacking malignant ones.

In the cancers pembrolizumab treats, the mutations occur in the complex of genes that govern DNA repair. Deficiencies in the DNA’s “mismatch repair system” generate mutant proteins on the surface of cancer cells, and pembrolizumab trains the immune system to attack those targets. The mutations that make pembrolizumab effective had already been found in melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer and Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and the FDA had already approved the drug for those cancers before this week.

But this week’s FDA approval goes further: It makes clear that the drug’s molecular targets are also common in colorectal, endometrial and gastrointestinal cancers, and less frequently present in cancers of the breast, prostate, bladder, and thyroid gland.

All told, scientists believe about 4% of advanced cancers bear the genetic signature that would make them treatable by Keytruda.

The appearance of such a cancer workhorse will bring about profound changes on the cancer landscape — not just for patients but for researchers and drug regulators as well.

Organizations representing, say, people with pancreatic cancer will make common cause with groups that advocate for colorectal cancer patients. In cancer centers, specialists in, say, melanoma will start (in fact, have already started) treating patients with a range of other cancers. When drug companies and their academic partners set out to test the effectiveness of a prospective cancer drug, they’ll have to recruit trial subjects using a new and much less obvious criterion than they’ve used in the past: the genetic signatures their tumors bear.

Even before the FDA’s announcement this week, all these processes were underway. The FDA’s decision recognizes that fact, said Dr. Svetomir Markovic, an immunologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., who specializes in treating melanoma.

But the decision also puts cancer physicians — as well as insurers, who will be called on to pay Keytruda’s $100,000-per-year price tag — on notice that a new era is at hand, said Markovic.

“The field of cancer medicine is changing at lightning speed,” he said. Physicians “are having a hard time keeping up, and I can only imagine that people who are regulating it are doing the same,” he added. “But this decision by the FDA is really wonderful: It has made it easier for us to secure treatment for our patients who may have run out of options that may help.”

Two other immunotherapy drugs have been approved for cancer treatment — nivolumab (marketed as Opdivo) and ipilimumab (Yervoy) — but neither has been shown to treat cancers across such a broad spectrum. Several other immunotherapy drugs are in early trials, and could yet prove to be the sort of workhorse that pembrolizumab appears to be.

“In many ways we’re at the end of the beginning of immunotherapy: There’s clear benefit but it’s still a minority of patients that get long-term benefit,” said Markovic of the Mayo Institute. “We will get better at this.”

Markovic suggested that the newly recognized powers of pembrolizumab, as well as the FDA’s new openness to cancer drugs that blur traditional distinctions, could prompt drug companies, physicians and patient groups to take a second look at some abandoned cancer drugs. With a clearer idea of which patients they might help, and a willingness to design and conduct innovative clinical trials, some failures may look more promising, he said.

“We just needed to take the first step in showing that this long-believed theory — that the immune system can kill cancer — is true,” Markovic added. “It indeed can.”

"LA JOLLA, CA – May 29, 2017 – Scientists at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) have given new superpowers to a lifesaving antibiotic called vancomycin, an advance that could eliminate the threat of antibiotic-resistant infections for years to come. The researchers, led by Dale Boger, co-chair of TSRI’s Department of Chemistry, discovered a way to structurally modify vancomycin to make an already-powerful version of the antibiotic even more potent.

“Doctors could use this modified form of vancomycin without fear of resistance emerging,” said Boger, whose team announced the finding today in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The original form of vancomycin is an ideal starting place for developing better antibiotics. The antibiotic has been prescribed by doctors for 60 years, and bacteria are only now developing resistance to it. This suggests bacteria already have a hard time overcoming vancomycin’s original “mechanism of action,” which works by disrupting how bacteria form cell walls.

Boger called vancomycin “magical” for its proven strength against infections, and previous studies by Boger and his colleagues at TSRI had shown that it is possible to add two modifications to vancomycin to make it even more potent. “With these modifications, you need less of the drug to have the same effect,” Boger said.

The new study shows that scientists can make a third modification—which interferes with a bacterium’s cell wall in a new way—with promising results. Combined with the previous modifications, this alteration gives vancomycin a 1,000-fold increase in activity, meaning doctors would need to use less of the antibiotic to fight infection.

The discovery makes this version of vancomycin the first antibiotic to have three independent mechanisms of action. “This increases the durability of this antibiotic,” said Boger. “Organisms just can’t simultaneously work to find a way around three independent mechanisms of action. Even if they found a solution to one of those, the organisms would still be killed by the other two.”

Tested against Enterococci bacteria, the new version of vancomycin killed both vancomycin-resistant Enterococci and the original forms of Enterococci.

The next step in this research is to design a way to synthesize the modified vancomycin using fewer steps in the lab, as the current method takes 30 steps. But Boger calls this the “easy part” of the project, compared with the challenge of designing the molecule in the first place.

Even if the process isn’t streamlined, Boger believes the new vancomycin’s lifesaving powers make its production valuable. “Antibiotics are total cures for bacterial infections,” said Boger. “Making this molecule is important, even by the current approach, if the failure of antibiotics continues.”

In addition to Boger, authors of the study, “Peripheral modifications of [Ψ[CH2NH]Tpg4]vancomycin with added synergistic mechanisms of action provide durable and potent antibiotics,” included first author Akinori Okano and Nicholas A. Isley, both of TSRI.

The study was supported by the National Institutes of Health (grants F32 GM114948 and CA041101).

New Antibiotic Packs a Punch Against Bacterial Resistance	2017-05-29 00:00:00	http://www.newswise.com/articles/new-antibiotic-packs-a-punch-against-bacterial-resistance	news_reviews_00223	fake
"CLEVELAND, Ohio (May 17, 2017)--Fennel, an anise-flavored herb used for cooking, has long been known for its health benefits for a variety of issues, including digestion and premenstrual symptoms. A new study confirms that it is also effective in the management of postmenopause symptoms such as hot flashes, sleeplessness, vaginal dryness, and anxiety, without serious side effects. The study outcomes are published online today in Menopause, the journal of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS).

The use of complementary and alternative medicine for the management of menopause symptoms has surged in recent years as women have attempted to identify alternatives to hormone therapy (HT). Although HT is the most effective treatment for managing most menopause symptoms, some women have turned to herbal medicine because they are either not candidates for HT or are concerned about the negative publicity surrounding potential side effects. Fennel, an herb containing essential oils, has phytoestrogenic properties. Phytoestrogens are estrogen-like chemicals in plants that have been used to effectively treat a wide array of menopause symptoms.

In this small trial of 79 Iranian women aged 45 to 60 years, soft capsules containing 100 mg of fennel were administered twice daily for eight weeks. Improvements were compared between the intervention and placebo groups at four, eight, and 10 weeks, with a significant statistical difference documented. In the end, fennel was concluded to be a safe and effective treatment to reduce menopause symptoms without serious side effects. The study described in the article ""Effect of Foeniculum vulgare Mill. (fennel) on menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women: a randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled trial"" is one of the first clinical studies to examine the benefits of fennel for managing menopause symptoms, even though it had been previously studied and confirmed to manage premenopause symptoms.

The study was completed in Tehran, Iran, where the average age of women at menopause is younger than in the United States: 48.2 years versus 51 years, respectively. Some of the most common adverse effects of menopause are hot flashes, vaginal dryness, sleep problems, joint and muscular discomfort, exhaustion, irritability, anxiety, and depression.

""This small pilot study found that, on the basis of a menopause-rating scale, twice-daily consumption of fennel as a phytoestrogen improved menopause symptoms compared with an unusual minimal effect of placebo,"" says Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton, executive director of NAMS. ""A larger, longer, randomized study is still needed to help determine its long-term benefits and side effect profile.""

"A recent study from the Center for BrainHealth at The University of Texas at Dallas shows that a certain type of instructor-led brain training protocol can stimulate structural changes in the brain and neural connections even years after a traumatic brain injury (TBI).

The findings, published in Brain and Behavior, further suggest that changes in cortical thickness and neural network connectivity may prove an effective way to quantitatively measure treatment efficacy, an ability that has not existed until now. Building upon previous research, the study challenges the widely held belief that recovery from a TBI is limited to two years after an injury.

""A TBI disrupts brain structure. These brain changes can interfere with brain network communication and the cognitive functions those networks support,"" said Dr. Kihwan Han, research scientist at the Center for BrainHealth and lead author of the study.

""For people with chronic TBI, they may have trouble with daily tasks such as creating shopping lists and resolving conflicts with others for many years after the injury. These findings provide hope for people who thought, 'This is as good as my recovery is going to get' and for the medical community who have yet to find a way to objectively measure a patient's recovery,"" he said.

The study included 60 adults with TBI symptoms lasting an average of eight years. Participants were randomly placed into one of two cognitive training groups: strategy-based training or knowledge-based training. Over an eight-week period, the strategy-based training group learned strategies to improve attention and reasoning. The knowledge-based training group learned information about the structure and function of the brain as well as the effects of sleep and exercise on brain performance.

Magnetic resonance imaging measured cortical thickness and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) before training, after training and three months post-training. Previous studies have shown that cortical thickness and rsFC can be potential markers for training-induced brain changes.

Individuals in the strategy-based reasoning training showed a greater change in cortical thickness and connectivity compared to individuals who received the knowledge-based training. Changes in cortical thickness and functional connectivity also correlated to an individual's ability to switch between tasks quickly and consistently to achieve a specific goal.

""People who showed the greatest change in cortical thickness and connectivity, showed the greatest performance increases in our cognitive tasks. Perhaps future studies could investigate the added benefit of brain stimulation treatments in combination with cognitive training for individuals with chronic TBI who experience problems with attention, memory or executive functions,"" Han said.

Strategic brain training positively affects neural connectivity for individuals with TBI	2017-05-29 06:00:00	https://web.archive.org/web/20170523075612/https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-05/cfb-sbt052217.php	news_reviews_00225	true
"There is no significant difference between zinc acetate lozenges and zinc gluconate lozenges regarding their efficacy in shortening the duration of common colds according to a meta-analysis published in Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine Open. Seven randomized trials with zinc acetate and zinc gluconate lozenges found that the duration of colds was shortened on average by 33%.

Zinc lozenges appear to influence the common cold through the release of free zinc ions into the oro-pharyngeal region. However, zinc ions can bind tightly to various chemical complexes in such a way that little or no free zinc ions are released. Previously zinc lozenges containing citric acid were shown to be ineffective in treating colds because citric acid binds zinc ions very tightly and no free zinc is released.

Zinc acetate has been proposed as the most ideal salt for zinc lozenges since acetate binds to zinc ions very weakly. Zinc gluconate is another salt that has been frequently used in zinc lozenges. However, gluconate binds the zinc ion more tightly than acetate does. Because of the somewhat stronger binding, zinc gluconate has been proposed to be less suitable constituent for lozenges. Although the binding difference between zinc acetate and zinc gluconate is a fact, it is not evident whether that causes significant differences at the clinical level for treating the common cold.

In the meta-analysis, Dr. Harri Hemilä from the University of Helsinki, Finland, collected randomized trials on zinc acetate and zinc gluconate lozenges and compared their observed efficacies. Three trials had used zinc acetate lozenges and found that colds were shortened on average by 40%. Four trials had used zinc gluconate lozenges and colds were shortened on average by 28%. The 12% difference between the average effects of the two kinds of lozenges was explained purely by random variation. Furthermore, one of the zinc gluconate lozenge trials was an outlier inconsistent with all the other six zinc lozenge trials. If that outlier trial was excluded, the difference between the three zinc acetate and the three zinc gluconate trials shrinked to just 2%, i.e., a 40% vs. 38% reduction in common cold duration. Thus, properly composed zinc gluconate lozenges may be as effective as zinc acetate lozenges.

Dr. Hemilä also analyzed the dose response relationship between the elemental zinc dose and the observed efficacy in reducing common cold duration. There was no difference in the efficacy between five trials that used 80 to 92 mg of zinc per day and the two trials that used 192 and 207 mg of zinc per day. Thus, zinc doses of over 100 mg per day do not seem to provide any more benefit.

According to Dr. Hemilä, there is no justification for the popular phrase that ""there is no cure for the common cold"" because of the strong evidence that zinc lozenges can shorten common cold duration by over 30%. However, in future studies the optimal composition of zinc lozenges should be investigated. The optimum frequency of their administration also warrants further investigation. Nevertheless, he also considers that ""the current evidence of efficacy for zinc lozenges is so strong that common cold patients should be encouraged to try them for treating their colds, but the patients should ascertain that the lozenges do not contain citric acid or its salt citrate.""

"DURHAM, N.C. -- Duke University researchers have developed a handheld device for cervical cancer screening that promises to do away with uncomfortable speculums and high-cost colposcopes.

The ""pocket colposcope"" is a slender wand that can connect to many devices, including laptops or cell phones.

If widely adopted, women might even use the device to self-screen, transforming screening and cure rates in low-income countries and regions of the United States, where cervical cancer is most prevalent.

Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women, with more than 500,000 new cases occurring annually worldwide. In the United States, physicians diagnose more than 10,000 cases each year. While more than 4,000 American women die of the disease each year, the mortality rate has dropped more than 50 percent in the past four decades, largely due to the advent of well-organized screening and diagnostic programs.

While the Pap smear can be performed by a non-specialist, colposcopy requires visualization of the cervix, relying on highly trained professionals and expensive equipment that is not easily accessible to underserved populations. These factors make cervical cancer more prevalent in women living in low socioeconomic communities.

In a new paper published on May 31 in the journal PLOS One, researchers from Duke believe they have found a better way.

""The mortality rate of cervical cancer should absolutely be zero percent because we have all the tools to see and treat it,"" said Nimmi Ramanujam, the Robert W. Carr, Jr., Professor of Biomedical Engineering at Duke. ""But it isn't. That is in part because women do not receive screening or do not follow up on a positive screening to have colposcopy performed at a referral clinic. We need to bring colposcopy to women so that we can reduce this complicated string of actions into a single touch point.""

Current standard practices for cervical cancer screening require three things: a speculum, a colposcope and a trained professional to administer the test.

The speculum is a metal device designed to spread the vaginal walls apart. The colposcope is a magnified telescopic device and camera designed to allow medical professionals to look through the speculum to see the cervix, which is located three to six inches inside the vagina. Colposcopes and people who know how to use them are difficult to find in many low-income regions, both domestically and internationally.

Ramanujam believes she can replace at least two of these requirements. Her laboratory has developed an all-in-one device that resembles a pocket-sized tampon with lights and a camera at one end. Health providers -- or even women themselves -- are able to capture images of the cervix using the rounded tip of the device to manipulate its position if necessary. The device also includes a channel through which contrast agents used for the cervical cancer screening procedure can be applied.

""We recruited 15 volunteers on Duke's campus to try out the new integrated speculum-colposcope design,"" said Mercy Asiedu, a graduate student working on the project in Ramanujam's lab. ""Nearly everyone said they preferred it to a traditional speculum and more than 80 percent of the women who tried the device were able to get a good image. Those that couldn't felt that they just needed some practice.""

Ramanujam and Asiedu are now working on clinical trials to see how their design stacks up against the traditional colposcopy used with a speculum. By using both methods to visualize the cervix, the researchers will be able to make a direct comparison.

Asiedu is also working to automate the screening process. By using image processing and machine learning to teach computers how to spot signs of precancerous and cancerous cells, Asiedu hopes to remove the need for a trained physician at any point in the screening process and shift the task to midwives, community health workers and even the women themselves.

""There have been a few other attempts to come up with a better solution, but none of them have succeeded,"" said Asiedu. ""One design using an inflatable cylinder proved just as uncomfortable as a traditional speculum. Another using directed airflow is just as bulky and expensive as a modern colposcope. With our handheld, low-cost design, we're hoping to redefine the entire procedure.""

"DUARTE, Calif. -- A City of Hope-led study found that the use of low-dose aspirin (81mg) reduces the risk of breast cancer in women who are part of the California's Teacher's Study. This study -- which is the first to suggest that the reduction in risk occurs for low-dose aspirin -- was proposed by City of Hope's Leslie Bernstein, Ph.D., professor and director of the Division of Biomarkers of Early Detection and Prevention, and published online in the journal, Breast Cancer Research.

Bernstein and her colleagues saw an overall 16 percent lower risk of breast cancer in women who reported using low-dose aspirin at least three times per week. Such regular use of low-dose aspirin reduced the risk by 20 percent of estrogen or progesterone receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer, which is the most common breast cancer subtype.

""The study found an interesting protective association between low-dose aspirin and breast cancer,"" said lead author Christina A. Clarke, Ph.D., M.P.H., from the Cancer Prevention Institute of California. ""We did not by and large find associations with the other pain medications like ibuprofen and acetaminophen. We also did not find associations with regular aspirin since this type of medication is taken sporadically for headaches or other pain, and not daily for prevention of cardiovascular disease.""

This study differed from other studies that have looked at aspirin and cancer risk because it focused on the dose levels of the aspirin women had taken and tracked the frequency of the use of low-dose aspirin as opposed to regular aspirin. It was also able to look in detail at subtypes of breast cancer.

""We already knew that aspirin is a weak aromatase inhibitor and we treat women with breast cancer with stronger aromatase inhibitors since they reduce the amount of estrogen postmenopausal women have circulating in their blood,"" said Bernstein. ""We thought that if aspirin can inhibit aromatase, it ought to reduce the likelihood that breast cancer would develop and it could also be an effective way to improve breast cancer patients' prognosis once they no longer take the more potent aromatase inhibitors."" Bernstein added, ""Aspirin also reduces inflammation, which may be another mechanism by which aspirin taken regularly can lower risk of breast cancer developing or recurring.""

As part of the study, researchers analyzed data recorded in questionnaires submitted by 57,164 women in the California's Teacher's Study. In 2005, participants answered questions regarding family history of cancer and other conditions, use of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), menstrual and reproductive history, use of hormones, weight and height, living environment, diet, alcohol use and physical activity. In the ensuing years before 2013, 1,457 of these participants developed invasive breast cancer.

The team of researchers chose to focus on low-dose ""baby"" aspirin, because not only is it inexpensive and readily available as potential means of prevention, but because there are already a lot of people already taking it for prevention of other diseases such as heart disease and even colon cancer.

Now that we have some data separating low-dose from higher-dose aspirin, more detailed research can be undertaken to understand the full value of low-dose aspirin for breast cancer prevention,"" said Clarke.""

New research published online in The FASEB Journal suggests that tendon stem (TSCs) may be able to significantly improve tendon healing by regulating inflammation, which contributes to scar-like tendon healing and chronic matrix degradation. This has implications for the treatment of acute tendon injuries and chronic tendon disease.

""Inflammation plays a critical role in acute and chronic tendon injuries and healing,"" said Chang H. Lee, Ph.D., a researcher involved in the work and an assistant professor at the Regenerative Engineering Laboratory (Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York). ""Our findings represent an important foundation for the development of a new treatment that would regulate overwhelmed inflammation for tendon ruptures and tears, tendonitis, tendinopathy, and other tendon injuries and diseases.""

In their study, Lee and colleagues used both in vitro human models and in vivo rat models. In vitro, isolated TSCs were stimulated with proinflammatory cytokines (proteins that can influence interactions between cells), and the expression of genes involved in inflammatory regulation was measured. In vivo, the researchers evaluated inflammatory responses by TSCs, including infiltration of macrophages (white blood cells that consume damaged or dead cells) and expression of anti-/proinflammatory cytokines, at different time points. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) was used in both models to stimulate the anti-inflammatory roles of TSCs. The researchers found that CTGF stimulation induced TSCs' production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, consequently leading to improved tendon healing and matrix remodeling.

""Many would have predicted that tendon healing is inflammation-linked,"" said Thoru Pederson, Ph.D., Editor-in-Chief of The FASEB Journal, ""but that the anti-inflammatory roles of TSCs could be so potent, and so amplifiable, is a striking finding.""

"CHICAGO --- A cancer drug for patients with certain types of leukemia and lymphoma can also prevent reactions to some of the most common airborne allergies, according to a recent Northwestern Medicine study. The promising data from this pilot study could have greater implications for adults with food allergies.

The cancer patients who were allergic to allergens such as cat dander and ragweed saw their allergic skin test reactivity reduced by 80 to 90 percent in one week, and this persisted with continued use of the drug for at least one to two months. The findings were published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology in May.

""It almost completely knocked out the patients' skin test and blood cell allergic reactivity,"" said senior author Dr. Bruce Bochner, the Samuel M. Feinberg Professor of Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.

This FDA-approved drug, ibrutinib, is currently on the market as a successful and less-toxic alternative to chemotherapy for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma. In this recent study, Bochner and his team performed traditional allergy skin tests and the basophil activation test, a related allergy test using blood cells, on cancer patients before they had taken ibrutinib and again after one week and after one to two months of taking it.

A rather unlikely pairing - cancer and allergies - Bochner thought to test if a cancer drug could prevent allergic reactions by collaborating with Feinberg's oncology department.

He knew that the generally well-tolerated cancer drug was successful in blocking a protein inside a cell called Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK). BTK plays a crucial role in B cell activation, growth and maturation and mast cell and basophil activation, the latter two cells being responsible for immediate allergic reactions. Bochner teamed up with Northwestern oncologist Dr. Leo Gordon and colleagues to test if this BTK inhibitor could shut down an enzyme inside cells that is involved when you have an allergic reaction.

""Ibrutinib is considered a game changer in these two types of cancers,"" said Gordon, the Abby and John Friend Professor of Cancer Research at Feinberg. ""We understood that it might have some biologic effects in what Bruce is interested in, so we were happy to participate in his study. It's an interesting repurposing of that drug.""

While the study was small - only two patients qualified out of about 35 that were screened for allergies - the implications are much larger for later phases of this study. Bochner and his colleagues Drs. Anne Marie Singh and Melanie Dispenza are now testing how successful the drug is at targeting allergies to food, such as tree nuts and peanuts.

""Preventing or lessening the severity of an allergic reaction to a food you've ingested that you're allergic to is kind of the holy grail of food allergy treatment,"" Bochner said. ""I don't know if this or similar drugs will ever make it possible for a peanut-allergic person to eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but we're excited to use this approach to teach us how to lessen the risks of food allergy reactions.""

Currently, the study is being expanded to adults with food allergy to see if their skin test and basophil activation test responses show a similar reduction with just a few doses of ibrutinib and how long such benefits might last. If the results are favorable, the next step would be to get funding to actually test whether taking a BTK inhibitor will improve the ability of food-allergic adults to eat foods they're allergic to.

""The hope is that drugs like BTK inhibitors will protect people with food allergies from having anaphylaxis, or at least increase how much of that food they can eat without reacting,"" Bochner said. ""Maybe they'll increase from being able to eat just one peanut to 10 before they react. Or maybe they'll be able to eat a full meal's worth of peanuts. We want to know if this would safely change their actual ability to eat foods that they currently need to avoid.""

"Washington, DC (May 17, 2017) - Pasta is a convenient, nutritious, easy-to-prepare meal for families. Pasta pleases even the pickiest of young eaters. And now, even more good news: new research shows that pasta consumption in children and adolescents is associated with a better diet quality than that of children who do not eat pasta. The research, which was presented at the 2017 Experimental Biology conference at the end of April in Chicago, demonstrated that young pasta-eaters have greater intakes of important vitamins and minerals and lower intakes of saturated fat and total fat in the diet compared to their peers who do not consume pasta.

The research, ""Pasta Consumption in American Children and Adolescents is Associated with Greater Daily Intake of Shortfall Nutrients as Defined by the 2015 Dietary Guidelines, Improved Diet Quality and Lower Added Sugar Intake,"" was conducted by Nutritional Strategies, Inc. on behalf of the National Pasta Association. The study examined associations between pasta consumption, shortfall nutrient intakes as defined by the 2015 Dietary Guidelines (2015 DG) and diet quality in comparison to non-pasta consumption in U.S. children and adolescents (ages 2-18). Pasta consumption was defined as all dry domestic and imported pasta/noodle varieties made with only wheat and no egg. The data review did not look at any health outcomes associated with pasta consumption except for the ones specified below.

From the analysis, researchers identified a number of key positive nutritional dietary patterns associated with children and adolescents who eat pasta as part of their diet compared to those who don't eat pasta. They are:

-Better overall diet quality (as measured by USDA's Healthy Eating Index-2010 scale) -Greater intake of key shortfall nutrients like dietary fiber, folate, iron, magnesium and vitamin E -Lower daily intakes of saturated fat and total fat -No significant associations were seen with body weight, waist circumference and body mass index

Pasta has long been celebrated as one of America's favorite foods and is advocated by nutritionists for its good nutrition.

""Good nutrition is critical to the developing minds and bodies of children and adolescents. Certain grain foods, like pasta, are a great complement to a healthy well-balanced meal and provide plenty of opportunities for improving the diet,"" explains registered dietitian Diane Welland, Nutrition Communications Manager for the National Pasta Association. ""Think of pasta as a canvas from which you can add nutrient-dense, fiber-rich foods like fresh vegetables, fruits, cheese, lean meats and legumes, when creating meals for your family.""

Children and adolescents who eat pasta have better overall diet quality new research shows	2017-05-29 06:00:00	https://web.archive.org/web/20180422153254/https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-05/kc-n-caa051617.php	news_reviews_00229	true
"Chicago, IL (May 6, 2017) -- A new study finds that individuals struggling with obesity who are not candidates for weight-loss surgery can benefit substantially from non-surgical endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty, according to research presented at Digestive Disease Week® (DDW) 2017, the largest international gathering of physicians, researchers and academics in the fields of gastroenterology, hepatology, endoscopy and gastrointestinal surgery.

Patients who underwent ESG -- a procedure performed through the mouth with an endoscope to ""accordion"" the stomach by suturing pleats to reduce its size -- achieved greater weight loss than laparoscopic banding, but less weight loss than laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy surgery. Patients who received treatment endoscopically had shorter hospital stays and lower costs than those who had laparoscopic surgery.

""Obesity continues to be a problem in America and it is an epidemic rapidly spreading around the world,"" said Reem Z. Sharaiha, MD, MSc, assistant professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine and attending physician at New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, the study's lead author. ""Our research -- the first to compare these treatments -- demonstrates that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty is safe and effective in helping patients lead healthier lives. It should be considered as another tool available to clinicians and patients in the fight against obesity.""

Dr. Sharaiha followed 278 patients who underwent ESG (91 patients), laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (120 patients) or laparoscopic banding (67). During the one-year follow-up period, patients went to an academic bariatric center of excellence as part of their treatment.

At one-year follow-up, patients who chose laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy surgery achieved the greatest percent total body weight loss at 29.28 percent, compared to 17.57 percent for endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty patients and 14.46 percent for laparoscopic banding patients. Researchers found that patients who received endoscopic treatment had lower complications (1 percent) than those who received surgical treatment (10 percent for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and 11 percent for laparoscopic banding).

Dr. Sharaiha noted that these findings do not suggest that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty will replace the two surgical treatments as weight-loss interventions. Instead, these results show that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty is another possibility that patients and health-care providers should consider when discussing options.

While endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty is performed with an endoscopic device through the mouth, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy involves a small surgical incision in the belly to place a tube in the abdomen, allowing doctors to reduce the stomach's volume. With laparoscopic banding, doctors insert a tube through an incision in the belly to place a band around the stomach, restricting food intake.

The team also reported that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty patients customarily left the hospital on the same day of treatment, while laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy patients stayed for about three days and laparoscopic banding patients for a day and a half.

When examining cost, researchers reported endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty resulted in the lowest-cost, with an average institutional procedure cost of $12,000, compared to $22,000 for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and $15,000 for laparoscopic banding.

""For years, patients seeking weight-loss interventions had limited options because they could not tolerate or did not want surgery, or it was not even an option for them,"" added Dr. Sharaiha. ""Our research shows that endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty can be the treatment they've been looking for. It's less invasive than surgery and helps them reach their health goals.""

Obesity is associated with heart disease, stroke, diabetes and some cancers, and researchers estimate that it is the second-leading cause of preventable death, after tobacco use. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that more than one in three U.S. adults is obese, having a body mass index of 30 or more. The CDC estimated the medical cost of obesity in the U.S. at approximately $147 billion in 2008. Globally, the World Health Organization estimates that more than 600 million people were obese in 2014.

"Better known as an anesthetic or as an illicit hallucinogenic drug, ketamine has also long been noted for alleviating depression. But ketamine has not been tested in a large clinical trial, and all evidence of its antidepressant effects has come from anecdotes and small studies of fewer than 100 patients. Now, in the largest study of its kind, researchers at Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences at University of California San Diego mined the FDA Adverse Effect Reporting System (FAERS) database for depression symptoms in patients taking ketamine for pain. They found that depression was reported half as often among the more than 41,000 patients who took ketamine, as compared to patients who took any other drug or drug combination for pain.

The study, published May 3 in Scientific Reports, also uncovered antidepressant effects for three other drugs typically used for other purposes -- Botox, the pain reliever diclofenac and the antibiotic minocycline.

""Current FDA-approved treatments for depression fail for millions of people because they don't work or don't work fast enough,"" said senior author Ruben Abagyan, PhD, professor of pharmacy. ""This study extends small-scale clinical evidence that ketamine can be used to alleviate depression, and provides needed solid statistical support for wider clinical applications and possibly larger scale clinical trials.""

Abagyan led the study with pharmacy students Isaac Cohen and Tigran Makunts, and Rabia Atayee, PharmD, associate professor of clinical pharmacy, all at Skaggs School of Pharmacy.

The FAERS database contains more than 8 million patient records. The research team focused on patients in the database who received ketamine, narrowing their study population down to approximately 41,000. They applied a mathematical algorithm to look for statistically significant differences in reported depression symptoms for each patient.

""While most researchers and regulators monitor the FAERS database for increased incidences of symptoms in order to spot potentially harmful drug side effects, we were looking for the opposite -- lack of a symptom,"" Cohen said.

The team found that the incidence of depression symptoms in patients who took ketamine in addition to other pain therapeutics dropped by 50 percent (with an error margin less than 2 percent) compared to the patients who took any other drug or drug combination for pain. Patients who took ketamine also less frequently reported pain and opioid-associated side effects, such as constipation, as compared to patients who received other pain medications.

According to Abagyan, it is possible that another factor common to patients taking ketamine was driving the antidepressant effect, such as the fact that ketamine also relieves pain. That's why they compared ketamine patients with patients taking other pain medications. That control group eliminated the possibility that people who take ketamine have less depression because they have less pain. Abagyan says it's still possible, though unlikely, the effect could be due to a still unidentified confounding factor.

Three other drugs with previously under-appreciated antidepressant effects also emerged from this analysis: Botox, used cosmetically to treat wrinkles and medically to treat migraines and other disorders; diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID); and minocycline, an antibiotic.

After the diclofenac finding, Abagyan and team went back and looked at ketamine patients who did not also take NSAIDs and compared them to patients who took any other combination of drugs for pain except NSAIDs. Depression rates in patients taking ketamine remained low.

The researchers hypothesize that the antidepressant effects of diclofenac and minocycline may be due, at least in part, to their abilities to reduce inflammation. For Botox, the potential mechanism for reducing depression is less clear. The team is now working to separate Botox's beauty effects (which could indirectly make a person feel better emotionally) and its antidepressant effects. To do this, they are first using FAERS data to determine if collagen fillers and other cosmetic treatments similarly affect depression rates.

According to the World Health Organization, more than 300 million people experience depression worldwide. If not effectively treated, depression can become a chronic disease that increases a person's risk of mortality from suicide, heart disease or other factors. Depression is currently treated with five classes of antidepressants, most commonly serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

For financial and ethical reasons, ketamine has never been tested for its safety and effectiveness in treating depression in a large-scale clinical trial, but it reportedly works much more rapidly than standard antidepressants. Ketamine is relatively inexpensive and is covered by most health insurance plans if three other antidepressants fail.

""The approach we used here could be applied to any number of other conditions, and may reveal new and important uses for thousands of already approved drugs, without large investments in additional clinical trials,"" Makunts said.

"Robert Bush has multiple sclerosis (MS), which sapped his ability to walk five years ago. Joseph McGlynn suffered a stroke that seriously impaired his left side, also five years ago.

Using technology designed by Case Western Reserve University and the Advanced Platform Technology and Functional Electrical Stimulation centers at the Louis Stokes Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center, the two men got their feet back under them.

Two studies, published in the American Journal of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, show that functional electrical stimulation (FES) significantly helped McGlynn and Bush to effectively walk at the medical center.

""I went in there and I could barely take two steps,"" said Bush, 42, who researchers believe is the world's first MS patient to ""test-drive"" an implanted FES system. The proof-of-feasibility test lasted 90 days. ""At the end,"" said Bush, of Columbus, Ohio, ""I was walking down the hallway. To me, it was monumental."" A video of him walking with and without the system can be found at: https:/ / youtu. be/ 17JYaKkdRYs .

McGlynn, 69, of North Royalton, Ohio, could walk with a cane, but not easily. With the technology switched on, he covered far more ground and his pace was twice as fast during his 30-week study.

""It's helped with balance and confidence,"" said McGlynn, who used to tread a lot of stairs maintaining equipment at a steel plant. ""I'm confident now that I can walk without stumbling and falling."" A video of him walking with and without aid of the system can be found here: https:/ / youtu. be/ 3CYq-FSFQLM .

Nathan Makowski, an investigator at the Cleveland FES Center, created by Case Western Reserve and the Cleveland VA, said that FES technology has been used primarily for therapy in stroke patients in the past. ""This, though, is a more long-term assistive system,"" he said.

Addressing needs

The researchers hope these studies will lay the foundation for implanted systems that restore some independence to people with MS or who have suffered a stroke.

Their numbers are substantial. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society estimates that more than 2.3 million people have the disease worldwide. Surveys have found that 93 percent suffer gait impairment within 10 years of diagnosis and 13 percent report they are unable to walk twice a week. Other research has found that 6 million to 7 million people live with stroke nationally and nearly 30 percent require assistance to walk.

""In both cases, there is a disconnect between the brain and muscles,"" said Stephen Selkirk, MD, a neurologist at the VA's Spinal Cord Injury Division and assistant professor of neurology at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine. ""This system replaces the lost connection.""

The system includes implanted electrodes that tie into nerves that control muscles collectively, called hip and knee flexors and ankle dorsoflexors. In healthy people, the muscles work in seamless coordination each step they take.

When Bush or McGlynn walks, he pushes a button on an external controller, which sends signals to a pulse generator, which then sends electrical pulses to the electrodes. The pulses stimulate the nerves, which in turn stimulate the muscles in both of Bush's legs and McGlynn's left leg.

""Both guys were taking steps the first time we turned the systems on,"" said Ron Triolo, a professor of orthopaedics and biomedical engineering at Case Western Reserve and executive director of the Advanced Platform Technology (APT) Center. ""When Robert Bush took a step, it wasn't' pretty, but we saw the potential.""

In each patient, ""the pulses are sent in a pattern that is close to how normal muscles work,"" said Rudi Kobetic, a principal investigator at the Stokes Cleveland VA and APT Center. ""We try to time the pattern to stimulation so that it's integrated with their ability. Similar to regular physical therapy, we can see results.""

Significant improvement

Both men gained strength and endurance through repeated use of the systems and fine-tuning by the researchers.

Bush went from the two steps to consistently walking more than 30 yards during the trial. In that time, he used a walker to help maintain his balance.

""When they turned it on the first time, I was surprised how well it worked,"" said Bush, who had to give up his construction career due to the disease. ""I lifted my knee like I was high-stepping. Once we got it fine-tuned and I got walking, I thought it was amazing. I still think it's amazing.""

McGlynn's gait became noticeably more symmetrical and energetic, the researchers said. His gait without the system was about 19 yards per minute; with the system, 47 yards per minute. Training with the system improved McGlynn's speed when it was turned off to 23 yards per minute, indicating therapeutic benefit.

""Distance is a challenge,"" he said. Initially, he could walk 83 yards but improved to 1,550 yards--nearly a mile--at the faster gait. ""I work up a good sweat and that makes me feel good,"" he said.

Due to his improvements, the research team is developing a system that McGlynn can use at home and outside.

""I'll be able to walk for exercise and hopefully be able to walk into church and into a restaurant,"" McGlynn said.

When Bush's trial ended, surgeons removed his implanted electrodes. The researchers are seeking funding to fit him with a permanent FES system in a clinical trial.

In the meantime, Bush is now back to using a wheelchair but working to maintain his strength and flexibility, repeatedly standing and sitting while holding onto a rail or standing for long periods of time. ""I'm keeping things ready for when they get the green light,"" he said.

"A team of researchers from Cleveland Clinic, Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center, Kaiser Permanente Northwest, and other clinical sites have demonstrated that a new blood test known as IsoPSA detects prostate cancer more precisely than current tests in two crucial measures - distinguishing cancer from benign conditions, and identifying patients with high-risk disease.

By identifying molecular changes in the prostate specific antigen (PSA) protein, the findings, published online last month by European Urology, suggest that once validated, use of IsoPSA may substantially reduce the need for biopsy, and may thus lower the likelihood of overdetection and overtreatment of nonlethal prostate cancer.

The research team, led by Cleveland Clinic's Eric Klein, M.D., conducted a multicenter prospective study of 261 men scheduled for prostate biopsy at five academic and community centers in the U.S. enrolled between August 2015 and December 2016.

""Despite criticism, PSA has transformed the landscape of early detection, screening, and management of prostate cancer in the last few decades,"" said Dr. Klein, chair of Cleveland Clinic's Glickman Urological & Kidney Institute. ""Unfortunately, PSA is tissue-specific but not cancer-specific, leading to overdiagnosis and overtreatment of biologically insignificant cancers, which is widely recognized as a key limitation in its clinical utility.""

The study directly compared the clinical performance of a new test based on PSA, called IsoPSA, to PSA itself with patients already scheduled for prostate biopsy. IsoPSA proved significantly superior to PSA in two key indications: discriminating between prostate cancer and benign conditions; and identifying patients with high-grade disease. The former indication is potentially useful for using IsoPSA for screening by primary care physicians, while the second is helpful for urologists in identifying patients who would benefit from curative intent therapy and other applications.

The results show that if validated and adopted clinically, IsoPSA could significantly reduce the rate of unnecessary biopsies by almost 50 percent. ""The methodology used in the IsoPSA assay represents a significant departure from conventional ways to define biomarkers in blood, and may be applicable to improving other cancer biomarkers,"" said Dr. Klein.

""Due to its inherent simplicity, requiring only a blood draw and presenting information to the physician in familiar context using a single number - just like PSA itself - we are quite hopeful in IsoPSA's future utility after further validation studies,"" said Mark Stovsky, M.D., co-author and staff member, Cleveland Clinic Glickman Urological & Kidney Institute.

The procedure, called a prostatic urethral lift, does not improve flow as much as surgery, in which a physician cuts away some of the inside of the prostate to allow better flow. But the lift procedure and recovery are much quicker, with no hospital stay and fewer complications. And patients who get the sutures can always come back for surgery later.

"A daily supplement of pharmaceutical grade chondroitin is as good as celecoxib (Celebrex) at relieving arthritic knee pain and doesn’t have dangerous side effects, researchers say.

Dr. Jean-Yves Reginster of Liege State University in Belgium and colleagues recruited 604 people over age 50 with knee osteoarthritis from five European countries and randomly assigned them to take 800 mg of the extra-pure chondroitin sulfate (Chondrosulf), 200 mg of celecoxib (Celebrex) or a placebo every day for six months.

Those who took chondroitin sulfate or celecoxib had similar levels of pain relief at the end of the study, and in both groups the improvement was greater than for those taking just a placebo, according to the report in Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases.

Reginster told Reuters Health the findings are in line with earlier studies showing pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin sulfate could significantly decrease the progression of knee osteoarthritis over a period of three years.

He stressed that pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin is not the same as over-the-counter supplements, which are made differently and can’t get into the joint in high enough concentrations to combat the causes of cartilage degradation and pain.

European regulatory bodies recommend pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin sulfate as well as pharmaceutical-grade glucosamine sulfate as first-line treatments for osteoarthritis, Reginster said by email, because of the side effects associated with celecoxib and other non-steroidal inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including stomach ulcers, bleeding, liver and kidney problems.

Dr. Michael Shepard of Hoag Orthopedic Institute in Orange, California, noted that the study had a relatively low number of participants and that most U.S. studies of this type would run two years rather than six months.

In addition, U.S.-based studies of chondroitin have had mixed results, said Shepard, who wasn’t involved in the study. Some have found the supplements to be as effective as ibuprofen (also an NSAID), and some have found that chondroitin sulfate is no more effective than placebo, he told Reuters Health.

“I tell my patients, ‘buyer beware,’” Shepard said in an email. “I tell them about the mixed results of chondroitin in the literature. I tell them to try chondroitin for one month as a trial and if they like it and feel better with it, then keep taking it.”

If chondroitin doesn’t work for them, he suggests taking an NSAID “periodically,” and to be aware of the side effects.

“If you are going to stay on an NSAID for a prolonged period then you need regular follow up with your doctor,” Shepard cautioned.

Dr. Rachel Wolfe of Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, agreed that chondroitin is “reasonable to try” for some people, especially those with contraindications to NSAIDs.

“However, it should not replace other therapy such as quad strengthening exercises, and weight loss, which we know will provide benefit. It should be used in conjunction with these measures,” said Wolfe, who wasn’t involved in the study.

“Chondroitin is not a miracle pill, but if it allows people to feel less pain and be more active, thereby losing weight and strengthening muscles, then I think there may benefit,” Wolfe told Reuters Health by email. “Studies like this highlight that medicine is still an art - we do not have perfect answers, and we have to individualize for each patient.”

The study was sponsored by IBSA Institut Biochimique SA, a pharmaceutical company based in Lugano, Switzerland, that makes the chondroitin sulfate supplements used in the test.

"A vaccine that blocks the high from heroin has just moved one step closer to reality.

The compound, created by chemists at the Scripps Research Institute, works in a way that’s similar to other vaccines. By introducing the immune system to a potential future enemy, antibodies against that invader are ready to attack when the time comes. In this case, the vaccine introduces a piece of the heroin molecule to the immune system. In response, this protective system manufactures antibodies to the drug, including the components that cause the high.

As a result, those molecules never reach the brain, preventing the euphoria that may have otherwise resulted. The absence of a high could help recovering heroin users resist the temptation to relapse, the researchers say.

The current study of the vaccine, published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, follows eight years of laboratory research and studies in rodents that indicated the compound could neutralize heroin at different doses.

Here, the Scripps investigators, working with researchers at Virginia Commonwealth University, tested the vaccine on four rhesus monkeys. The animals were given three doses of the vaccine, which elicited a successful immune response that neutralized heroin given at varying doses. The high-blocking effects of the vaccine were strongest during the first month but continued for more than eight months. The researchers did not observe any harmful side effects from the intervention.

Two of the animals had been exposed to the vaccine seven months before for a similar pilot study. All four monkeys responded to the vaccine, but the two that were receiving it a second time had a stronger response, hinting that their immune systems were already primed with the “memory” of the compound.

Mark Thomas, who researches addiction at the University of Minnesota Health Sciences, says that a vaccine like this could help a former heroin abuser, “forge a path to abstinence.” Thomas, who was not involved with the study, explains that he was initially wary of the vaccine approach. He figured that a person who is dependent on drugs would find a replacement if heroin no longer caused a high.

“It’s not going to be a panacea,” says Thomas. But in light of the growing drug abuse epidemic, for which, he says, “we have so few tools,” adding a vaccine to the available treatments could help. “It’s an avenue that shows some promise.”

Although research on humans is not yet planned, study authors Kim Janda and Paul Bremer, chemists at the Scripps Research Institute, are encouraged about this next step. Other anti-heroin vaccines have proved ineffective for people, but this compound is the first to work in primates. “We believe this vaccine candidate will prove safe for human trials,” said Janda in a statement.

Importantly, this vaccine is designed to work against only heroin, not other opioids. Bremer and Janda now hope to find a company interested in conducting a human study so that the vaccine can become commercially available.

"Cochlear implants that have electrodes designed without wire perform better than those with wires for long-term hearing preservation, a Mount Sinai researcher has reported in a first-of-its-kind study. The research also determined that the best surgical approach for cochlear implant procedures did not involve drilling into the bone around the ear. The results, published in the June 23, 2017, online edition of The Laryngoscope, may transform how doctors approach cochlear implant procedures to give patients the best possible outcomes.

Cochlear implants help preserve hearing in patients with nerve deafness who cannot benefit from hearing aids. They are surgically placed in the inner ear to convert sound waves into electrical signals that stimulate the auditory nerve to provide hearing.

""This is the largest clinical study done in the world on conventional electrodes and will have major implications for doctors and their patients who need their long-term hearing restored,"" said the study's lead investigator, George Wanna, MD, Site Chair, Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai (NYEE) and Mount Sinai Beth Israel; Chief, Division of Otology-Neurotology and Director of the Center for Hearing and Balance and Ear Institute at Mount Sinai Health System. ""This study is a breakthrough for patients with hearing loss, and improvements in practice and techniques will allow them to enjoy many hearing benefits such as music enjoyment, listening in complex environments, and sound localization.""

Dr. Wanna and a team of researchers from Vanderbilt University examined roughly 230 patients with every type of cochlear implant, including three FDA-approved implants that use different types of electrodes to stimulate the auditory nerve. They found that electrodes designed with no wire (called lateral wall electrodes) performed the best in maintaining residual hearing in the inner ear, compared to electrodes made with wire. More specifically, the non-wire electrodes were less traumatic, causing less injury and minimizing fractures inside the inner ear. The study found that the actual brand of the electrode did not make a difference; the presence or absence of wire was the only distinguishing factor.

Dr. Wanna and the researchers also looked at the impact of two major surgical approaches used to insert the electrodes in the inner ear: ""round window"" (where surgeons open the membrane without bone removal or drilling in the inner ear) and ""cochleostomy"" (which requires drilling into the bone to get inside the inner ear). They reported that patients who had the round window approach had a much better chance of keeping their residual hearing in the long term.

""The cochleostomy approach causes fibrosis and scarring, leading to hearing loss over time,"" said Dr. Wanna. ""Our results also revealed that using oral steroids also helped in the long term to preserve hearing by preventing inflammation.""

""We hope the findings will help surgeons choose the best implants and approaches for their patients,"" said Dr. Wanna. ""This is an exciting time in this field, and the advancement in hearing technology and continued improvements in techniques and outcomes will benefit patients and their families.""

"George Burke has a talent for tossing back his daily cocktail — which contains vitamins, minerals, muscle-building compounds, some little-known research drugs and a microdose of LSD — in almost a single gulp. It’s a weird but handy trick for someone who swallows 25 pills a day, most of them purchases off the Internet.

Burke credits the regimen with giving him the cognitive edge he needs to thrive in California’s Silicon Valley, where he’s the co-founder of a food service that caters to athletes and fitness devotees.

He used to get his edge from Adderall, but after moving from New Jersey to San Francisco, he says, he couldn’t find a doctor who would write him a prescription. Driven to the Internet, he discovered a world of cognition-enhancing drugs known as nootropics — some prescription, some over-the-counter, others available on a worldwide gray market of private sellers — said to improve memory, attention, creativity and motivation.

“It’s not like every tech worker in Silicon Valley is taking nootropics to get ahead,” Burke acknowledges. “It’s the few who are getting ahead who are using supplements to do that.”

The word “nootropic” was coined in 1972 by a Romanian scientist, Corneliu Giurgea, who combined the Greek words for “mind” and “bending.” Caffeine and nicotine can be considered mild nootropics, while prescription Ritalin, Adderall and Provigil (modafinil, a drug for treating narcolepsy) lie at the far end of the spectrum when prescribed off-label as cognitive enhancers. Even microdosing of LSD is increasingly viewed as a means to greater productivity.

But when aficionados talk about nootropics, they usually refer to substances that have supposedly few side effects and low toxicity. Most often they mean piracetam, which Giurgea first synthesized in 1964 and which is approved for therapeutic use in dozens of countries for use in adults and the elderly. Not so in the United States, however, where officially it can be sold only for research purposes.

Piracetam is well studied and is credited by its users with boosting their memory, sharpening their focus, heightening their immune system, even bettering their personalities. But it’s only one of many formulations in the racetam drug family. Newer ones include aniracetam, phenylpiracetam and oxiracetam. All are available online, where their efficacy and safety are debated and reviewed on message boards and in podcasts.

Using ‘stacks’

A number of companies now market nootropic “stacks,” or formulas, some of which include piracetam, herbal remedies, amino acids and citicoline, a naturally occurring brain chemical that can be taken orally as a supplement, intravenously or as a shot.

Because they are sold as nutritional supplements and natural products that refrain from making health claims, they avoid close government scrutiny.

When Burke began ordering piracetam online five years ago, it arrived in baggies filled with white powder. “It was as if I was buying coke off the street,” he recalls. These days, he buys his stack from Nootroo, a San Francisco company.

But self-experimenters such as Burke often don’t restrict themselves to medication alone. Dedicated brain hackers, as they call themselves, are willing to exploit their own biology to try to sharpen their mind. Their methods include meditation, cold-water plunges, periodic fasting and high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets.

“Who doesn’t want to maximize their cognitive ability? Who doesn’t want to maximize their muscle mass?” asks Murali Doraiswamy, who has led several trials of cognitive enhancers at Duke University Health System and has been an adviser to pharmaceutical and supplement manufacturers as well as the Food and Drug Administration. He attributes the demand to an increasingly knowledge-based society that values mental quickness and agility above all else.

But while some studies have found short-term benefits, Doraiswamy says there is no evidence that what are commonly known as smart drugs — of any type — improve thinking or productivity over the long run. “There’s a sizable demand, but the hype around efficacy far exceeds available evidence,” notes Doraiswamy, adding that, for healthy young people such as Silicon Valley go-getters, “it’s a zero-sum game. That’s because when you up one circuit in the brain, you’re probably impairing another system.”

Short-term benefits?

Early studies attributed a lot of short-term benefits to nootropics — so much so that in 1983, Russian scientists turned to phenylpiracetam to boost the physical and mental performance of cosmonauts during space flight.

A 1999 study found that piracetam had beneficial effects on the hippocampal membranes of patients with Alzheimer’s disease. The hippocampus, an area of the brain that plays a key role in the formation of new memories, typically shows severe shrinkage with Alzheimer’s. The idea that piracetam might reverse that effect was exciting.

Although piracetam has a history of “relatively few side effects,” it has fallen far short of its initial promise for treating any of the illnesses associated with cognitive decline, according to Lon Schneider, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California. “We don’t use it at all and never have.”

As for newer nootropic drugs, there are unknown risks. “Piracetam has been studied for decades,” says cognitive neuroscientist Andrew Hill, the founder of a neurofeedback company in Los Angeles called Peak Brain Institute. But “some of [the newer] compounds are things that some random editor found in a scientific article, copied the formula down and sent it to China and had a bulk powder developed three months later that they’re selling. Please don’t take it, people!”

For Burke and other brain hackers, the evidence for nootropics is strong enough.

Burke, who begins each morning with a Bulletproof coffee — a rich brew of caffeine with dollops of butter and coconut oil — has created a San Francisco meetup group called Peak Performance “to teach all my friends in the tech space about life hacks so they can kick a--better every day.”

Last spring, 100 people showed up at a Peak Performance event where psychedelic psychologist James Fadiman said the key to unleashing the cognition-enhancing effects of LSD — which he listed as less anxiety, better focus, improved sleep, greater creativity — was all in the dosage. He recommended a tenth of a “party dose” — enough to give you “the glow” and enhance your cognitive powers without “the trip.”

Burke says he definitely got the glow. “The first time I took it, I was working on a business plan. I had to juggle multiple contingencies in my head, and for some reason a tree with branches jumped into my head. I was able to place each contingency on a branch, retract and go back to the trunk, and in this visual way I was able to juggle more information.”

The effects of fasting

Not all brain hacking involves taking a pill, though.

Nootrobox, a San Francisco company that markets a nootropic mix of vitamins, minerals and amino acids, promotes fasting as a way to energize brain and body.

“We stumbled upon fasting as a way to optimize cognition and make yourself into a more efficient human being,” says Manuel Lam, an internal medicine physician who advises Nootrobox on clinical issues. He and members of the company’s executive team have implanted glucose monitors in their arms — not because they fear diabetes but because they wish to track the real-time effect of the foods they eat.

“Fasting forces your body to deplete its glucose storage and trains it to look inside for fuel,” Lam enthuses. “It’s like being strapped to a solar panel. The sun is always shining on you.”

Nootrobox employees are encouraged to fast every Tuesday, then meet for breakfast on Wednesday at a local diner. Founded by two Stanford University computer graduates, the company has initiated an international fasting group on Facebook; at last count, there were 3,500 members.

Research on animals has shown that intermittent fasting — limiting caloric intake at least two days a week — can help improve neural connections in the hippocampus and protect against the accumulation of plaque, a protein prevalent in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease. Research has also shown that intermittent fasting helped reduce anxiety in mice.

Mark Mattson, chief of the Laboratory of Neurosciences at the National Institute on Aging, has overseen a lot of the animal studies on fasting and is impressed with the evidence — so much so that he has personally adopted a regimen of intermittent fasting.

“There’s pretty conclusive evidence from animal studies that intermittent fasting is beneficial for brain function and resistance to aging from neurogenerative diseases,” he says.

Fasting has been deployed since the ancient Greeks to fast-track learning. As Plato is said to have stated, “I fast for greater physical and mental efficiency.” The philosopher Pythagoras reportedly demanded that his students fast 40 days before attending his lectures.

Far easier to take a pill.

Looking for an edge

Vinh Ngo, a San Francisco family practice doctor who specializes in hormone therapy, has become familiar with piracetam and other nootropics through a changing patient base. His office is located in the heart of the city’s tech boom and he is increasingly sought out by young, male tech workers who tell him they are interested in cognitive enhancement.

Ngo has experimented with piracetam himself (“The first time I tried it, I thought, ‘Wow, this is pretty strong for a supplement.’ I had a little bit of reflux, heartburn, but in general it was a cognitive enhancer. . . . I found it helpful”) and the neurotransmitter DMEA (“You have an idea, it helps you finish the thought. It’s for when people have difficulty finishing that last connection in the brain”).

But he has also seen patients whose propensity for self-experimentation to improve cognition got out of hand. One chief executive he treated, Ngo said, developed an unhealthy predilection for albuterol, because he felt the asthma inhaler medicine kept him alert and productive long after others had quit working. Unfortunately, the drug ended up severely imbalancing his electrolytes, which can lead to dehydration, headaches, vision and cardiac problems, muscle contractions and, in extreme cases, seizures.

“There is that culture here [in Silicon Valley] that relies on being smarter than your own self,” Ngo says. “People want to find an edge over their competitor — that’s how they got their position in the first place. I’m trying to give them a little more wiggle room — but in a safe way.”

He says he screens his patients for addiction and cardiovascular problems and creates individual treatment plans based on their health histories and blood tests.

There’s no one-size-fits-all approach. “I don’t have a rubber stamp for everyone, and not everyone is a candidate” for cognitive enhancement, says Ngo, who requires that his patients sign waivers acknowledging possible health risks in taking nootropics.

If, for example, someone decides to go on medication — be it Adderall, albuterol or piracetam — the patient must understand that there is a risk for high blood pressure and heart problems.

“I want to empower them,” Ngo says, but “there’s a fine line between empowering them to make their own health decisions and staying healthy.”

"STOCKHOLM, June 15, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --

Elekta (EKTA-B.ST) today announced new data demonstrating stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a safe treatment option for early-stage lung cancer patients aged 80 or older. The results, which were based on data from more than 1,000 patients across five institutions that comprise the Elekta Lung Research Group, are available online and will be published in the July 15 print issue of International Journal of Radiation Oncology • Biology • Physics.

The study evaluated safety and efficacy outcomes of 1,083 patient reports collected in a multi-institutional database. Patients were treated with SBRT for early-stage lung cancer between 2004 and 2014 and followed for a median of 1.7 years. The cohort included 305 patients under 70 years of age, 448 patients ages 70 to 79 years, and 330 patients aged 80 years or more (which included 16 patients aged 90 years or more). The median age was 75 years (range 41to 94).

Study results show no significant differences among the three age groups with respect to 2-year local recurrence, regional recurrence, distant metastases or the incidence of grade 3 or higher toxicity. Cause-specific survival was similar among all three age groups (90.3 to 90.6 percent). Two-year overall survival was lower in older patients, which is likely related to other medical issues.

""Older patients are often not considered for radiation therapy due to concerns about their ability to tolerate treatment. The results of our study clearly support the use of SBRT for elderly patients, especially those who may not be able to tolerate longer courses of radiotherapy or more invasive treatment options,"" says Meredith Giuliani, MBBS, FRCPC, MEd, a radiation oncologist in the Cancer Clinical Research Unit at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network in Toronto and lead study author. ""Radiation oncologists need to work closely with our peers in other parts of the medical community to ensure that patients with diagnosed or suspected early-lung cancer are evaluated for potential treatment with SBRT regardless of age.""

""This study is the largest series of its type to evaluate SBRT outcomes in patients aged 80 years and older,"" says Joel Goldwein, MD, Senior Vice President, Medical Affairs for Elekta. ""In addition to providing important support for using SBRT to treat early-stage lung cancer in elderly patients, these findings highlight the value of multi-institutional collaborations and large data sets that can provide statistically meaningful answers to critical questions about treatment outcome and guide clinical decision making.""

The Elekta Lung Research Group (ELRG) is an international collaboration of physicians and physicists that is evaluating clinical outcomes in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer patients. To date, they have accumulated data on close to 1,200 such patients and identified medical and technical factors that affect tumor control and toxicity. Their collective experience is among the largest multinational series of patients treated with image-guided SBRT to date.

The ELRG includes participants from William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan; Princess Margaret Cancer Centre; Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Julius-Maximilians University of Würzburg in Würzburg, Germany; and The Netherlands Cancer Institute-Antoni van Leeuwenhoek hospital in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

MONDAY, June 19, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Acupuncture is a safe and effective alternative to pain medications for some emergency room patients, a new study reports.

""While acupuncture is widely used by practitioners in community settings for treating pain, it is rarely used in hospital emergency departments,"" said study lead investigator Marc Cohen. He is a professor in the School of Health and Biomedical Sciences at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia.

The study -- billed as the world's largest randomized, controlled trial of acupuncture in the emergency department -- included 528 patients.

The study participants were seen at four Australian emergency departments for acute low back pain, migraines or ankle sprains. Patients who said their level of pain was at least 4 on a 10-point scale received one of three treatments: acupuncture alone; acupuncture with painkillers; or painkillers alone.

One hour after treatment, less than 40 percent of all patients had significant pain reduction, meaning at least a 2-point decline on the 10-point scale. More than 80 percent still had a pain rating of at least 4, the findings showed.

But two days later, most patients were satisfied. Overall, nearly 83 percent of acupuncture-only patients said they would probably or definitely repeat their treatment, compared with about 81 percent in the combined group, and 78 percent who took painkillers alone.

""Emergency nurses and doctors need a variety of pain-relieving options when treating patients, given the concerns around opioids such as morphine, which carry the risk of addiction when used long-term,"" Cohen said in a university news release.

The study results suggest acupuncture would be especially beneficial for patients who can't use standard pain-relieving drugs because of other medical conditions, Cohen added.

But he noted that more research is needed because some patients remained in pain no matter what treatment they received.

The study was published June 18 in the Medical Journal of Australia.

"Scientists have developed a simple three-in-one blood test they believe could transform treatment of advanced prostate cancer, helping to extend or save lives.

The test, developed by researchers at the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) in London and the Royal Marsden NHS foundation trust, picks out men suitable for treatment with olaparib, part of a revolutionary class of drugs called “PARP-inhibitors”, which stops damaged cells from repairing themselves.

The liquid biopsy, less invasive than a tissue biopsy, also detects early signs of resistance to olaparib and monitors the cancer’s evolution over time, according to the paper, published in Cancer Discovery on Monday.

Prof Johann de Bono, Regius professor of cancer research at the ICR, and consultant medical oncologist at the Royal Marsden NHS foundation trust, said: “Our study identifies, for the first time, genetic changes that allow prostate cancer cells to become resistant to the precision medicine olaparib.

“From these findings, we were able to develop a powerful, three-in-one test that could in future be used to help doctors select treatment, check whether it is working and monitor the cancer in the longer term. We think it could be used to make clinical decisions about whether a PARP-inhibitor is working within as little as four to eight weeks of starting therapy.

“Not only could the test have a major impact on treatment of prostate cancer, but it could also be adapted to open up the possibility of precision medicine to patients with other types of cancer as well.”

By testing cancer DNA in the bloodstream, the researchers found they could pick out which men with advanced prostate cancer were likely to benefit from treatment with the drug.



They also used the test to analyse DNA in the blood after treatment had started, so people who were not responding could be identified and switched to alternative therapy in as little as four to eight weeks.

Thirdly, they used the test to monitor a patient’s blood throughout treatment to quickly pick up signs that the cancer was evolving genetically and might be becoming resistant to the drugs.

The researchers collected blood samples from 49 men at the Royal Marsden with advanced prostate cancer enrolled in the phase II clinical trial of olaparib.



The drug is effective at killing cancer cells that have errors in genes which would otherwise keep them healthy. Some patients respond to olaparib for years but in others the treatment can fail early or the cancer can evolve resistance.

The ICR chief executive, Prof Paul Workman, said the test could “usher in a new era of precision medicine for prostate cancer”.

He said: “Blood tests for cancer promise to be truly revolutionary. They are cheap and simple to use, but most importantly, because they aren’t invasive, they can be employed or applied to routinely monitor patients to spot early if treatment is failing – offering patients the best chance of surviving their disease.”

The research was funded by the Prostate Cancer Foundation, Prostate Cancer UK, Movember, Cancer Research UK and the National Institute for Health Research."	Prostate cancer blood test could transform treatment, say scientists	2017-06-19 06:00:00	https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jun/19/prostate-cancer-blood-test-transform-treatment-scientists	story_reviews_00216	fake
"Newswise — TORONTO, June 20, 2017 – In a Canadian first, a medical team has implanted a wireless device inside a heart failure patient, permitting clinicians to monitor the patient’s cardiovascular status – virtually and in real-time – and proactively adjust treatment to prevent costly, potentially unnecessary hospitalization.

“Heart failure is an epidemic that commonly leads to hospitalization,” says Dr. Heather Ross, scientific lead at the Ted Rogers Centre for Heart Research and cardiologist, Peter Munk Cardiac Centre, University Health Network. “Hospitalization is often necessary when patients start to retain fluid, develop congestion and experience shortness of breath. This technology is a way to directly measure how much fluid is in a patient, allowing us to intervene before they develop symptoms of congestion, before they end up in hospital. This is a big game-changer.”

Funded by the Ted Rogers Centre for Heart Research, the device called CardioMEMS™ HF System was successfully implanted by interventional cardiologists at the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre in March 2017. The system features a small butterfly-like sensor that then sits inside the pulmonary artery of a heart failure patient. When the patient lies on an accompanying antenna-equipped pillow device, the sensor provides important data – including the patient’s lung pressure readings to clinicians – via a secure website.

“Never before have we had the ability to obtain a patient’s accurate lung pressure data while they are outside the hospital,” said Meredith Linghorne, nurse practitioner, Peter Munk Cardiac Centre. “Traditionally we’ve relied on a patient describing symptoms, and by then they may have already progressed to the point of hospitalization. With this device, we can see warning signs days in advance, and adjust treatment accordingly.”

The most rapidly rising cardiovascular disease in Canada, heart failure affects close to one million Canadians, and an estimated 26 million people globally. In Canada, heart failure patients stay an average of almost 10 days for each hospital admission, accounting for 1.4 million hospital stays a year. These patients live an average of 2.1 years after diagnosis and cost the Canadian health-care system more than $3 billion annually. About one-quarter of these patients return to hospital within three months, while approximately 50 per cent return to hospital within six months.

The CardioMEMS™ HF System is designed to monitor heart failure patients whose condition is serious but who are not so ill that the technology cannot improve their outcome. The first Canadian patient implanted with the heart monitor will be among 25 patients within the Ted Rogers Centre for Heart Research at the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre to be fitted with the device over the next nine months.

Produced by Abbott, the CardioMEMSÔ HF System is approved in the United States by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and is currently awaiting approval by Health Canada.

"WASHINGTON—An experimental drug is showing promise against an untreatable eye disease that blinds older adults — and intriguingly, it seems to work in patients who carry a particular gene flaw that fuels the damage to their vision.

Age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, is the leading cause of vision loss among seniors, gradually eroding crucial central vision. There are different forms but more than 5 million people worldwide, and a million in the U.S., have an advanced type of so-called “dry” macular degeneration that has no treatment. First patients may notice blurriness when they look straight ahead. Eventually many develop blank spots, becoming legally blind.

“These are seniors who are entering their golden years and now they’ve lost the ability to read, watch television, see their loved ones,” said Dr. Rahul Khurana, a retina specialist and spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology.

The experimental drug, lampalizumab, aims to slow the destruction of light-sensing cells in the retina, creeping lesions that characterize the stage of dry AMD called “geographic atrophy.” When those cells die, they can’t grow back — the vision loss is irreversible.

What the research found

In an 18-month study of 129 patients, monthly eye injections of the drug modestly slowed worsening of the disease when compared with patients given dummy shots. What’s exciting for scientists came next, when researchers from drugmaker Genentech Inc. took a closer look at exactly who was being helped.

It turns out that nearly 6 in 10 of the study’s participants carry a gene variation that makes part of the immune system go awry — a genetic flaw already known to increase the risk of getting macular degeneration in the first place.

Those are the only patients who appeared to benefit from the drug; they had 44 per cent less eye damage than the untreated patients, the Genentech team reported Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine. While the study is too small to prove if lampalizumab really helps maintain vision, that’s a bigger difference than the overall results suggested.

Why would an immune-related gene affect aging eyes?

One arm of the immune system, the complement pathway, helps fight infections by attracting immune cells to attack bacteria.

Normally, there’s a barrier that keeps such cells away from the retina. But that barrier can break down with age, opening sensitive eye cells to harm from the spillover, explained Genentech immunologist Menno van Lookeren Campagne.

Now for the gene connection: Previous studies have linked macular degeneration to gene variations that remove some of that pathway’s natural brakes, so it can become too active.

The hypothesis: Genentech’s drug, lampalizumab, essentially offers a backup method for tamping down the immune reaction. An antibody, it works by inhibiting a particular enzyme named factor D that helps power the immune pathway.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

“We try to reinsert the braking ability,” said study lead author Brian Yaspan, a Genentech senior scientist.

What’s next?

Wednesday’s study detected no safety concerns, clearing the way for Genentech and its parent company Roche to open two large-scale studies that aim to prove if the drug works. Results are expected later this year.

The current research sheds light on how that long-suspected immune culprit might be working, and is “the first suggestion that there may be a treatment for geographic atrophy coming up in the future,” said National Eye Institute retina specialist Dr. Wai Wong, who wasn’t involved in the study.

“It’s a very, very exciting study,” said Khurana, the ophthalmologist association’s spokesman, who also wasn’t part of the research. “From the basic science perspective, it makes a lot of sense.”

Macular degeneration tends to occur after age 60, but it sometimes strikes earlier. According to the National Eye Institute, it’s less common in people who exercise regularly, avoid smoking, and eat a diet high in green leafy vegetables and fish.

Symptoms often aren’t noticeable early on. But several eye tests can detect signs of macular degeneration, including a dilated eye exam and a tool called an Amsler grid with straight lines that may look wavy if the macula, the centre of the retina, is harmed.

Macular degeneration patients often are advised to take certain vitamin combinations that may help stave off advanced disease. And it’s important for patients to know what type they have. While there’s no treatment for the advanced dry form, the “wet” form occurs when leaky blood vessels grow under the retina — and there are several therapies that can help those patients preserve vision."	New drug shows promise against vision-robbing disease in seniors	2017-06-21 06:00:00	https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2017/06/21/new-drug-shows-promise-against-vision-robbing-disease-in-seniors.html	story_reviews_00212	true
"The prospect of resolving nagging knee pain – or discomfort that’s come on fairly sudden – drives many patients to go under the knife, specifically to have an arthroscopic knee procedure done.

During the procedure, an orthopedic surgeon inserts a tiny camera – or arthroscope – through a small incision to view the inside of the knee. The doctor then attempts to surgically address the knee pain, such as making repairs to a torn meniscus – a C-shaped disc that cushions the knee – or realigning a misaligned patella or kneecap.

“There are some limited circumstances where it’s helpful,” says Dr. Reed Siemieniuk, an internist in Toronto and a doctorate student in health research methodology at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. That includes young patients who have sports injuries, or tears in the ligaments of the knee, he says, and patients who have bleeding in the knee – to try to figure out where the bleeding is coming from and address that. The surgery could also benefit individuals of any age who’ve suffered a traumatic injury to the knee, such as a meniscus tear. An example of a good candidate for arthroscopic knee surgery would be a 30-year-old who twists his knee getting up from a seated position or while playing tennis, says Dr. Joseph Bosco, a professor and vice chair of the department of orthopedic surgery at NYU Langone Medical Center.

But a meta-analysis led by Siemieniuk of research on arthroscopic knee surgery strongly recommended against knee scoping “in nearly all patients with degenerative knee disease.” The clinical practice guideline was published in the BMJ in May. The analysis evaluated arthroscopic knee surgery for degenerative knee disease, which is often synonymous with knee arthritis. ""It is knee pain or locking that occurs with use or overuse. The most common risk factor is being overweight or obese,"" Siemieniuk explains. ""We use the term degenerative knee disease rather than arthritis because some surgeons restrict the diagnosis of arthritis to those diagnosed by X-ray or MRI when in reality, many people have degenerative knee disease with normal X-rays and MRIs."" Meniscus tears are also a common finding in those with arthritis, or degenerative knee disease, and are not associated with knee symptoms, but are often used as a reason to operate, he adds.

“In all of those groups of patients, arthroscopic surgery … doesn’t have any long-term benefit for pain or for function or quality of life,” Siemieniuk says. “But it does have some downsides [including] two to six weeks recovery time, and some rare but more serious adverse effects like blood clots that can sometimes be fatal [and] infection.”

The procedure is generally considered safe, but given the lack of evidence demonstrating a long-term benefit in these common scenarios, clinicians and patients should look at other non-surgical options to address knee pain, the researchers assert. The alternatives they cite include losing weight, if a person is overweight, physical therapy, corticoid steroid injections and other types of injections into the joint to treat pain or taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs known as NSAIDs. “Then if it’s severe and it really is interfering with your quality of life and it’s persistent … some people require knee replacement surgery,” Siemieniuk says. “But nowhere along that line should ... arthroscopic surgery, which is even more common, be performed.”

Bosco says he generally agrees with the recommendation set forth, and that it doesn’t change the way he practices. But he emphasizes that each patient has to be treated individually. The recommendation suggests similarly that individual factors and patient values and preferences must be taken into account. The expert panel that created the guidelines published in the BMJ included not only doctors but also several patients who had osteoarthritis, including one who’d had arthroscopic knee surgery.

“Our strong recommendation against arthroscopy reflects a low value on a modest probability (less than 15 percent) of small or very small improvement in short-term pain and function that does not persist to one year, and a higher value on avoiding the burden, postoperative limitations and rare serious adverse effects associated with knee arthroscopy,” the researchers wrote. The panel felt that almost all patients would share these values. “The recommendation is not applicable to patients who do not share these values (that is, those who place a high value on a small, uncertain and transient reduction in pain and function, and a low value on avoiding the burden and postoperative limitation associated with arthroscopy),” the researchers added.

But many arthroscopic surgeries are being done that don’t benefit patients, Siemieniuk stressed. In Ontario, approximately 90 percent of arthroscopic surgeries are performed for degenerative knee disease, he says. Though he adds that it’s difficult to know exactly what proportion of arthroscopic knee surgeries were for degenerative knee disease in the United States, the researchers reported that arthroscopic procedures for degenerative knee disease cost more than $3 billion per year in the U.S. alone, according to previous research. Citing other studies, they report that arthroscopic knee surgery for degenerative knee disease is the most common orthopedic procedure in countries where data is available and that more than 2 million procedures are done annually worldwide.

Despite the concern that many arthroscopic surgeries are being performed on patients who won’t benefit, some clinicians say these type of guidelines have already been adopted by many surgeons.

The new recommendation comes as no surprise, says Dr. Alejandro Gonzalez Della Valle, a hip and knee surgeon at Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City. “For a number of years, we have known, that if we offer arthroscopic surgery to patients who have moderate or severe arthritis, they generally don’t do well in the long-term,” he says.

Frequently patients with lots of arthritis in the knee also have torn meniscus. But performing arthroscopic surgery won’t relieve a patient of the discomfort from the underlying arthritis. “Fixing the torn meniscus will not cure the patient’s pain,” he says. “Under those conditions, the surgery will not be useful or effective or will not provide any benefit to the patient.”

On the other hand, some patients have very minimal arthritis in the knee, and a very severe meniscal tear producing a lot of pain. “In our clinical impression, those patients can do well for several years with arthroscopic surgery,” he says. “So it’s all about patient selection at the end of the day.” For ideal arthroscopic candidates – like those who suffer a traumatic or sports-related meniscal tear, who have no arthritis – arthroscopic surgery can provide a permanent fix."

"MERIDEN, Conn., June 22, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Protein Sciences Corporation announced the publication of clinical trial results comparing Flublok® Quadrivalent – the quadrivalent version of Flublok® influenza vaccine – to a traditional egg-based quadrivalent inactivated vaccine. The data published in the June 22nd issue of the New England Journal of Medicine showed that Flublok Quadrivalent provided significantly improved protection against laboratory confirmed influenza illness in older adults.

The publication notes that approximately 9,000 people aged 50 and older were enrolled and randomized in an efficacy study designed to compare Flublok Quadrivalent to a traditional quadrivalent vaccine. People who were given Flublok Quadrivalent were over 40% less likely to develop culture-confirmed influenza. This data satisfies both pre-specified criteria for non-inferiority and superiority of Flublok over the traditional egg-based quadrivalent inactivated vaccine. Flublok Quadrivalent was approved by the FDA in October 2016 and will be available nationwide in prefilled syringes for the upcoming flu season.

""This study shows that Flublok® Quadrivalent, produced with modern recombinant technology can provide better protection against confirmed influenza-like illness among older adults than standard-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine produced with traditional technology,"" said Lisa Dunkle MD, Chief Medical Officer of Protein Sciences. ""We demonstrated statistically significantly better protection by Flublok based on considerably fewer people contracting the flu after vaccination with Flublok Quadrivalent. Today, we announce that these peer-reviewed results have been published in the highly respected New England Journal of Medicine. Furthermore, physicians are eligible for up to 1 hour AMA PRA category 1 CME credit for reading the article. Clearly, Flublok represents a major step forward in combating influenza on a global scale.""

Flublok is the only flu vaccine made without the use of eggs and therefore is not subject to the mutations that are sometimes introduced into the vaccine during the process of egg adaptation that can cause the traditional vaccines to be ineffective (see Skowronski et al. (2014) PLOS ONE 9(3), e92153). Flublok contains three times more active ingredients than traditional vaccines and produced significantly higher immune responses to the A strains of influenza (especially H3N2) in the Flublok Quadrivalent study. Furthermore, Flublok Quadrivalent is the first and only high antigen-content quadrivalent flu vaccine that with its high efficacy makes it ideal for older adults and those with a compromised immune system. Flublok is highly purified and does not contain influenza virus, antibiotics, formaldehyde, preservatives, egg protein, latex, gluten or gelatin unlike other flu vaccines. Flublok Quadrivalent is FDA approved for adults 18 and older.

About Flublok®

Flublok, the world's first recombinant protein-based vaccine for the prevention of seasonal influenza disease, is approved for all adults over 18 years. FDA approved the quadrivalent formulation (""Flublok Quadrivalent"") in October 2016 that will be commercially available for everyone over 18 years for the 2017/18 influenza season. Flublok is the only flu vaccine made in a 100% egg-free system using modern cell culture technology, making it unnecessary to use an infectious influenza virus, antibiotics or harsh chemicals (e.g., formaldehyde) in manufacturing. Flublok is highly purified and does not contain any preservatives (e.g., thimerosal - a form of mercury), egg proteins, gelatin or latex. In addition, Flublok contains three times more antigen than traditional flu vaccines (3x45mcg hemagglutinin protein versus 3x15mcg hemagglutinin protein). In a 2014/15 post-marketing study of 9,000 adults 50 years and older, people who received Flublok were over 40% less likely to develop cell culture confirmed influenza than people who received a traditional flu vaccine. Flublok is an exact copy of the influenza virus coat protein and is not subject to the egg-adapted mutations associated with low vaccine effectiveness (see Skowronski et al. (2014) PLOS ONE 9(3), e92153).

"The World Health Organization estimates that more than 300 million people suffer from clinical depression world-wide. But cost, time, stigma, distance to travel, language barriers and other factors prevent many from seeking help.

Now, a growing group of health-care providers are betting that technology—from web-based courses to mobile apps that send prompts via text—can help bridge that gap.

It might seem surprising, since therapy, more than many other kinds of medicine, is so focused on the relationship between patient and therapist. But research, including a meta-analysis of studies involving internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT, suggests that digital therapies augmented by coaches who are available by text or phone can be as effective as evidence-based traditional therapy in treating some people with depression.

One study, funded by the National Institutes of Health and involving 99 patients with moderate depression, found that 90 of them completed a full eight-week course that included access to a suite of treatment apps and text support from coaches with at least a bachelor’s degree in psychology. On average, those who completed the course experienced a significant decrease in symptoms of depression, with three-fourths meeting the criteria for full remission. On average, participants used the apps more than 195 times over two months and interacted with a coach about twice a week.

Elsewhere, a study by the U.K. National Health Service, based on 1.2 million referrals for depression and anxiety, showed that computerized CBT administered to people with depression yielded a recovery rate of 58.4%, compared with 53.9% for those undergoing several types of in-person therapy. Ricardo F. Muñoz, a professor and founder of the Institute for International Internet Interventions for Health at Palo Alto University, who wasn’t involved in the research, says that while patients with more severe depression may be more likely to seek in-person therapy, “the fact that much mild or clinical depression can be successfully treated with computerized CBT is of note.”

Clinical psychologists put the first digital interventions for depression online about 15 years ago, according to Stephen Schueller, an assistant professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University and a member of Northwestern’s Center for Behavioral Intervention Technologies. “We basically thought, if it works in a self-help book, it will work online,” he says. But what they found was that it was difficult to motivate patients with depression to engage regularly with what were essentially online PowerPoint presentations.

Over the past five years, online therapies have evolved to include mobile apps such as Joyable, Lantern and Ginger.io, which are more personalized and responsive. They typically ask users to enter information about their moods and behaviors, then offer problem-solving suggestions, prompts to help patients retrain responses to negative situations, and daily health tips.

Dr. Schueller believes digital interventions need to continue evolving with technology to remain effective. “The future is trying to better understand how to make these apps and sites engaging,” he says. “That will include clinical psychologists working with experts in augmented reality, virtual reality and gaming to develop mobile solutions that are truly novel.”

One such tool might look like Koko, an online messaging chatbot that uses the internet community to address emotional distress. With Koko, a user puts in a negative thought, like ‘I’m stupid,’ and sends it out to other people who may be working through similar situations, Dr. Schueller says. “The crowd creates responses, which go through the system and come back to you as a new message: ‘Maybe you didn’t fail because you’re stupid, but maybe because you didn’t sleep enough or you didn’t study enough.’ ”

The idea is that the crowd “can provide many different ideas that, when combined, might produce better or more creative solutions” than a therapist can, says Dr. Schueller, adding that Koko also uses machine learning to identify those in need of more direct intervention or support.

Lynn Bufka, associate executive director of practice research and policy at the American Psychological Association, says research has demonstrated that individuals can benefit from a range of technology-enabled services. As such, she would like to see a more “stepped” approach to mental-health care for individual patients.

Jessica Caldwell uses the mobile therapy platform Talkspace to text and video chat with her (licensed) therapist. We sat in on one of their sessions to see how technology is transforming the practice. Photo/Video: Drew Evans/The Wall Street Journal.

Stepped care might start with a brief in-person assessment of a patient who shows signs of depression, so that therapists can identify any behavioral or health concerns, says Dr. Bufka, who believes that a human should always be involved at the beginning of a treatment process. “Then, depending on severity, we would provide each patient with a self-help book or access to web-based education. If that didn’t work, perhaps we’d move to a computer-assisted intervention, and then move toward in-person treatment,” either group or individual sessions, Dr. Bufka says. The stepped-care system exists in the U.K., she says, where providers in the National Health Service identify patients with moderate depression and other problems and offer self-help or technology-enabled services. “I think we’ll ultimately see a combination of different online interventions” for depression, she says.

Dr. Muñoz of Palo Alto University says he also believes that therapeutic and preventive services for depression could fall on a continuum.

The challenge for the public is knowing which digital tools to trust, he says, pointing to PsyberGuide, a website headed by Dr. Schueller that uses a standardized rating system to help consumers select products and apps for various mental-health conditions, as a good model.

Eventually, Dr. Muñoz envisions something he calls massive open online interventions, where therapeutic and preventive services could be delivered virtually to anyone in the world, in any language, at any time—ideally at no charge to users. The only barrier to entry would be internet access. Once the technology is built and more people use it, he says, the marginal cost of providing that intervention to one more person would gradually approach zero.

He points to a study he conducted in which 15,170 smokers from around the world participated in a free online smoking-cessation program offered in English and Spanish. After 12 months, 3,479 users, or 23%, reported they had quit smoking; to help that many people quit using more common care, he says, health providers would have had to give nicotine patches to 17,395 smokers, at a cost of $3.65 million.

His program, which had been built with earlier research grants, cost a total of $200,000 to maintain and advertise the website world-wide for 30 months.

“With the political will and across-the-board standards, we can give an intervention to anyone, even people who don’t have access to a mental-health clinic or antidepressants,” he says. “All they need is access to a smartphone with a data plan.”

HealthDay Reporter

WEDNESDAY, June 28, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Something as simple as taking a low-dose aspirin every day may protect pregnant women from the life-threatening condition known as preeclampsia, new research suggests.

""Preeclampsia is one of the most serious complications of pregnancy, with a high risk of death for the mother and baby,"" said senior study author Dr. Kypros Nicolaides. He is a professor of fetal medicine at Kings College Hospital in London.

But he added, ""This condition is, to a great extent, preventable.""

The new study looked at an aspirin dose of 150 milligrams (mg) per day because some past studies with smaller daily doses of aspirin have produced conflicting results, according to Nicolaides. A baby aspirin dose is 81 milligrams.

In those studies using smaller doses, the reduction in preeclampsia risk hovered around 10 percent, he said, but the higher dose in this latest study was linked to a 62 percent reduction in risk.

Preeclampsia is a serious high blood pressure disorder. It can affect all of the organs in a woman's body, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). The exact cause of the disorder is unknown, but certain risk factors make it more likely to occur, including:

A past history of preeclampsia,

Being pregnant with more than one baby,

Having longstanding high blood pressure,

Having chronic conditions, such as type 1 or type 2 diabetes, autoimmune disease and kidney problems.

Dr. Mitchell Kramer, chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Huntington Hospital in New York, said he'd add women who are severely obese and women who've had babies who had restricted growth to the list of women at high risk of preeclampsia.

ACOG already recommends that women who are at high risk of preeclampsia take a low-dose baby aspirin beginning between 12 and 28 weeks of pregnancy.

About 1,600 women completed the double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Just under 800 were randomly put into the daily aspirin group, while just over 800 were placed in the placebo group. The women came from 13 different maternity hospitals across Europe and Israel.

Instead of relying solely on standard risk factors, the researchers combined those risk factors with measurements of maternal blood flow, blood pressure and two hormones produced by the placenta. They used an algorithm they designed to combine all those factors to select women who they believed were at a high risk of preeclampsia.

Between 11 and 14 weeks, the women began taking a daily 150 mg aspirin or a placebo. They continued taking the pills until they were 36 weeks' pregnant, or sooner if they delivered the baby early.

Just 13 women in the aspirin group developed preeclampsia, while 35 women in the placebo group developed the complication, the findings showed.

The reduction in risk was even greater for early deliveries. Women who delivered at less than 34 weeks were 82 percent less likely to have preeclampsia if they were taking 150 mg of aspirin, Nicolaides said.

There were no serious side effects for expectant mothers, or adverse events for the babies related to aspirin use during pregnancy, the researchers noted.

However, as with all drugs, women should talk to their doctor about the use of aspirin in pregnancy before taking up this regimen, because aspirin does increase the risk for bleeding.

Nicolaides said the aspirin may help improve blood flow from the mother to the placenta.

According to Kramer, ""This randomized study concludes that [aspirin's] use is not only effective for reducing the incidence of preeclampsia at term, but also preterm. This is important because it will reduce the need for preterm delivery, which is risky for the baby.""

Low-dose aspirin can also help reduce the chances of eclampsia, which is seizures due to preeclampsia for high-risk women, Kramer noted.

The study is scheduled for presentation Wednesday at the Fetal Medicine Foundation meeting in Slovenia. The findings were also published simultaneously in a special online issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.

Can an Aspirin a Day Keep a Pregnancy Complication Away?	2017-06-28 00:00:00	https://consumer.healthday.com/diseases-and-conditions-information-37/pre-eclampsia-994/can-an-aspirin-a-day-keep-a-pregnancy-complication-away-724086.html	story_reviews_00209	true
"OAK BROOK, Ill. - A minimally invasive treatment can help restore fertility in women with uterine fibroids, according to a new study published online in the journal Radiology.

Uterine fibroids, abnormal masses of fiber and muscle tissue in the wall of the uterus, are considered one of the most common causes of infertility and complications related to pregnancy. Previous research has found that one out of every four women with fibroids has problems related to fertility. The standard treatment option for such women is myomectomy, or surgical removal of the fibroids.

However, myomectomy is not always possible or effective and can result in major complications including hysterectomy, according to study co-author João Martins Pisco, M.D., Ph.D., from the Department of Interventional Radiology at Saint Louis Hospital in Lisbon, Portugal.

Uterine fibroid embolization (UFE) is a less invasive option that involves injection of an embolic agent, typically made up of very small beads, into the uterine arteries to block the blood supply to the uterus and fibroids. As the fibroids die and begin to shrink, the uterus fully recovers. UFE can be performed in patients with a prior myomectomy or in vitro fertilization (IVF).

Despite its less invasive nature, UFE has yet to be fully embraced in the medical community as a fertility-preserving treatment for women with symptomatic fibroids due to concerns that the procedure may cause inadequate blood flow to the endometrium, or lining of the uterus, and the ovaries.

For the new study, Dr. Pisco and colleagues assessed pregnancy rates in 359 women with uterine fibroids who were unable to conceive and who underwent either conventional or partial UFE. In conventional UFE, all uterine artery branches are embolized. However, the partial procedure requires treatment of only the small vessels to the fibroids, leaving the corresponding larger vessels unaffected. Partial UFE may help reduce the risks of infertility associated with conventional UFE.

After an average follow-up of almost six years, 149 of the 359 women, or 41.5 percent, had become pregnant one or more times, and 131 gave birth to a total of 150 babies. It was the first pregnancy for more than 85 percent of the women who gave birth.

The procedures had a clinical success rate of approximately 79 percent for fibroid-related symptoms. Complication rates were 14.6 percent for partial UFE and 23.1 percent for conventional UFE. The procedure was repeated in 28 patients whose fibroids had not been fully treated, as shown by MRI, and 11 of those patients subsequently got pregnant.

""Our findings show that UFE is a fertility-restoring procedure in women with uterine fibroids who wish to conceive, and pregnancy following UFE appears to be safe with low morbidity,"" Dr. Pisco said. ""Women who had been unable to conceive had normal pregnancies after UFE and similar complication rates as the general population in spite of being in a high-risk group.""

Dr. Pisco suggested that UFE may become the first-line treatment for women with fibroids who wish to conceive, particularly for those with numerous or very large fibroids. Such patients have a fibroid recurrence rate of more than 60 percent after myomectomy, making UFE an important option.

The researchers are continuing the treatments and compiling data. Since the time of writing, there were 12 additional pregnancies.

""In our study there are now almost 200 newborns following UFE,"" Dr. Pisco said. ""Our next step will be a randomized study comparing the results of partial and conventional UFE.""

"When you dine on curry and baked apples, enjoy the fact that you are eating something that could play a role starving -- or even preventing -- cancer.

New research from The University of Texas at Austin identifies several natural compounds found in food, including turmeric, apple peels and red grapes, as key ingredients that could thwart the growth of prostate cancer, the most common cancer afflicting U.S. men.

Published online this week in Precision Oncology, the new paper uses a novel analytical approach to screen numerous plant-based chemicals instead of testing a single agent as many studies do, discovering specific combinations that shrink prostate cancer tumors.

""After screening a natural compound library, we developed an unbiased look at combinations of nutrients that have a better effect on prostate cancer than existing drugs,"" says corresponding author Stefano Tiziani, assistant professor in the Department of Nutritional Sciences and Dell Pediatric Research Institute at UT Austin. ""The beauty of this study is that we were able to inhibit tumor growth in mice without toxicity.""

During the past decade, some cancer research has highlighted the potential therapies found in plants, including chemicals found in foods such as turmeric, apple peels and green tea. These compounds minimize one of the risk factors for cancer, inflammation within the body. People who have chronic inflammation because of chronic infection, autoimmune disease or conditions such as obesity have a higher cancer risk because of damage to normal cells.

The researchers first tested 142 natural compounds on mouse and human cell lines to see which inhibited prostate cancer cell growth when administered alone or in combination with another nutrient. The most promising active ingredients were then tested on model animals: ursolic acid, a waxy natural chemical found in apple peels and rosemary; curcumin, the bright yellow plant compound in turmeric; and resveratrol, a natural compound common to red grapes or berries.

""These nutrients have potential anti-cancer properties and are readily available,"" says Tiziani. ""We only need to increase concentration beyond levels found in a healthy diet for an effect on prostate cancer cells.""

The new research paper also demonstrates how the plant-based chemicals work together. Combining ursolic acid with either curcumin or resveratrol prevents cancer cells from gobbling something that they need to grow, glutamine. This is a neat solution: blocking the uptake of a nutrient needed by prostate cancer cells with nutrients that are commonly in the human diet.

"Bethesda, MD (June 5, 2017) -- There may soon be a new tool in the fight against childhood obesity. Prebiotics reduce body fat in children who are overweight or obese by altering their gut microbiota, according to new research published in Gastroenterology, the official journal of the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA). Prebiotics are non-digestible food ingredients (such as fiber) that act as fertilizers to help stimulate the growth of good bacteria already in the gut, different from probiotics, which introduce new bacteria into the system.

""This is a well-designed trial that demonstrates how a prebiotic could potentially help combat one of the most prevalent and costly conditions afflicting children in the developed world -- overnutrition -- by targeting the gut microbiome,"" said Geoffrey A. Preidis, MD, PhD, a member of the AGA Center for Gut Microbiome Research and Education scientific advisory board. ""It is promising to see this evidence that alteration of the gut microbiota can be used to restore health. As a clinician, I hope that continued research into prebiotics will lead to a new strategy for the treatment of obesity.""

Method

For this study, researchers from the University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 42 participants. Participants included children, 7 to 12 years old, who were classified as overweight or obese (>85th percentile of body mass index) but otherwise healthy. Participants were randomly assigned to groups given either the prebiotic fiber -- oligofructose-enriched inulin -- or a placebo, once daily for 16 weeks. The prebiotic was provided as a white powder, mixed in water.

""Powdered fiber, mixed in a water bottle, taken once a day is all we asked the children to change, and we got, what we consider, some pretty exciting results -- it has been fantastic,"" added Raylene A. Reimer, PhD, RD, professor and researcher in the Faculty of Kinesiology at University of Calgary, who led the study.

Results

Based on four-month intervention data, the annual projected body weight increase in the prebiotic group would be 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds), within the expected healthy range, whereas the projected increase in the placebo group was 8 kilograms (17.6 pounds), almost triple the expected yearly weight increase. Thus, supplementation with the prebiotic improved outcomes in children who were overweight or obese. Importantly, the researchers show that the prebiotic induced specific gut bacterial shifts compared to placebo.

Why is this important?

This is the first randomized controlled study to assess comprehensive changes in gut microbial composition with prebiotic intervention in children who are overweight and obese. Excess weight in childhood tends to persist into adulthood and is an early risk factor for obesity-associated morbidity and mortality, highlighting the importance of early intervention.

What's next?

The metabolic and microbial findings from this study provide a foundation for a larger clinical trial in the pediatric population. Prebiotics are inexpensive and non-invasive and therefore a plausible dietary treatment in the overweight and obese pediatric population.

"Dieters who go vegetarian not only lose weight more effectively than those on conventional low-calorie diets but also improve their metabolism by reducing muscle fat, a new study published in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition has found.

Losing muscle fat improves glucose and lipid metabolism so this finding is particularly important for people with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, says lead author, Dr. Hana Kahleová, Director of Clinical Research at the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine in Washington DC.

Seventy-four subjects with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to follow either a vegetarian diet or a conventional anti-diabetic diet. The vegetarian diet consisted of vegetables, grains, legumes, fruits and nuts, with animal products limited to a maximum of one portion of low-fat yoghurt per day; the conventional diabetic diet followed the official recommendations of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD). Both diets were restricted by 500 kilocalories per day compared to an isocaloric intake for each individual.

The vegetarian diet was found to be almost twice as effective in reducing body weight, resulting in an average loss of 6.2kg compared to 3.2kg for the conventional diet.

Using magnetic resonance imaging, Dr. Kahleová and colleagues then studied adipose (fat-storage) tissue in the subjects' thighs to see how the two different diets had affected subcutaneous, subfascial and intramuscular fat (that is, fat under the skin, on the surface of muscles and inside muscles).

They found that both diets caused a similar reduction in subcutaneous fat. However, subfascial fat was only reduced in response to the vegetarian diet, and intramuscular fat was more greatly reduced by the vegetarian diet.

This is important as increased subfascial fat in patients with type 2 diabetes has been associated with insulin resistance, so reducing it could have a beneficial effect on glucose metabolism. In addition, reducing intramuscular fat could help improve muscular strength and mobility, particularly in older people with diabetes.

Dr. Kahleová said: ""Vegetarian diets proved to be the most effective diets for weight loss. However, we also showed that a vegetarian diet is much more effective at reducing muscle fat, thus improving metabolism. This finding is important for people who are trying to lose weight, including those suffering from metabolic syndrome and/or type 2 diabetes. But it is also relevant to anyone who takes their weight management seriously and wants to stay lean and healthy.""

"AMHERST, Mass. - Results of a new study from epidemiologists at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health suggest that long-term, high intake of vegetable protein from such foods as whole grains, soy and tofu, may protect women from early menopause and could prolong reproductive function.

Consuming enriched pasta, dark bread and cold cereal were especially associated with lower risk, while they observed no similar relation to eating animal sources of protein.

""A better understanding of how dietary vegetable protein intake is associated with ovarian aging may identify ways for women to modify their risk of early onset menopause and associated health conditions,"" write first author and then-graduate student Maegan Boutot, with her advisor, professor Elizabeth Bertone-Johnson. Details appear in the current early online edition of the American Journal of Epidemiology.

Early menopause, the cessation of ovarian function before age 45, affects about 10 percent of women and is associated with higher risk of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and early cognitive decline, the authors note. Few studies have evaluated how protein intake is associated with menopause timing, they add, and to their knowledge this is the first to look specifically at early menopause.

Boutot, Bertone-Johnson and colleagues in the School of Public Health and Health Sciences at UMass Amherst, with others, evaluated the relationship between diet and risk of early menopause among members of the Nurses' Health Study II (NHS2), an ongoing prospective study of 116,000 women aged 25-42 when they entered it in 1989.

Participants were asked to report how often they ate a single serving of 131 foods, beverages and supplements over the previous year, from ""never or less than once a month"" to ""6+ per day."" They observed that women consuming approximately 6.5 percent of their daily calories as vegetable protein had a significant 16 percent lower risk of early menopause compared to women whose intake was approximately 4 percent of calories.

For a woman with a 2,000 calorie per day diet, the authors explain, this is equal to three to four servings of such foods as enriched pasta, breakfast cereal, tofu and nuts, or about 32.5 grams a day. They adjusted for age, smoking, body mass index and other possible confounding factors.

Boutot and Bertone-Johnson add, ""Though relatively few women in our study consumed very high levels of vegetable protein and our power for analyses of more extreme intake levels was limited, women consuming 9 or more percent of their calories from vegetable protein had a hazard ratio of 0.41 (95 percent confidence interval = 0.19-0.88)"" compared to those eating less than 4 percent.

Others on the study team were from Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School. The study was supported by a grant from NIH's Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

For the NHS2, follow-up questionnaires have assessed nurses' lifestyle behaviors and medical conditions every two years. Nearly 90 percent have continued to participate in followup. Diet was assessed five times over the 20-year study, allowing the researchers to capture within-person variation in changes in food and nutrient intake over times, Boutot explains. Participants in the study contributed more than 1 million person-years of follow-up, during which 2,041 women experienced early menopause.

Boutot and Bertone-Johnson suggest that more prospective studies of their findings are warranted, including studies that compare soy-based and non-soy vegetable proteins.

"Imagine plopping six cups of coffee grounds on the heads of patients just before they are wheeled into the operating room to have nose or throat surgery?

In essence, that is what a team of Vanderbilt University engineers are proposing in an effort to improve the reliability of the sophisticated ""GPS"" system that surgeons use for these delicate operations. They have designed a ""granular jamming cap"" filled with coffee grounds that does a better job of tracking patient head movements than current methods. They are disclosing the novel design and data on its effectiveness at the International Conference on Information Processing in Computer-Assisted Interventions in Barcelona on June 20.

Of course, the coffee grounds are not loose: they form a thin layer inside a stretchy silicone headpiece, which looks something like a black latex swim cap decorated with reflective dots. After the cap is placed on the patient's head, it is attached to a vacuum pump that sucks the air out of the cap, jamming the tiny grounds together to form a rigid layer that conforms closely to the shape of the patient's head. (This is the same effect that turns vacuum-packed coffee into solid bricks.)

Before surgery, a special scanner is used to map the location of the dots relative to key features on the patient's head: a process called registration. Then, during surgery an overhead camera observes the position of the dots allowing the navigation system to accurately track the position of the patient's head when the surgeon repositions it. The computer uses this information to combine a CT scan, which provides a detailed 3-D view of the bone and soft tissue hidden inside the patient's head, with the position of the instruments the surgeon is using and displays them together in real time on a monitor in the operating room.

""These are very delicate operations and a sophisticated image guidance system has been developed to help the surgeons, but they don't trust the system because sometimes it is spot on and other times it is off the mark,"" said Robert Webster, associate professor of mechanical engineering and otolaryngology, who is developing a surgical robot designed specifically for endonasal surgery. ""When we heard about this, we began wondering what was causing these errors and we decided to investigate.""

When Webster and his research team looked into the matter, they were surprised by what they found. They discovered it wasn't the hardware or the software in the guidance system that was causing the problem. It was the way the reflective markers were attached to the patient's head that was at fault. Typically, these ""fiducial markers"" are attached by an elastic headband and double-backed tape and are subject to jarring and slipping. Their tests found that skin movement and accidental bumps by operating room staff both produced large tracking errors.

""The basic assumption is that, after registration, the spatial relationships between the patient's head and the fiducial markers remains constant,"" said Patrick Wellborn, the graduate student who is making the presentation. ""Unfortunately, that is not the case. For one thing, studies have shown that the skin on a person's forehead can move as much as a half an inch relative to the skull. And accidentally bumping or dragging cables over the headband can also produce significant targeting errors.""

In fact, previous research has found that when everything goes well, the guidance system produces targeting errors of about 2 millimeters but, in about one operation out of seven, the target error is much larger, forcing the surgeon to redo the registration process.

""Actually, we do have a solution to this problem but it involves drilling and attaching the markers directly to the skull...which we don't like to do because it is painful and it's a step backwards from the majority of what we are doing,"" said Assistant Professor of Otolaryngology Paul Russell, who is collaborating with the engineers on the project.

So the team began thinking up alternative, non-invasive methods to attach these critical markers. Webster recalled some experiments that were done using coffee grounds to help robots grip irregularly shaped objects. Bladders filled with coffee grounds were built into the robot's gripper. When it grabbed an object, the bladders conformed to its shape. Then a vacuum was pulled, the coffee grounds became rigid and locked the object into place. The researchers decided to see if this technique could be applied to the problem.

In the last three years, they have gone through a number of designs. They began with headbands that had coffee-ground-filled bags over the temples. Their tests showed that these models could reduce the targeting error by about 50 percent. But the engineers still weren't satisfied.

Then, Wellborn, who was taking over the project, had a brainstorming session with fellow graduate student Richard Hendrick. Among the materials that his predecessor had left behind was a latex bald cap. ""That sparked the idea of caps in general,"" Wellborn recalled. ""We wanted something elastic that was form fitting, which led to the idea of a swim cap.""

In addition to fitting extremely tightly to the head, the new design had another advantage. The headband system has only three fiducial markers attached on the ends of three thin rods to form a triangle. The new design allowed them to attach several dozen markers directly to the surface of the cap, which the researchers believe will also contribute to improving the guidance system's accuracy.

They designed three tests to determine how well this ""granular jamming cap"" performed relative to the current headband in reducing targeting error:

They ""bumped"" both them from a number of different directions with a tennis ball filled with plastic particles swinging on the end of a string. They found that the cap reduced targeting errors by 83 percent.

They simulated the case where a cable or other piece of equipment is accidentally pushed against the two by applying forces ranging from four to six pounds in different directions. They determined that the cap outperformed the headband by 76 percent when the forces were applied to the headband and by 92 percent when they were applied to the markers.

They tested the effects of head repositioning by having an experienced surgeon reposition test subjects' heads six to seven times. In this case, the cap proved to have 66 percent lower error rates than the headband.

On the strength of these results, Vanderbilt University has applied for a patent on the design and the technology is available for licensing. (Interested parties should contact the Vanderbilt Center for Technology Transfer and Commercialization.)

""It's a very clever way--that doesn't involve drilling holes in patients' skulls--to greatly improve the accuracy of the guidance system when we are operating in the middle of a person's skull: a zone where the accuracy of the current system is inadequate,"" said Russell.

How six cups of ground coffee can improve nose, throat surgery	2017-06-29 06:00:00	https://web.archive.org/web/20170620070231/https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-06/vu-hsc061617.php	news_reviews_00211	true
"Cognitive behavioral therapy, which traditionally includes regular, and often weekly, visits to a clinician, is recommended by the American College of Physicians and other organizations for treatment of chronic insomnia.

For military personnel, internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy appears to be an effective alternative to meeting regularly with a therapist, although it is about half as effective as traditional methods, according to results of a study conducted by Daniel Taylor, University of North Texas professor of psychology and director of UNT's Sleep Health Research Laboratory.

Taylor received a $1.16 million grant from the U.S. Department of Defense for the study, which was affiliated with the STRONG STAR Consortium, a federally funded network of national experts seeking the best ways to treat behavioral health problems impacting post-9/11 service members and veterans. The study was published in SLEEP, the official journal of the Sleep Research Society.

Chronic insomnia is defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders as sleeping poorly at least three nights a week for a month or longer, despite adequate opportunity for a full night's sleep. It is ""a significant problem in the military,"" said Taylor, who noted that military personnel often develop insomnia because of rapidly changing schedules and deployments that keep them constantly on alert.

Chronic insomnia is a strong risk factor for post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and substance abuse, absenteeism and occupational accidents, Taylor said. Treatment of insomnia may not only improve sleep in these soldiers, but also improve these other conditions, he said.

""About 10 percent of deployed military personnel take sleep medications, which are effective for short-term treatment of insomnia in civilian populations. For deployed military personnel, the side effects such as grogginess, slowed cognitive processing and slowed reaction time can be dangerous,"" Taylor said.

One hundred soldiers at Fort Hood who had chronic insomnia were recruited for Taylor's study. All completed one week of sleep monitoring by keeping sleep diaries and wearing activity monitors.

One third of the participants met with clinicians at Fort Hood for cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia once a week for six weeks, while another third received the therapy via the Internet once a week for six weeks. Both the in-person and Internet therapy had the exact same content, with the Internet lessons presented as audio recordings accompanied by visual graphics and animations. A third control group of participants was contacted by the researchers every other week during the six weeks, but did not receive cognitive behavioral therapy.

Taylor discovered that the study participants who received in-person cognitive behavioral treatment for their insomnia reported significantly greater improvements in sleep quality -- as determined by the sleep diaries and activity monitors -- than those who received the Internet therapy. Both groups had greater improvements in sleep quality than those who did not receive cognitive behavioral therapy.

He noted that that cognitive behavioral therapy is ""a multifaceted intervention that can be difficult to administer without the benefit of a therapist."" Additional training in the therapy for behavioral health providers in all branches of the military is needed, he said.

In a previous study of civilians with insomnia, Taylor and his research team discovered that cognitive behavioral therapy led to significant improvements in sleep efficiency, with the research subjects' use of sleep medication declining from 87.5 percent before therapy to 54 percent afterward, although the subjects weren't required to stop taking their medication.

Kristi Pruiksma, a STRONG STAR collaborating investigator and clinical psychologist, served as a clinician on Taylor's study. She said the benefits of the online therapy include easy access to the treatment and flexibility in times for completing the sessions, which ""is really helpful for those juggling work and family demands.""

""The online program can also be done from home rather than at a military behavioral health clinic, which some service members may avoid due to concerns about stigma,"" said Pruiksma, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UT Health San Antonio).

""Successful treatment has a real impact on patients' daily lives. An important next step will be to figure out who is able to achieve good benefits from the online program and who is likely to need additional assistance from a therapist,"" she said.

"A treatment for depression using Emotional Faces Memory Task (EFMT), a technology originally developed by two Mount Sinai researchers, resulted in a significantly greater reduction of major depressive disorder (MDD) symptoms compared to a control group, according to initial clinical results presented at the Society of Biological Psychiatry Annual Scientific Convention on May 19, 2017, in San Diego. EFMT is a cognitive-emotional treatment that is delivered via an app on the Click Neurobehavioral Intervention (CNI) platform , a clinically-validated patient engagement platform developed by Click Therapeutics™.

This treatment was developed at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai by Brian Iacoviello, PhD, an Assistant Professor of Psychiatry who is Director of Scientific Affairs for Click Therapeutics, and Dennis S. Charney, MD, Anne and Joel Ehrenkranz Dean and Professor of Psychiatry, Neuroscience, and Pharmacological Sciences. The underlying mechanism for MDD that the intervention targets involves an imbalance in the activity of specific brain regions: individuals with MDD show hyperactivity of neural systems involved in emotion processing, such as the amygdala, coupled with decreased activity of systems involved in cognitive control and emotion regulation, such as the prefrontal cortex. The amygdala processes incoming emotionally salient stimuli, whereas the prefrontal cortex, as the executive center of the brain, decides whether the incoming stimuli are noteworthy.

Patients using this therapeutic are asked to identify an emotion displayed in a series of faces, and for each face, they are asked to identify the number of faces earlier in the series in which they encountered the same emotion. This aims to balance brain activity in these regions to work in concert with each other. In the trial, the therapeutic reduced MDD symptoms by 42 percent in the experimental group after six weeks compared to 15.7 percent in the control group, which was given a similar task using simple shapes instead of emotions. ""The aim is to target the thinking abnormality we see in patients with MDD - that of perseverating, ruminating, obsessing, dwelling on the negative - by activating these two nodes (emotion processing and cognitive control) simultaneously. Thus, higher cognitive control regions will stay active even while the brain is processing salient emotional stimuli, giving the individual the capacity to shift their mindfulness and attention so that they are not perseverating,"" said Dr. Iacoviello. The initial results demonstrate that the efficacy of this digital therapeutic is comparable to drug therapy, with a highly favorable safety profile. Dr. Iacoviello added, ""We will be advancing these encouraging results to the next level, by incorporating this therapeutic into a highly engaging mobile platform and launching it through the CNI platform. It's exciting to have the opportunity to test the program within a large health care system such as Mount Sinai.""

Dr. Charney said, ""Mount Sinai embraces creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship. This technology illustrates our strengths in translating health care discoveries from the academic setting into industry, and ultimately to the patients that will benefit from them.""

Mount Sinai Innovation Partners (MSIP), the commercialization-arm of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, has been a key partner in this development. Erik Lium, PhD, Senior Vice President at MSIP, said, ""We strongly believed in the potential of this technology based on early trials at Mount Sinai, and are pleased with our commercial partnership with Click Therapeutics. We look forward to the development of this technology into a digital therapeutic that will be used to treat a major disease.""

"This could be good news for those trying to prevent preterm labor: New research published online in The FASEB Journal suggests that exposing bitter taste receptors in the uterus to certain substances can stop many unwanted contractions that occur during premature labor.

""The biological mechanism of labor initiation remains unknown, and a large percentage of preterm pregnancies do not respond well to current medications,"" said Ronghua Zhuge, Ph.D., associate professor within the University of Massachusetts Medical School's Department of Microbiology and Physiological Systems in Worcester, Massachusetts. ""The bitter taste receptors that we have found on uterine muscle could be one more piece of the puzzle to understand the onset of labor, both at term and preterm, and develop new therapeutics for preterm labor.""

Zhuge and colleagues attached strips of human and mouse uterine myometrium tissue (also known as smooth muscle) to a machine that measured their contraction efforts. The researchers first exposed the tissue to native hormones such as oxytocin and chemical compounds to make it contract, mimicking normal or premature labor. They then exposed the tissue to bitter substances. By activating the bitter taste receptors in the uterus, the bitter substances relaxed the contracted uterine muscle tissue more completely than the current drugs used to prevent preterm labor in humans. The researchers also found that giving mice bitter substances before they showed any premature contractions prevented them from having early deliveries.

"Depression presents an enormous disease burden, with a reported 350 million people worldwide suffering from the disease, but traditional SSRI treatments carry a burden of their own - in dollars and side effects. New clinical research published today in PLoS One shows that over-the-counter magnesium appears safe and effective to treat mild to moderate depression.

Critical to such body functions as heart rhythm, blood pressure and bone strength, the mineral magnesium plays a role in combating inflammation in the body and has been proven to have an association with depression. However, few clinical trials have studied the supplement's effects.

Emily Tarleton, MS, RD, CD, a graduate student in Clinical and Translational Science and the bionutrition research manager in the University of Vermont's Clinical Research Center, and colleagues conducted a clinical trial of over-the-counter oral magnesium tablets for mild-to-moderate depression. Their results showed that magnesium is safe and effective and comparable to prescription SSRI treatments in effectiveness.

The researchers at the University of Vermont's Larner College of Medicine conducted an open-label, blocked, randomized cross-over trial involving 126 adults in outpatient primary care clinics. The study participants, who were currently experiencing mild-to-moderate depression, had a mean age of 52, with 38 percent of them male. Participants in the active arm of the study received 248 milligrams of elemental magnesium per day over six weeks, while those in the control arm received no treatment. Depression symptom assessments were conducted on all participants on a bi-weekly basis.

The study team found that in 112 participants with analyzable data, consumption of magnesium chloride for six weeks resulted in a clinically significant improvement in measures of depression and anxiety symptoms. In addition, these positive effects were shown quickly, at two weeks, and the supplements were well tolerated and similarly effective regardless of age, sex, or use of antidepressants, among other factors.

""This is the first randomized clinical trial looking at the effect of magnesium supplementation on symptoms of depression in U.S. adults,"" says Tarleton. ""The results are very encouraging, given the great need for additional treatment options for depression, and our finding that magnesium supplementation provides a safe, fast and inexpensive approach to controlling depressive symptoms.""

Tarleton and colleagues say the next step is to see if their promising results can be replicated in a larger, more diverse population.

"New Rochelle, NY, June 19, 2017-A pilot feasibility study to determine if young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their parents would tolerate and adhere to an office- and home-based acupuncture/acupressure intervention showed completion of all 16 biweekly sessions and measurements of their effects before, during, and after the protocol. The study design and results, which suggest further controlled studies of this intervention approach in ASD, are published in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine (JACM), a peer-reviewed publication from Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers. The article is available free on the JACM website until July 19, 2017.

Coauthors Lana Warren, EdD, OT/L and Patricia Rao, PhD, Kennedy Krieger Institute, Baltimore, MD, and David Paton, DAc, LAc, Starting Point Acupuncture and Health Services, Catonsville, MD, identified the most positive outcome of the study as the high compliance rate, with all parents of the children ages 3-10 completing the intervention. The researchers measured the effects of the intervention on factors such as the children's behavior, ability to pay attention, sleep, and aspects of parenting stress. In the article entitled ""A Pilot Observational Study of an Acupressure/Acupuncture Intervention in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder,"" most parents reported that the intervention had a positive impact on their relationship with their child.

""While a small study, the tolerance and adherence with acupressure this pilot are both hopeful signs for families of those in their care with autism spectrum disorder,"" states JACM Editor-in-Chief John Weeks, johnweeks-integrator.com, Seattle, WA.

"And that duck on a plane? It might be an emotional-support animal prescribed by a mental health professional.

The trend, which has accelerated hugely since its initial stirrings a few decades ago, is underpinned by a widespread belief that interaction with animals can reduce distress — whether it happens over brief caresses at the airport or in long-term relationships at home. Certainly, the groups offering up pets think this, as do some mental health professionals. But the popular embrace of pets as furry therapists is causing growing discomfort among some researchers in the field, who say it has raced far ahead of scientific evidence.

AD

AD

Earlier this year in the Journal of Applied Developmental Science, an introduction to a series of articles on “animal-assisted intervention” said research into its efficacy “remains in its infancy.” A recent literature review by Molly Crossman, a Yale University doctoral candidate who recently wrapped up one study involving an 8-year-old dog named Pardner, cited a “murky body of evidence” that sometimes has shown positive short-term effects, often found no effect and occasionally identified higher rates of distress.

Overall, Crossman wrote, animals seem to be helpful in a “small-to-medium” way, but it’s unclear whether the critters deserve the credit or something else is at play.

“It’s a field that has been sort of carried forward by the convictions of practitioners” who have seen patients’ mental health improve after working with or adopting animals, said James Serpell, director of the Center for the Interaction of Animals and Society at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine. “That kind of thing has almost driven the field, and the research is playing catch-up. In other words, people are recognizing that anecdote isn’t enough.”

AD

Using animals in mental health settings is nothing new. In the 17th century, a Quaker-run retreat in England encouraged mentally ill patients to interact with animals on its grounds. Sigmund Freud often included one of his dogs in psychoanalysis sessions. Yet the subject did not become a research target until the American child psychologist Boris Levinson began writing in the 1960s about the positive effect his dog Jingles had on patients.

But the evidence to date is problematic, according to Crossman’s review and others before it. Most studies had small sample sizes, she wrote, and an “alarming number” did not control for other possible reasons for a changed stress level, such as interaction with the animal’s human handler. Studies also tend to generalize across animals, she noted: If participants are measurably soothed by one golden retriever, that doesn’t mean another dog — or another species — will evoke the same response.

Even so, media headlines are often about the happiness bounce. Hal Herzog, a Western Carolina University psychologist who has long studied human-animal interactions, recalls a 2015 study on the health benefits for children of having a pet dog. “Here’s a reason to get a puppy,” NBC announced. “Kids with pets have less anxiety.”

AD

AD

That’s actually not what the study concluded. The authors did find that children with dogs had lower anxiety based on screening scores than children without dogs. Still, they cautioned that “this study does not answer whether pet dogs have direct effects on children’s mental health or whether other factors associated with acquisition of a pet dog benefit their mental health.”

It was a classic case of conflating correlation and causation, which Herzog says is common. Cherry-picked positive results also are a problem, as he says happens in promotional materials from the Human-Animal Bond Research Initiative (HABRI). The pet-industry backed organization funds research on the topic.

“The number of papers I see that start out, ‘It is now well-established that there are health benefits from owning pets’ — that drives me crazy,” Herzog said. “Yes, there’s literature that supports that. But there’s also literature that doesn’t find that.”

HABRI Executive Director Steven Feldman takes a more positive view of the science while acknowledging that more research needs to be done. “Just like getting vegetables and getting exercise, I would say having animals in our lives is also an essential element of human wellness,” he said.

To many animal lovers and pet owners, the back-and-forth might sound horribly wonky. There’s something intuitive about the good feelings animals give us. Why over-analyze it?

Alan Beck does not disagree. Beck, who directs the Center of the Human-Animal Bond at Purdue University, cites one common theory for why animals might be therapeutic. It’s called the biophilia hypothesis, and it argues that humans evolved a built-in need to affiliate with other living beings.

“Throughout history, animals gave us some comfort. So if it works for you and me in a relatively normal environment, maybe it has a special role for someone who has a depression and stress disorder — that just makes sense,” he said. “The literature does show it’s not bad. And that’s just as important.”

Focusing too much on scientific support sometimes feels like a form of “physics envy,” Beck added, “where you try to quantify everything without appreciating it.”

But there are good reasons for rigorous research on animals and mental health. In 2012, the Department of Veterans Affairs said it would not cover costs of service dogs for veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder, citing “a lack of evidence to support a finding of mental health service dog efficacy.” The department is now in the midst of a multiyear study on the topic, which could lead to government funding for these pooches.

AD

AD

Another reason, the scientists say, is for the animals’ sake. Crossman pointed to a 2014 incident at Washington University in St. Louis as an example of animal therapy gone wrong. A bear cub brought to campus during finals week nipped some students, causing a rabies scare that almost ended with the animal being euthanized. More generally, Serpell said, the popular idea that pets make you happier “is not a harmless distortion. … If the public believes that getting an animal is going to be good for them, many times an unsuitable person will get an unsuitable animal, and it doesn’t work out well for either.”

The research is getting stronger, in part because funding is growing — from HABRI as well as from a public-private partnership between the National Institutes of Health and the Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition. Crossman’s recent study at the Yale Innovative Interactions Lab was among the work being supported.

It relied not just on the Labrador retriever Pardner but seven other certified therapy dogs. Several times a month over much of the past year, they hung out at the university for 15-minute sessions with children who had just finished two stressful tasks: spontaneously crafting stories and telling them to strangers, followed by doing math problems.

AD

AD

The strangers were the researchers, and their mission was to assess whether the kids, ages 10 to 13, would find their time with the dogs to be therapeutic. The study was designed to avoid some of the pitfalls that Crossman has seen elsewhere, which is why some of the 78 young participants got to play only with a fuzzy blanket — because tactile stimulation is known to reduce stress — and why others simply waited for the 15 minutes.

“Without the controls, the changes could be due to all kinds of things, like the fact that lots of time has passed,” Crossman said. “Kids are actually pretty good at coping.”

The children completed questionnaires to assess their mood and anxiety before and after; spit samples, to measure the “stress hormone” cortisol, were taken at three points. At the end, all the kids got a “junior scientist” certificate, lots of praise and an open play session with the dogs.

AD

AD

Crossman, who emphasizes that she is an animal lover, declined to reveal the findings before they’re published. But “hopefully” they will show that dogs can affect children’s stress, she said — before quickly offering a researcher’s clarification.

“I say ‘hopefully’ not just because I think it works or hope it does, but because these programs are used so widely,” she explained. “Kids are already participating in this on a huge scale. Ideally, the order goes the other way around: We test the idea, and then we implement.”

"LONDON (Reuters) - British liquid biopsy company Angle said its Parsortix blood test had beaten current methods in identifying ovarian cancer, a breakthough that could help women receive the best possible outcome from surgery.

Headline results from a study of 400 patients in Europe and the United States showed the test to detect cancerous cells in the bloodstream correctly identified cancer in up to 95 percent of cases, the company said.

The test will enable women with ovarian cancer to be referred to gynaecological surgeons who specialize in the care of women with ovarian cancer, while patients with a benign tumor will not have to travel to specialist centers.

Angle founder and chief executive Andrew Newland said the study had demonstrated the ability to correctly detect cancer, and importantly correctly detect the absence of cancer.

The test was nearly twice as successful in eliminating false-positives than current tests, he said.

It also had the potential to identify targets on the tumor that could be used to inform treatment strategies, he said.

“The vision is that a woman who has been diagnosed with having an abnormal pelvic mass will have a simple blood test and from that we will deduce whether or not she has cancer and if she does which drug would be most suitable for her,” he said.

The performance of the test would now be validated in another study designed to meet European CE Mark and US FDA regulatory requirements, he said.

"Two personalized cancer vaccines have been found to be safe and effective at treating people with melanoma, scientists have announced.

Cancer vaccines that are personalized to the patient—designed to help the immune system identify tumors as foreign bodies and destroy them—have been considered as a potential treatment for a number of years. But working out the unique mutations of each person’s cancer, a time-consuming and complicated process, must first be identified before a vaccine can be developed for them.

In two studies published in the journal Nature, researchers have shown promising results from Phase I clinical trials. While they are very small scale—one was on six participants, the other 13—the findings mean researchers can move ahead with the vaccines, which could potentially lead to new, more effective cancer treatments.

In the first study, scientists led by Catherine Wu developed a vaccine for people who had been treated for melanoma with surgery, but who had received no other treatment. They sequenced the DNA from the tumors then created a personalized vaccine that contained neoantigens (targets for the immune response) for predicted mutations.

Six patients were given a full series of vaccinations, including five priming injections and two booster vaccinations. Four of the six had no recurrence of the disease after 25 months.

In the other study, by Ugur Sahin and colleagues, tested a personalized vaccine based on RNA (an essential link in the production of proteins encoded by DNA). They used a similar approach to Wu and her team to identify the mutations, then tested the vaccine on 13 people who were being treated for melanoma. All participants were found to have a boosted immunity against the antigens specific to their tumors. Eight were still tumor free after 23 months.

Both vaccines were deemed safe and are expected to be taken forward for further research.

These vaccines are not necessarily the future of personalized cancer treatment. Cornelius Melief, from the Leiden University Medical Center, Netherlands, said in an accompanying News & Views article that controlled, randomized Phase II clinical trials will be needed to work out if the vaccines are effective. He added, however, that the studies confirm the potential of cancer vaccines.

Elizabeth Williams, from the School of Biomedical Sciences at Queensland University of Technology, tells Newsweek the two studies “describe tantalizing complementary and consistent results in Phase 1 trials in melanoma patients using vaccines.""

""The vaccines are personalized for each individual’s tumours by harnessing technologies that enable the comprehensive analysis of the molecular fingerprint of the tumour,” she says. “The data shows that it is a safe and well tolerated strategy that stimulates relevant anti-tumor immune responses.”

However, the treatment has its downsides: “As the vaccine therapies are designed and generated specifically for each individual there is a lag time from enrollment to commencement of treatment—approximately four months—which may be too long from some patients with advanced cancer. As technologies and processes continue improve this is likely to be reduced,"" she continues.

“It is still unknown whether these vaccines will extend the survival of cancer patients, or whether they are more effective than other recently developed immunotherapies. Additional clinical trials will be required to determine the utility of these individualised neoepitope vaccines.”

Catherine Pickworth, science communication officer at Cancer Research UK said: “The promising results from these two small, early-stage studies show that personalized cancer vaccines designed to treat skin cancer are safe to use, and that for some patients, they can successfully harness the power of the body’s own immune system to kill cancer cells. The next step will be to test these personalized vaccines in larger clinical trials to see if they are better than existing treatments, if they improve survival, and what their long-term side effects could be.”"	Cancer Breakthrough: Personalized Melanoma Vaccines ‘Safe and Effective’ in First Human Clinical Trials	2017-07-05 19:03:04	https://web.archive.org/web/20170705214450/http://www.newsweek.com/cancer-vaccine-personalized-medicine-clinical-trial-632196	story_reviews_00205	true
"The road to snuffing out cigarettes once and for all can be a long one.

“I think the big thing for people to remember is that it usually takes multiple attempts to be successful at quitting smoking,” says Dr. Valerie Bonne, a pulmonologist at Froedtert & the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee who oversees the health system’s smoking cessation program. “So just because you’ve tried in the past and haven’t been successful doesn’t mean you aren’t going to be successful in the future.”

In fact, research published last year in BMJ Open, an online, open access journal, found that for many smokers it may take 30 or more quit attempts before they finally kick the habit. Along with being persistent, experts like J. Lee Westmaas, strategic director of tobacco control research at the American Cancer Society, recommend trying lots of different approaches to smoke out the leading cause of preventable death. “I would say use as many aids as you can,” he says.

For those trying to quit, one new quit aid on the horizon will be easily accessed with an internet connection and a smartphone, tablet or computer: tailored emails.

Research led by Westmaas and published in May in the journal Tobacco Control looked at the effect of sending multiple emails to smokers during a quit attempt that were customized based on information provided by those individuals, such as quit date, their top two reasons for quitting, top five triggers for smoking and intended use of cessation medications. The findings showed that approach yielded quit rates that were higher than for those who received a single, non-tailored email containing links to smoking cessation resources. Self-reported rates of abstinence from smoking at six months after enrollment in the randomized controlled trial were 36 percent in the multiple email group compared with 26.5 percent in the single email group.

What’s more – though smokers are encouraged to try different methods of quitting – the research found the emails worked as a stand-alone approach. Westmaas says some emails were tailored based on whether study respondents planned to use nicotine replacement therapy, which has been found to be helpful for those seeking to quit smoking. Those study participants who weren’t planning to use NRT received an email explaining why use of NRT is actually a good thing, he says. Those receiving multiple emails who planned on using NRT got messaging outlining all the different kinds of NRT.

“Interestingly though, when we looked at whether or not people had used NRT, our results were the same. So even when we controlled for use of NRT, we still found an effect of the intervention,” he says – that is, receiving multiple, tailored emails helped people quit smoking regardless. “The intervention was effective whether or not you use nicotine replacement therapy.”

One of the study’s limitations was that those who participated were generally well-educated. The majority were white, and only 20 percent reported a high school education or less, suggesting the possibility that results may not necessarily be generalizable to less educated or other racial or ethnic groups, the researchers wrote. They suggest that future research should examine how well tailored emails worked for these and other groups, such as cancer survivors or lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual and intersex groups.

At present, the email program studied isn’t available to the general public. But Westmaas says the American Cancer Society aims to make a similar program available soon. “We hope that by the beginning of next year we’ll have something ready,” he says, adding that it could be earlier depending on the success of efforts to secure funding for the program.

In the meantime, those who wish to get support for quit attempts but prefer to receive it in a way that fits with an on-the-go lifestyle can opt to receive text messages to support a quit attempt as well – like through smokefree.gov, a website created by the Tobacco Control Research Branch of the National Cancer Institute. NCI also offers QuitPal, a free app for iPhone or iPad, for a quit assist. The app has numerous interactive features, such as tracking smoking habits with a calendar and providing tips to deal with cravings. It also allows users to connect with social media, where they can see loved ones' personalized video messages to support their progress.

The point, however support is provided, is to deliver it in a way that best suits the individual. “It seems like people have preferences for how they want to receive information, especially about quitting,” Westmaas says.

While some gravitate toward group smoking cessation classes, for example, others prefer to talk one-on-one with a counselor or on a smoking quitline, like 1-800-QUIT-NOW (also affiliated with NCI). Others prefer less intrapersonal interaction, and technology provides a way to reach more people trying to quit. Some people in rural areas may not have access to smoking cessation programs, says Mary LeVasseur, manager of community health and wellness at Lancaster General Health, who’s responsible for the health system’s tobacco prevention and treatment programs.

The email approach is not meant to replace other options for quitting, Westmaas emphasizes, but rather to provide an additional one.

Experts point out, in particular, that medications and counseling in combination can be a powerful combination – even more effective than either alone. However, medications Chantix and Zyban are also associated with risks ranging from depressed mood, hostility and aggression to suicidal thoughts. “Most of the medication options and the nicotine-replacement options are fairly well tolerated” and effective, Bonne says. But experts say its important to keep doctors in the loop when issues arise to determine if medications or NRT should be stopped.

If using NRT to break a tobacco addiction, talk with a health provider if you experience nausea, dizziness, weakness, vomiting, fast or irregular heartbeat, “mouth problems” with the lozenge or gum or redness or swelling of the skin around an NRT patch that doesn’t go away, the Food and Drug Administration recommends. Taken by mouth, the lozenges can cause a warm or tingling sensation; and users are urged to seek medical attention right away if they experience a severe allergic reaction – which may be marked by rash, itching, swelling of the mouth or difficulty breathing – or other serious side effects.

With any attempt to quit, experts say it’s important to take stock of even small successes – like not smoking for a short period, even if it doesn’t last. “We look at tobacco dependence as a chronic disease. So that’s the most important thing – knowing that people go through many different cycles of abstinence and remission,” LeVasseur says."

"Finally, the world might be catching a break when it comes to drug-resistant gonorrhea.

A new study suggests that a vaccine that protects against a strain of meningitis may also ward off the sexually transmitted infection.

The research, conducted in New Zealand, found that the gonorrhea rate among teens and young adults there who had received a meningitis B vaccine during an emergency campaign in the early 2000s was significantly lower than the rate seen in people of the same age who weren’t vaccinated.

advertisement

Researchers in Quebec say they saw the same phenomenon after a meningitis outbreak there, and previously published data from Cuba and Norway also hint of the vaccine’s unexpected benefit.

“It’s quite probably real,” said Helen Petousis-Harris, lead author of the New Zealand article and head of immunization research and vaccinology at the University of Auckland.

The findings are observational. Clinical trials will need to be conducted to see if the effect researchers have observed is actually due to the meningococcal B vaccine. But confirmation would be good news for the prevention and control of gonorrhea.

The last remaining drugs to cure this sexually transmitted infection are showing signs they may only have a few more years of usefulness left.

“While it is still very early days, these findings represent a positive step in the search for a vaccine against this common and distressing disease that is increasingly resistant to antibiotic treatment,” said Robin Gaitens, a spokeswoman for GSK, which owns the product that contains this meningitis component.

Why would a vaccine designed to protect against a strain of bacteria that causes meningitis also prevent gonorrhea infection? Some biology is useful here.

Meningitis is a condition — inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and the spinal cord — that can be triggered by some viruses and several types of bacteria.

One of the latter is Neisseria meningitidis, sometimes known as meningococcal disease. It is the only form of bacterial meningitis that triggers epidemics.

Despite the fact that gonorrhea and meningitis are quite different from one another, the bacteria that cause Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis are actually related.

Meningococcal disease is rare but very dangerous. It can kill, and quickly. People who survive the infection can suffer permanent brain damage or may lose one or several limbs.

Because of the severity of the consequences, health officials often mount emergency vaccination campaigns in response to outbreaks of Neisseria meningitidis.

There are vaccines for several Neisseria meningitidis strains, but designing a vaccine to protect against the B strain was a particularly difficult nut to crack. As a consequence, the vaccine component that was made to protect against B targets a different part of the bacterium, Petousis-Harris said.

That may explain why the B vaccine appears to offer some protection against Neisseria gonorrhea. Meningococcal vaccines that protect against the other strains do not seem to have the same effect.

“A lot of these vaccines have been used widely globally,” Petousis-Harris said. “And what’s happened with gonorrhea? Nothing. Gonorrhea carries on its merry little way.”

New Zealand had a very bad meningococcal outbreak in the early 2000s caused by the B strain. A special vaccine that only protected against that strain was made; it was used between 2004 and 2008.

Petousis-Harris and her colleagues looked later to see if gonorrhea rates had changed after that meningococcal vaccination campaign. They found people who were vaccinated were 31 percent less likely to be infected with gonorrhea than those who hadn’t received the meningococcal B vaccine.

The study, published Monday in the Lancet, was funded by GSK and Auckland Uniservices, the commercialization arm of the University of Auckland.

The single-component vaccine used by New Zealand is no longer made. But the same component is one of several in the Bexsero vaccine, which was used in Quebec when the government decided to vaccinate against meningococcal B disease in a part of the province with a high relative rate of cases a few years ago.

Dr. Jean Longtin, head of the province’s public health laboratory, said he and some colleagues decided to look at whether the vaccination campaign was having an impact on gonorrhea rates in that area after reading about an early observation from Norway.

“In Quebec we saw the exact same effect as New Zealand,” said Longtin, who said his group is still analyzing its findings. “Gonorrhea rates have been going down in the vaccine group whereas in the non-vaccine group it’s following the rest of the province.”

It is not clear how long the protection — if it’s real — will actually last. But even a few years of protection could help significantly reduce the spread of gonorrhea, experts argue.

“Mathematical modeling has shown that even a vaccine of moderate efficacy and duration could have a substantial effect on the transmission and prevalence of gonorrhea, if coverage in the population is high and protection lasts during the highest risk period,” Kate Seib, of Australia’s Institute for Glycomics, wrote in a commentary that accompanied the study."

"If you’re the type of person who needs at least one cup of coffee to get out of the house in the morning and a few more to make it through the day, you might think the best thing about java is that it keeps you awake.

But new research suggests that’s just a bonus. The best thing about your coffee habit might be that it extends your life by reducing your risk of death from heart disease, diabetes or even cancer.

Two large studies published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that the more coffee a person drank, the lower his or her risk of early death. The results were largely consistent among more than 700,000 study participants from a variety of racial, ethnic and cultural backgrounds.

And get this: The inverse relationship between coffee consumption and death held up even for people who drank decaf.

Previous research had already offered strong hints that coffee isn’t bad for you, and might actually be good for you. But those studies generally involved fewer people, most of whom were of European descent.

A team from the National Cancer Institute, USC and the University of Hawaii sought to correct that by examining coffee-drinking habits in 185,855 Americans who were participating in the Multiethnic Cohort Study, which has been tracking volunteers since 1993. On average, each volunteer was followed for 16.2 years.

Compared with the 16% of people who didn’t drink coffee at all, those who downed two or more cups each day were about 18% less likely to have died during the study period. In addition, those who drank just one to six cups of coffee per week were 12% less likely to die. Both of these figures were calculated after taking into account known risk factors for early death, such as smoking (which is often paired with coffee drinking), diet and body mass index.

When the researchers examined whites, blacks, Latinos, Japanese Americans and Native Hawaiians separately, they “found no indication that the associations varied by race/ethnicity,” according to their report. The link between coffee and longevity was statistically significant in all groups except for the Native Hawaiians. The researchers said this was probably because there weren’t enough of them in the study to rule out the possibility that the link was just a fluke.

The study authors also compared coffee drinking with each of the 10 leading causes of death in the U.S. (which combined to account for 81% of the 58,397 deaths that occurred during the study period). The more coffee one drank, the less likely he or she was to die of heart disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory disease, stroke, diabetes or kidney disease. Coffee apparently had no effect on the risk of dying of influenza or pneumonia, Alzheimer’s disease, accidents or suicide.

Until now, there hasn’t been much data to go on regarding coffee and health risks in people who aren’t white. Without it, researchers couldn’t say whether the inverse association observed in people of European descent would apply to people of other backgrounds as well.

Now they can see that it does. Not only is this useful information to coffee drinkers, it also suggests that there’s a biological explanation for the link. (More on that later.)

A second study mined data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study to see whether there was a link between coffee and early death among 521,330 people from 10 countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom). These volunteers were tracked for an average of 16.4 years.

Once again, the researchers (most of whom were from Europe) found that the top 25% of coffee drinkers in each nation were less likely to die during the study period than their countrymen who shunned coffee altogether. After accounting for smoking, diet and other factors, the authors calculated that the risk of early death was 12% lower in men and 7% lower in women.

As with the American study, the European team “found no evidence” that coffee was linked to better health only for people in certain countries.

Both studies found similar results for people who drank decaffeinated coffee as for people who drank the real thing.

Though the two studies involved hundreds of thousands of people, they weren’t designed to show that drinking more coffee caused people to live longer; that would require a randomized trial.

However, there are reasons to think that compounds in coffee would reduce the risk of premature death, according to an editorial that accompanies the studies.

For instance, the polyphenols found in coffee act as antioxidants, helping cells cope with the damaging effects of molecules called free radicals. In addition, genes related to caffeine metabolism also influence things like blood pressure and cholesterol.

Both groups of researchers also noted that previous studies have linked coffee drinking to improvements in the body’s liver function, sensitivity to insulin and inflammation.

The editorial concluded that it was still “premature” to recommend coffee as a way to “reduce mortality or prevent chronic disease.” But the results should alleviate any fears that there’s something dangerous about drinking up to five cups of coffee each day, the authors added.

Considering that an estimated 2.25 billion cups of coffee are consumed somewhere in the world each day, that’s something to celebrate with an espresso, a latte, a cappuccino or a regular cuppa joe.

"Emily Whitehead, 12, catches fireflies in her backyard in Philipsburg, Pa. In 2012, Emily was the first child treated with an experimental immunotherapy that is on the verge of approval by the Food and Drug Administration. (Sean Simmers for The Washington Post)

When doctors saw the report on Bill Ludwig’s bone-marrow biopsy, they thought it was a mistake and ordered the test repeated. But the results came back the same: His lethal leukemia had been wiped out by an experimental treatment never before used in humans.

“We were hoping for a little improvement,” remembered the 72-year-old retired New Jersey corrections officer, who had battled the disease for a decade. He and his oncologist both broke down when she delivered the good news in 2010. “Nobody was hoping for zero cancer.”

The pioneering therapy administered to Ludwig and a few other adults at the University of Pennsylvania hospital paved the way for clinical trials with children. Six-year-old Emily Whitehead, who was near death, became the first pediatric recipient in 2012. Like Ludwig, she remains cancer-free.

Such results are why the treatment is on track to become the first gene therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration. An FDA advisory committee will decide Wednesday whether to recommend approval of the approach, which uses patients’ own genetically altered immune cells to fight blood cancers.

If the panel gives the nod, the agency probably will follow suit by the end of September. That would open the latest chapter in immunotherapy — “a true living drug,” said Penn scientist Carl June, who led its development.

Emily and her father, Tom Whitehead, have some ice cream alongside their dog, Lucy. Emily remains cancer-free five years after receiving CAR T-cell therapy. (Sean Simmers for The Washington Post)

The CAR T-cell treatment, manufactured by the drug company Novartis, initially would be available only for the small number of children and young adults whose leukemia does not respond to standard care. Those patients typically have a grim prognosis, but in the pivotal trial testing the therapy in almost a dozen countries, 83 percent of patients went into remission. A year later, two-thirds remained so.

And childhood leukemia is just the start for a field that has attracted intense interest in academia and industry. Kite Pharma of Santa Monica, Calif., has applied for FDA approval to treat aggressive non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and a similar Novartis application is close behind. Researchers also are exploring CAR T-cell therapy’s use for multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the disease that afflicted Ludwig. They are also tackling a far more difficult challenge — using the therapy for solid tumors in the lungs or brain, for example.

The excitement among doctors and researchers is palpable. “We’re saving patients who three or four years ago we were at our wit’s end trying to keep alive,” said Stephen Schuster, the Penn oncologist who is leading a Novartis lymphoma study. That study and a Kite trial have shown that the treatment can put about one-third of adults with advanced disease — those who have exhausted all options — into remission.

Yet along with the enthusiasm come pressing questions about safety, cost and the complexity of the procedure.

It involves extracting white blood cells called T cells — the foot soldiers of the immune system — from a patient’s blood, freezing them and sending them to Novartis’s sprawling manufacturing plant in Morris Plains, N.J. There, a crippled HIV fragment is used to genetically modify the T cells so they can find and attack the cancer. The cells then are refrozen and sent back to be infused into the patient.

Once inside the person’s body, the T-cell army multiplies astronomically.

Novartis has not disclosed the price for its therapy, but analysts are predicting $300,000 to $600,000 for a one-time infusion. Brad Loncar, whose investment fund focuses on companies that develop immunotherapy treatments, hopes the cost does not prompt a backlash. “CAR-T is not the EpiPen,” he said. “This is truly pushing the envelope and at the cutting edge of science.”

The biggest concerns, however, center on safety. The revved-up immune system becomes a potent cancer-fighting agent but also a dangerous threat to the patient. Serious side effects abound, raising concerns about broad use.

“Treating patients safely is the heart of the rollout,” said Stephan Grupp of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, who as director of the hospital’s cancer immunotherapy program led early pediatric studies as well as Novartis’s global trial. “The efficacy takes care of itself, but safety takes a lot of attention.”

One of the most common side effects is called cytokine release syndrome, which causes high fever and flulike symptoms that in some cases can be so dangerous that the patient ends up in intensive care. The other major worry is neurotoxicity, which can result in temporary confusion or potentially fatal brain swelling. Juno Therapeutics, a biotech firm in Seattle, shut down one of its CAR T-cell programs after five patients died of brain swelling. Novartis has not seen brain swelling in its trials, company officials said.

To try to ensure patient safety, Novartis is not planning a typical product rollout, with a drug pushed as widely and aggressively as possible. The company instead will designate 30 to 35 medical centers to administer the treatment. Many of them took part in the clinical trial, and all have gotten extensive training by Grupp and others.

Grupp said he and his staff learned about the side effects of CAR T-cell therapy — and what to do about them — through terrifying experiences that began five years ago with Emily Whitehead.

The young girl, who had relapsed twice on conventional treatments for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, was in grave condition. Grupp suggested to her parents that she be the first child to get the experimental therapy.

“I said, ‘Surely, this has been tried on kids somewhere else in the world,’ ” recalled her father, Thomas Whitehead of Philipsburg, Pa. “But Steve said, ‘Nope, some adults got it, but that was a different kind of leukemia.’ ”

After she received the therapy, Emily’s fever soared, her blood pressure plummeted, and she ended up in a coma and on a ventilator for two weeks in the hospital’s intensive care unit. Convinced his patient would not survive another day, a frantic Grupp got rushed lab results that suggested a surge of the protein Interleukin 6 was causing her immune system to relentlessly hammer her body. Doctors decided to give Emily an immunosuppressant drug called tocilizumab.

She was dramatically better within hours. She woke up the next day, her seventh birthday. Tests showed her cancer was gone.

The approval of CAR T-cell therapy would represent the second big immunotherapy advance in less than a decade. In 2011, the FDA cleared the first agent in a new class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors. It has approved five more since then.

There are big differences between the two approaches. The checkpoint inhibitors are targeted at solid tumors, such as advanced melanoma and lung and bladder cancer, while CAR T-cell therapy has been aimed at blood disorders. And although checkpoint inhibitors are off the shelf, with every patient getting the same drug, CAR T-cell therapy is customized to an individual. Many immunotherapy experts think the greatest progress against cancer will be achieved when researchers figure out how to combine the approaches.

For the Penn team, the CAR T-cell story goes back decades, starting at the then-National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., where June and a postdoctorate fellow named Bruce Levine worked on new HIV treatments. In the process, they figured out a way to turbocharge T cells to make them more powerful and plentiful.

The pair moved to Philadelphia in 1999 and dove into cancer research. Two years later, June’s wife died of ovarian cancer, something he has credited as spurring him to work even harder in the field. In the years that followed, researchers across the country, including at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, racked up an array of tantalizing discoveries involving T cells.

Fast-forward to 2010, when Ludwig, who lives in Bridgeton, N.J., became Penn’s first patient to receive CAR T-cell therapy. Two other men got the treatment not long after. One is still in remission; the other relapsed and died.

But after those three patients, the Penn researchers ran out of money for more treatments. To try to raise interest and funding, they decided to publish the results of their work. The article that appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine in August 2011 created a “firestorm,” June said — one that brought them new resources. David Porter, a Penn oncologist working with June, was on vacation in western Maryland and had to stop at a Kohl’s to buy a dress shirt for the immediate TV interviews.

The pediatric trial opened the following spring with Emily. Six months later, Penn licensed its technology to Novartis in exchange for financial support, which included a new on-campus cell-manufacturing facility.

With FDA approval seeming imminent, the researchers who were so instrumental in the therapy’s development and testing are almost giddy. Grupp is especially pleased that the advance will be available first to children. “Usually everything is developed first for adults,” he noted recently, “and children are an afterthought.”

THURSDAY, July 20, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- A laser treatment can reduce spots in people's vision known as ""floaters,"" a new study finds.

""Floaters often arise as the vitreous -- a gel-like substance that fills the eye -- contracts and pulls away from the back of the eye,"" explained ophthalmologist Dr. Naomi Goldberg, who reviewed the new research. She works at the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital in New York City.

Floaters become more common with age, and although some people simply get used to them, others are bothered by them or their vision is impaired.

The new research was led by Dr. Chirag Shah and Dr. Jeffrey Heier of Ophthalmic Consultants of Boston. They explained that, currently, there are three management options for floaters: patient education and observation; surgery; and a laser procedure known as YAG vitreolysis.

However, Shah and Heier said there are few published studies on the laser treatment's effectiveness in treating floaters.

The new study involved 52 patients with floaters who received one session of either the YAG laser treatment or a ""sham"" placebo laser treatment.

Six months after treatment, 54 percent of patients in the YAG group reported significantly greater improvement in floater-related visual disturbances, compared with only 9 percent of those in the placebo group.

Nineteen patients (53 percent) in the YAG group reported significantly or completely improved symptoms, compared with none of the patients in the placebo group, the researchers added.

The patients in the YAG group also had improvements in several other measures, including general vision and independence, compared with those in the placebo group, the findings showed.

There were no differences between the two groups in harmful side effects, according to the study, which was published July 20 in JAMA Ophthalmology.

A limitation of the study was its small size and short follow-up period, the researchers said. ""Greater confidence in these outcomes may result from larger confirmatory studies of longer duration,"" the study authors wrote.

For her part, Goldberg said that although ""there was significant improvement in patients' symptoms following treatment, and no significant complication was seen,"" these findings are early and ""it is difficult to predict the long-term safety of this laser procedure.""

"The policy response to the opioid epidemic is frequently framed as a conflict: If you pull back the opioid painkillers that led to the epidemic, you are going to harm the pain patients who use these opioids to treat their pain. In effect, you’re trading one problem (addiction) for another (undertreatment of chronic pain).

A new study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, however, offers a cause for optimism: Reviewing the research so far, it found that it may be possible to reduce doses for patients in long-term opioid therapy and improve their pain outcomes. So doctors can potentially pull back the opioids that launched the current drug overdose crisis and still successfully treat pain patients.

Now, by this latest study’s own admission, the evidence is of generally poor quality. Most of the studies reviewed were of poor methodology or sample size, while only a few were of “fair” or “good” quality. The review also only looked at patients who volunteered to taper off opioids, meaning this research does not prove that involuntarily pulling patients off the drugs will lead to similar outcomes.

Suffice to say, then, a lot more research is necessary before this issue is settled.

But the new study does offer a glimmer of hope in a fairly grim opioid epidemic: Maybe it is possible to reduce the amount of dangerous opioids that patients are consuming and still alleviate people’s pain.

What the study found

For the latest review of the evidence, researchers looked at 67 studies that collectively provided data on more than 12,000 pain patients who were weaned off at least some opioids. Though the researchers found a lot of studies to pool from, they generally graded these studies as “very low” in quality and methodology.

Researchers then identified the studies — none of which were graded as “good” quality — that evaluated pain-related outcomes for patients after long-term opioid therapy was tapered. Focusing on the “fair-quality” studies, they found that after opioid dose reductions, patients on average saw improved pain, function, and quality of life.

The authors provide a few possible explanations for this: Perhaps the non-opioid pain treatments, such as physical therapy and meditation, that accompanied dose reductions simply produced better results than the opioids did. Maybe the opioids themselves caused problems that negatively impacted function or quality of life, “such as constipation, fatigue, poor sleep, and depressed mood.” It’s possible that opioid dose reduction also resolved what’s known as opioid-induced hyperalgesia, “a paradoxical response in which patients receiving opioids become more sensitive to painful stimuli.”

Or, the researchers suggested, the observational studies simply showed reverse causation — “that is, patients successfully tapered opioids because pain severity decreased.”

The findings do not mean that doctors can now simply yank patients off opioids and expect them to get better. For one, the reviewed studies generally looked at the results of tapering, when patients are slowly weaned off opioid painkillers — a process that, Stanford psychiatrist Anna Lembke told me, can take months or even years.

Crucially, the studies also looked at what happened when these reductions in opioid doses were paired with alternative treatments, including alternative medicines like acupuncture, interdisciplinary pain programs, and medication-assisted treatment for addiction. This is very, very different from a situation in which a patient is taken off opioids and effectively left stranded without any other form of care.

As the researchers readily admit, the study also had several major limitations. Most of the studies analyzed were of poor quality — meaning there’s a serious need for better research in this area. And the studies only evaluated voluntary reductions in opioid doses; it’s entirely possible that involuntary reductions in opioid doses would lead to sharply different outcomes.

“We should be cautious in interpreting the findings,” Joseph Frank, lead author of the study, told me. He emphasized that more research needs to be done to fill “important gaps” in our knowledge. He added, “I want patients and their doctors to use caution in applying this.”

A few pain patients will still benefit from opioids

One of the study’s implications is that opioids actually aren’t a good treatment for chronic pain. This isn’t new. As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded in its 2016 summary of the research, there are simply no good long-term studies looking at the effects of opioids on long-term pain outcomes, while there are many studies showing that long-term opioid use can lead to bad results in other areas, including addiction and overdose.

That does not mean opioids are never an effective treatment for chronic pain.

As addiction and pain experts often tell me, health care can vary vastly from patient to patient. Some patients feel worse on opioids, while others report quick pain relief. Some patients experience grueling withdrawal if taken off opioids, while for others the symptoms are much less severe. Some patients are at unusually high risk for addiction, while many — most, in fact — aren’t. And so on.

In a few cases, then, opioids will still be the best answer for some individual chronic pain patients. When prescribed carefully on a schedule that works to diminish the excessive buildup of tolerance, they can work for some people. But as Stanford pain specialist Sean Mackey emphasized to me, opioids should not be a first-line treatment due to the risks, and alternatives should be tried first.

This, then, is another key caveat to the study: Its findings shouldn’t be applied to every patient. Like much of health care, each case will typically require individual evaluations to see what works.

“There are people who do well with tapering [opioids],” Stefan Kertesz, an addiction researcher at the University of Alabama Birmingham who was not involved in the study, told me. “There are people who do not do well with tapering.”

But the study suggests that getting some patients off opioids could improve their pain outcomes. The key is convincing patients that this truly can work so they buy into the treatment and genuinely follow through with it — and making non-opioid treatments for pain accessible enough that patients see them as realistic options.

Alternative pain treatments need to be made more accessible

The reality, though, is non-opioid pain treatments are often out of reach for many Americans. Patients may not have insurance to cover the treatment. Even if they do have insurance, their health plan might not cover comprehensive pain care. And even if they do have insurance and their health plan covers pain treatments, there may not — particularly in rural areas — be a nearby pain clinic or doctor who can actually provide the care these patients are seeking.

This is something the study’s authors readily acknowledge.

“It’s an important part of this challenge,” Frank said. “These non-opioid strategies that were tested in these research studies are not adequately available. Several of the studies were done in pain centers where they have expert programs, and those just are not widespread.”

In fact, the lack of access to non-opioid strategies may be one big reason that doctors resorted to opioids in the first place. The drugs offered an easy answer — if ultimately an ineffective one — to the many problems doctors faced, including patients who had complicated pain problems that physicians didn’t fully understand and tight schedules driven by the current demands of the health care system that made it hard to take the time to work through a patient’s individual problems. (More on all that in my interview with Lembke.)

To address this, Frank argued that patients need better access to pain treatments. And doctors, especially primary care doctors who are frequently the first people patients see in the health care system, also need to be better trained to deal with chronic pain.

These solutions could help a lot of people: According to one study from the Institute of Medicine, 100 million US adults suffer from chronic pain. The opioid epidemic shows that if this care isn’t made available, patients may end up resorting to drugs that can literally get them killed — or, as has been reported in other tragic cases, they may kill themselves once the pain grows too bad. (The newest study, however, noted that there is no good research yet looking at these two potential outcomes if pain patients are taken off opioids.)

“Not only do we lack the data, but I have seen and heard of countless cases of overdose and suicide from people who have been involuntarily discontinued,” Kertesz said, emphasizing this is strictly based on anecdotal observations. “One day in June, in my inbox were 42 deaths.”

Opioid policy is a balancing act

The findings show the balancing act of opioid policy: Even if doctors need to pull back opioids, they must be careful to ensure patients suffering from debilitating pain and other problems can still meet their other care needs.

It’s not just pain care. When dealing with opioid users who are addicted, doctors and policymakers also need to ensure that addiction treatment is available. Otherwise, these patients will likely try to find another source of drugs — even if it means resorting to a riskier opioid, such as heroin or fentanyl, to satisfy their cravings.

There’s good evidence this happened to many — but not all — opioid painkiller users: A 2014 study in JAMA Psychiatry found 75 percent of heroin users in treatment started with painkillers, and a 2015 analysis by the CDC found people who are addicted to painkillers are 40 times more likely to be addicted to heroin.

The fundamental problem is many of these patients don’t get addiction treatment once they lose access to painkillers or before they progress to heroin or fentanyl. Without the option of treatment, opioid users’ only answer to averting dependence-induced withdrawal becomes harder drugs. Yet based on a 2016 report by the surgeon general, only 10 percent of Americans with drug use disorders get specialty treatment.

That doesn’t mean that reducing prescriptions is a mistake. By stopping doctors from unscrupulously prescribing the drugs, governments can potentially stop opioids from flowing to new users who didn’t really need the drugs and could have developed addictions had they been allowed to get painkillers.

But the reduction has to be paired with increased access to addiction care — and it frequently hasn’t been.

Beyond addiction treatment, Kertesz argued that policymakers should also address some of the underlying conditions that drive addiction. He emphasized the need for broader mental health care, given that people often have mental health issues that can make addiction more likely.

“Who is at higher risk — John with PTSD and a dose of 10 milligrams a day, or James, who has no PTSD and is on 200 milligrams a day?” Kertesz said. Based on his reading of the data, “it’s John with PTSD on the 10 milligrams.”

But as is true for addiction and pain treatments, adequate mental health care is also out of reach for many patients — showing just another way that the US health care system isn’t built to adequately address the full needs of patients.

All of this shows why the policy solution to the opioid epidemic isn’t as easy as simply pulling back prescription opioids: To avoid exacerbating existing problems or causing new ones, policymakers need to consider the other needs of people who were perhaps getting opioids they didn’t really need."

Patients reported improvement in symptoms of eye floaters after treatment with a laser, according to a study published by JAMA Ophthalmology.

Floaters become more prevalent with age and although most patients grow accustomed to them, many find them bothersome, and they can worsen visual quality. Three management options exist for floaters: patient education and observation; surgery; and the laser procedure, YAG vitreolysis, of which there are limited published studies on its effectiveness for treating floaters.

Chirag P. Shah, M.D., M.P.H., and Jeffrey S. Heier, M.D., of the Ophthalmic Consultants of Boston, randomly assigned 52 patients (52 eyes) to receive YAG laser vitreolysis (n = 36) in one session or a sham (placebo) laser treatment (control; n = 16).

Six months after treatment, the YAG group reported significantly greater improvement in self-reported floater-related visual disturbance (54 percent) compared with sham controls (9 percent). A total of 19 patients (53 percent) in the YAG laser group reported significantly or completely improved symptoms vs 0 individuals in the sham group. Several measures of quality of life also improved compared with those in the sham laser group, including general vision and independence. No differences in adverse events between groups were identified.

A limitation of the study was its small sample size and short follow-up period.

“Greater confidence in these outcomes may result from larger confirmatory studies of longer duration,” the authors write.

"Beyond The Nasty Needle: Trying To Make Vaccines More Comfy And Convenient

News this summer of a flu vaccine patch sparked a lot of chatter. Could getting vaccinated be as easy as putting on a bandage? Could there be fewer, or at least smaller, needles in our future?

Some companies and academic labs are working to make those things happen.

They're refining technologies that involve tiny needles, less than a millimeter long, and needle-free injectors that can send a dose of vaccine through your skin in a fraction of a second.

Some of these technologies are already available on the market, while others are still being tested.

One hundred very tiny needles

A flu vaccine patch is not yet available to the public. But one version developed by Georgia Tech's Laboratory for Drug Delivery showed promising results in its first human clinical trial, according to a study published in The Lancet in June.

The patch, about the size of a small square bandage, has tiny, dissolvable needles filled with a dose of flu vaccine. It's placed on the arm and activated through pressure. The microneedles dissolve into the skin, releasing the vaccine.

In the study, 100 participants received either the flu vaccine patch, a standard flu shot or a placebo via a patch.

Six months later, no one involved in the study had gotten the flu. People in the microneedle patch groups reported some redness, itching and tenderness but no serious side effects.

People who received the flu patch had comparable immune responses to people who had gotten the flu shot.

About 70 percent of the patients in the study preferred the patch to the regular shot, says Yasmine Gomaa, the lab's associate director.

Now, Gomaa's lab is looking beyond the flu vaccine. She says the microneedle patch could be particularly helpful in developing countries because it uses a form of vaccines that doesn't need to be kept as cold as regular vaccines. It can be stored at temperatures as high as 104 degrees Fahrenheit for up to a year, she says.

And the patch can be administered by people who aren't trained health professionals. A number of the people in the flu patch study applied it to themselves.

In 2015, Georgia Tech and the pharmaceutical company Micron Biomedical won $2.5 million in grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to develop a patch for polio immunization.

Gomaa's hope is that vaccine patches will cost less than vaccinations do now.

A 2016 study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the use of vaccine patches could save on cooling costs and could cut down on waste. Its analysis concluded that a dose of measles vaccine with the patch would cost just under $1, while a typical shot would cost $1.65. But that didn't take into account the costs of getting the patch to market.

The potential cost savings wouldn't happen until the patches were in ""routine use,"" the CDC noted.

A twist on Star Trek technology

Others in the vaccine-delivery business are taking a different approach, using a new twist on a needle-free device called a jet injector that has been around for more than half a century.

Star Trek featured such a device, calling it a ""hypospray.""

Portal Instruments, a company that is developing jet injectors, uses technology based on work done by Ian Hunter at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

""Initially, we worked on microneedles,"" says the company's CEO Patrick Anquetil. ""And then Ian realized that why don't we just remove the needle altogether? And that's how this project came to be.""

Needle-free jet injectors were actually used in the 1960s in mass smallpox vaccination campaigns. As described by the CDC, these devices use a high-pressure, narrow stream of fluid to penetrate the skin. The diameter of the stream is comparable to a mosquito bite.

The devices were used to quickly vaccinate large numbers of people, including members of the armed forces.

Anquetil notes that the older devices sometimes made patients feel as if they had been punched.

""To create the jet, you have to instantaneously create 100 times more pressure than you've got in the tire of a car,"" he says. ""Patients actually hated them because they were more painful than a needle and syringe.""

Others echo that sentiment.

""My 85-year-old neighbor still remembers how painful it was,"" says Ron Lowy, CEO of PharmaJet, a company that makes an FDA-approved jet injector that administers a flu vaccine.

The older devices had another problem. They used the same nozzle for multiple injections, leading to concerns about the transmission of bloodborne pathogens between patients.

Today's devices have made a lot of progress, Lowy says. Now, the syringe is changed for each patient and the injections are gentler.

""It feels like somebody snapped me with a rubber band,"" he says, adding that the injection happens too fast for some patients to register any sensation at all. It lasts about one-tenth of a second.

He says hundreds of thousands of people in the U.S. have already received the flu vaccine via one of PharmaJet's injectors.

""If you have your choice, you want to get poked with a needle or you want to try this? Most of the people say, 'Yeah, I'll try that,' "" he says.

Cost remains an issue for some jet injectors. Portal is aiming to get its cost down to $3 or $4 per injection.

""In vaccines, what's really hard is that there's a very, very high volume, and you're competing with a needle and syringe, which is tremendously low cost,"" Anquetil says.

PharmaJet says the ability to give precise doses helps to save money. The company says its flu vaccine ""starter kit,"" which can vaccinate 500 people, costs $900.

Nasal spray hits a roadblock

FluMist, an FDA-approved flu vaccine delivered through a nasal spray, was widely used in the U.S. and, at one point, was even the preferred method of vaccination for children.

Then last year, in a sharp turnaround, the CDC recommended that it not be used during the 2016-17 flu season after a study found it had not been very effective in the previous year, particularly among kids.

The vaccine's effectiveness was just 3 percent, so low that ""no protective benefit could be measured"" for children ages 2 to 17, the CDC said in a statement.

In contrast, the effectiveness of the flu shot was about 63 percent for kids in that age group.

AstraZeneca, the parent company behind FluMist, says the CDC's data contradicts data from several other studies, which show the vaccine was about 48 percent effective during the same flu season. And the same vaccine continues to be recommended and used in European Union markets, AstraZeneca says.

In the U.S., the CDC continues to recommend against the nasal spray vaccine for the upcoming flu season. AstraZeneca hopes to reverse that decision before flu season begins.

""We continue to pursue a broad-based investigation to identify potential causes of lower effectiveness"" in recent years, the company said in a statement, adding that one of the four flu virus strains it used in the vaccine during the past two flu seasons may have been the problem.

The company has chosen a new strain of live virus that is similar to other strains that have proven effective in studies and clinical trials."	Beyond The Nasty Needle: Trying To Make Vaccines More Comfy And Convenient	2017-07-23 06:00:00	http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/07/23/537287781/beyond-the-nasty-needle-trying-to-make-vaccines-more-comfy-and-convenient	story_reviews_00197	true
"Developing a vaccine to stop HIV is thought to be among the most daunting challenges in medicine for one big reason: The virus is extraordinarily genetically diverse, even more so than the flu. So it’s difficult to think about how a single shot might work against all the different HIV subtypes circulating around the world.

But scientists may be inching toward a vaccine that could tackle HIV’s genetic diversity and prevent the virus from taking hold in people.

Researchers from the National Institutes of Health and Johnson & Johnson at the International AIDS Society conference in Paris Monday morning presented data on a clinical trial of what’s called the “Ad26-env mosaic vaccine.”

The mosaic vaccine was developed using a computer algorithm to analyze HIV data from around the world and select a range of HIV sequences to include in a shot. It’s called a “mosaic” because it involves taking pieces of different viruses and sticking them together to generate immune responses that can cover a broad range of HIV subtypes.

“One of the great challenges for development of HIV vaccine is viral diversity,” said Dan Barouch, a lead researcher on the vaccine and director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. “The mosaic strategy is one way to attempt to deal with the global virus diversity.”

A word of caution, though: We’re only in the early phase of human testing, and the vaccine could ultimately fail to prevent the virus from spreading among people. But so far, the HIV community is carefully watching the Ad26 vaccine research because the approach seems quite promising.

The mosaic approach seems promising in very early clinical research

In the 35 years of the HIV epidemic, only four HIV vaccine concepts have been tested in humans. The mosaic strategy is the fifth concept, and one of only two HIV vaccines that’s currently part of clinical trials of efficacy in humans. (The other is the HVTN 702 HIV vaccine candidate, now underway in Thailand.)

In the study of the Ad26 mosaic vaccine, called the APPROACH trial, 393 volunteers in the United States, Rwanda, Uganda, South Africa, and Thailand were randomly assigned to receive one of seven experimental vaccines or a placebo. The mosaic vaccine was the best tolerated and also capable of generating anti-HIV immune responses in all the people who received the shots.

Before this, studies of the mosaic vaccine in rhesus monkeys showed a 66 percent efficacy rate, meaning 66 percent of monkeys that got the shot were protected from the virus. (With HIV, 50 to 60 percent is about the efficacy range researchers hope for.) Interestingly, in the early human study, the immune response was comparable to the rhesus monkey one, which gave the researchers hope that the vaccine might be similarly effective in people.

We need more human studies of this HIV vaccine

But we still don’t know if the vaccine will protect humans from the virus, since the studies so far have only looked at safety and immune responses, not efficacy. And many medicines that look promising in animals, and safe in humans, don’t pan out in clinical trials focused on efficacy.

“I wouldn’t use the word excited too much,” said Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “It’s a step forward toward getting another candidate into trial that could have some promise.” It’s too soon to say if and when the mosaic vaccine might work to prevent the virus from spreading in humans, he added.

As for next steps, if the researchers continue to see promising data on the mosaic vaccine from another ongoing study, a larger human efficacy trial will move forward toward the end of the year in southern Africa, involving some 2,600 healthy, HIV-negative women.

Deaths from AIDS have halved since 2005 — but there’s still a ton of work to be done

We’ve made remarkable progress against HIV around the world. In 1996, as HIV prevalence was peaking around the world, the United Nations established UNAIDS, the first global health body focused on a single disease. In 2000, the UN Security Council convened an unprecedented meeting to address the out-of-control AIDS crisis. This led to a massive concentration of resources into HIV/AIDS research, and triggered global and coordinated efforts to stem the disease.

Researchers and doctors figured out how to get people tested and diagnosed quickly, and uncovered effective treatments that allowed those with HIV to live long, relatively healthy lives. Public health officials also waged awareness campaigns about prevention, reminding people to practice safe sex with condoms and get tested, and that early HIV treatment can save lives. Recently, researchers even discovered a pill to prevent HIV.

Deaths from AIDS have halved to 1 million since 2005, and UNAIDS estimates almost 20 million people now have access to treatment. (Some of that access is now in jeopardy, however, given that President Donald Trump has proposed cutting $800 million from a key US government AIDS program called PEPFAR in the 2018 budget.)

An HIV vaccine has long been elusive. The other HIV vaccine in human testing, the HVTN 702 candidate, is a newer version of the only other HIV vaccine to show any efficacy in humans, called RV144. In a trial on the RV144, 31 percent of people who got the vaccine did not develop HIV — too small a number to be useful. But with the new HVTN trial, researchers hope some tweaks to the vaccine might boost the efficacy rate.

“A safe and effective HIV vaccine would be a powerful tool to reduce new HIV infections worldwide and help bring about a durable end to the HIV/AIDS pandemic,” Fauci said in a statement. “By exploring multiple promising avenues of vaccine development research, we expand our opportunities to achieve these goals.”"	There's a promising new HIV vaccine candidate in the pipeline	2017-07-24 06:00:00	https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/7/24/16019590/hiv-vaccine-international-aids-society-conference	story_reviews_00196	true
"Scientists have slowed down the ageing process by implanting stem cells into the brains of animals, raising hopes for new strategies to combat age-related diseases and extend the human lifespan.

Implants of stem cells that make fresh neurons in the brain were found to put the brakes on ageing in older mice, keeping them more physically and mentally fit for months, and extending their lives by 10-15% compared to untreated animals.

Umbilical cord blood could slow brain's ageing, study suggests Read more

The work, described as a tour de force and a breakthrough by one leading expert, suggests that ageing across the body is controlled by stem cells that are found in the hypothalamus region of the brain in youth, but which steadily die off until they are almost completely absent in middle age.

Researchers at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York hope to launch clinical trials of the procedure soon, but must first produce supplies of human neural stem cells in the lab which can be implanted into volunteers.

“Of course humans are more complex,” said Dongsheng Cai, who led the research. “However, if the mechanism is fundamental, you might expect to see effects when an intervention is based on it.”

Previous experiments had already hinted that the hypothalamus, an almond-sized part of the brain in humans, played some role in the ageing process, but what it was remained unclear. The latest investigation from the US team pinpoints which cells are important and how they might work.

In the first of a series of experiments in mice, Cai showed that neural stem cells, which are found in a handful of brain regions at birth, disappear from the hypothalamus over time. The stem cells are known to form fresh brain cells in youth, but the process slows down dramatically in adults. Though small, the hypothalamus forms a crucial connection between the body’s nervous and hormonal systems.

To test whether the decline in stem cells was causing ageing, and not itself a result of old age, the researchers injected mice with a toxin that wiped out 70% of their neural stem cells. The effect was striking. Over the next few months the mice aged more rapidly than usual, and performed much worse than control animals on a battery of tests of endurance, coordination, social behaviour and ability to recognise objects. “Behaviourally mice aged faster when these cells were removed during early ageing,” Cai told the Guardian. The animals died months earlier than healthy control animals.

Next, the scientists looked at what happened when aged mice received injections of fresh neural stem cells. This time the mice lived longer than controls, typically several months more, an increase of about 15%. If a similar extension was achieved in humans, a person with a life expectancy of 80 years could live to 92.

Maximum human lifespan could far exceed 115 years – new research Read more

Having proved that it was neural stem cells that were important for ageing, the scientists ran further tests to work out what the cells were doing. They found that molecules called microRNAs, or miRNAs, that are released from neural stem cells were responsible for most of the ageing effects. When the molecules are produced in the hypothalamus, they flow into the clear fluid in the brain and spinal cord and affect how genes operate.

“The mechanism is partially due to these cells secreting certain miRNAs which help maintain youth, and the loss of these leads to ageing” said Cai, whose study is published in Nature. The next step is to create human neural stem cells in the lab for testing.

“It is a tour de force,” said David Sinclair at Harvard Medical School. “It’s a breakthrough. The brain controls how long we live. I can see a day when we are implanted with stem cells or treated with stem cell RNAs that improve our health and extend our lives. I would love to know which brain stem cell secretions extend a mouse’s lifespan and if human stem cells make them too.”"	Stem cell brain implants could 'slow ageing and extend life', study shows	2017-07-26 06:00:00	https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jul/26/stem-cell-brain-implants-could-slow-ageing-and-extend-life-study-shows	story_reviews_00195	true
"Alzheimer’s disease now affects an estimated 5.5 million Americans, and after decades of feverish work, researchers have so far failed to find a treatment that halts or reverses the inexorable loss of memory, function and thinking ability that characterize this feared illness.

But researchers have been quite successful at devising ways to diagnose Alzheimer’s earlier and earlier. And that capability has emerged alongside evidence of a tantalizing possibility: that if you can catch the disease early enough — ideally when symptoms of confusion or memory loss are just emerging, or before — some therapies already in hand might essentially halt its progress.

For anyone who detects some mental slippage and wonders, “Is it Alzheimer’s?” the current state of dementia research raises a very real, and very wrenching, dilemma: If I can know, do I want to know?

That is, if it’s Alzheimer’s disease, would I do anything differently? Would there be some benefit in knowing for my loved ones, for myself?

Doctors and insurers, including the federal government, which administers Medicare, are asking some variants of the same questions: If an effective test, which costs between $3,000 and $5,000 a shot, can diagnose dementia early, and distinguish Alzheimer’s from other forms of dementia, should it be recommended to patients with cognitive concerns and routinely covered by their insurance? Would it make patients’ lives better, or lower the cost of their care?

Newly unveiled research results are bringing some clarity to such deliberations. And other new research, published Wednesday in the journal Neurology, proposes a new diagnostic tool that may be able to detect Alzheimer’s, and distinguish it from another form of dementia, more simply and cheaply than does the best test now available.

At the Alzheimer’s Assn. International Conference in London last week, researchers reported their preliminary findings from a trial that is testing the impact of diagnostic testing for Alzheimer’s disease on nearly 19,000 Medicare beneficiaries.

All of these study participants — largely people in their 70s, all with a diagnosis of either “mild cognitive impairment” or atypical dementia — are living with the unconfirmed suspicion that they have Alzheimer’s. The study is underwritten by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Alzheimer’s Assn. It set out to find out whether knowing — getting the costly test that would offer either confirmation or reprieve — would change the way that patients with cognitive troubles are treated, or the way that they plan their lives.

The preliminary results suggested it did. After getting the results of a PET brain scan to detect and measure amyloid deposits, which are the key hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease, roughly two-thirds of the subjects saw their medication regimens changed or were counseled differently by their doctors about what to expect.

That new information may have guided family caregivers in planning their own futures, or prodded patients to make financial decisions and power-of-attorney assignments sooner. Some who learned that they did not have Alzheimer’s discontinued medications that can have unpleasant side effects. Others learned they do have Alzheimer’s and decided to enroll in clinical trials that will test new drugs.

A second study presented in London analyzed data from several studies, and found that in a large population of research participants with cognitive concerns, brain amyloid PET scans led to a change in diagnosis in approximately 20% of cases.

“People should know what’s coming,” said Dr. Maria Carrillo, chief science officer for the Alzheimer’s Assn. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has given amyloid scans a provisional approval, meaning they do not routinely pay for them. The results may guide the agency to rethink its position, she added.

The PET scan bore bad news for Ken Lehmann, who enrolled last year in the IDEAS trial, short for Imaging Dementia — Evidence for Amyloid Scanning. After his long, slow decline that has flummoxed doctors, Lehmann’s brain scan clearly showed he has Alzheimer’s disease.

The certainty that has brought has been a long time coming. When Lehmann began withdrawing from friends, forgetting to pay bills and having trouble following conversations, he was just 58. Now, he’s 80.

Ken had always been considered a “Renaissance man” — a furniture company executive who rebuilt Porsches, played basketball and loved to entertain friends, said his wife, Mary Margaret Lehmann. But as years passed, his judgment seemed off. He would lose track of points he was making, and sometimes of where he was at.

It would take the loss of their home and a business bankruptcy for the Lehmanns to demand answers to what was going on. In 2009, they moved from Sacramento to Edina, Minn., to live with a daughter. And there, at last, they found a neurologist who, despite initial skepticism (“but he presents so well!” the doctor proclaimed), diagnosed dementia.

For the Lehmanns and many patients and families like them — as well as for neurologists — that diagnosis is often just the beginning of a deeper mystery.

Alzheimer’s disease is the most feared and most common form of dementia, accounting for between 60% and 80% of all dementia cases diagnosed. But at least seven other forms of dementia, and dementia linked to the movement disorder Parkinson’s disease, can cause loss of memory, reasoning, judgment and the ability to speak, comprehend and care for oneself.

To the estimated 16 million Americans living with some form of cognitive impairment, telling the difference could make a significant difference. Dementia forms with different origins progress differently (or sometimes not at all). They respond best to different medications, and will come to require different levels of care and treatment. Some (though not Alzheimer’s) can even be reversed with treatment.

Being able to distinguish which form of dementia a patient has should help doctors and caregivers to make better choices.

But it’s a question that until recently could be answered only after death. At that point, a postmortem examination of the brain could be done to look for the built-up clumps and tangles of beta-amyloid proteins, the overall shrinkage, and the loss of neurons in the brain’s hippocampus that are, collectively, the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s.

No more. Improved medical imaging technologies developed over the last decade have made it possible to peer inside the brain of a living patient, detect and measure the accumulation of beta-amyloid, and make a definitive diagnosis.

In 2012, the Food and Drug Administration took a first step in making such imaging possible, giving its blessing to the imaging agent florbetapir F18, which binds to amyloid aggregates in the brain and allows a PET scan to be used to make the diagnosis. In 2013, two new imaging agents won FDA approval, and new imaging agents and techniques promise ever more precise means to visualize and diagnose Alzheimer’s in the brain.

On Wednesday, research published in the journal Neurology suggested that transcranial magnetic stimulation, a technique that can selectively turn up or down activity in different parts of the brain, could prove useful in distinguishing between Alzheimer’s disease from frontotemporal dementia.

In many ways, Ken Lehmann’s symptoms fit neatly into a diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia. A form of cognitive impairment that typically becomes evident earlier than most cases of Alzheimer’s, FTD often affects judgment, personality and verbal communication. This form of dementia progresses as inexorably as does Alzheimer’s. But its typical course differs slightly.

As an enrollee in the IDEAS trial, Lehmann was prepared to learn what it was he had.

“I had come to the conclusion they just don’t know,” said Lehmann, now 80, from his home in Minnesota. “In seven years, my journey of decline has been very miniscule, and they don’t know why.”

It turns out, he added, “I have all the biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease.”

Once he and his wife learned that, they stepped up their preparations for further decline. And they redoubled their efforts to do things that bring joy, and that may slow Ken’s decline as well.

They follow a diet rich in fatty fish, healthful fats and fruits and vegetables, and Ken does woodworking. He also sings in a Minneapolis chorus, Giving Voice, with other dementia patients. He has regained a long-lost ability to read music.

“Just not knowing is very disconcerting,” says Mary Margaret, who is her husband’s principal caregiver. “I don’t know what the timeline is, but I now know what the needs are, in terms of financial and legal needs and end-of-life issues. Those all need to be planned for ahead of time, and now we have all of that in place. To me, that’s a safety net.”

"When Sierra Riddle stormed into the conference room at Denver’s child protective services office, the director of the agency was seated there, along with her son’s team of doctors, top administrators from the Children’s Hospital Colorado oncology department and lawyers. She recalls looking one of the physicians in the eye, defiant. “I’m done with this shit,” she remembers saying. “I’m done with you guys bullying us.”

Then, she took out a bag and dumped the contents on the table: nine months of cancer drugs prescribed to her son, Landon, who was 4 at the time. He had been diagnosed more than a year before with an aggressive form of leukemia and undergone months of grueling treatment. But his mother was now refusing to follow his doctors’ orders. “Listen: Here’s all this chemo you told CPS he cannot live without, and if I didn’t give it to him, he would relapse and die.”

But Landon, who underwent only one year of cancer treatment instead of the recommended four, was still alive—thriving, in fact—even though he’d stopped taking that massive pile of drugs prescribed for him. That’s why his mother had called this meeting. She implored the CPS director—whom by then she knew by first name—to restrain the oncologists who had threatened to take her child away and put him in foster care. Riddle believes the doctors wanted to prove she was a neglectful, abusive mother, but she knew she could convince the world that the hospital was wrong about her son’s treatment. (Due to HIPAA patient privacy laws, Children’s Hospital Colorado was unable to comment on Landon’s case for this story.)

Landon’s cancer, diagnosed in September 2012, had put Riddle in a situation that’s any parent’s worst nightmare: She had to watch him undergo lifesaving treatment that appeared to be killing him. Riddle says she was left with no choice but to defy his doctors’ orders.

RELATED: What we know about how cancer starts could all be wrong

In January 2013, nearly four months after Landon’s initial diagnosis, the two went from Utah to Colorado, where Riddle purchased an alternative treatment fraught with complicated politics and plenty of skepticism—especially when it comes to saving the life of a preschooler with a potentially fatal disease. At the time, Colorado was one of only about a dozen states in the U.S. that had legalized medical cannabis. It also allowed sick children to access the drug under professional guidance. Landon became the youngest patient in the U.S. at that time to receive a medical marijuana card. Riddle’s decision to treat her child with cannabis landed the family in the center of a contentious national debate, as well as on prime-time television with CNN’s chief medical correspondent, Sanjay Gupta. In Utah, all cannabis is illegal, so when their story went public, she and Landon had to move permanently to Colorado, so he could continue to have access to the drug. Even now, at 7, he still needs to take cannabis to cope with the long-term effects of chemotherapy and radiation, she says.

By the time of that showdown with CPS and Landon’s doctors in Denver, Riddle had stopped giving her son all of the drugs prescribed by the hospital: the chemo, opiates and benzos. The latter two—which included OxyContin, morphine and Ativan—were prescribed to help Landon cope with the side effects of cancer treatment. None of them helped, she says, or they made him feel worse. But when Landon started the cannabis oil, his health miraculously improved. She was willing to do whatever it took to keep him on cannabis.

A Key in the Lock

As laws that permit medical cannabis have expanded nationwide (29 states in the country now permit some form of cannabis use for medical purposes), cancer patients increasingly use the drug to alleviate the harsh symptoms of chemotherapy, such as nausea, anxiety, loss of appetite and insomnia. But there’s also an emerging body of research that suggests marijuana might be effective as a treatment for cancer on its own, or in conjunction with standard therapies.

When Riddle made the decision to give her son cannabis, the information on its safety and efficacy was (and still is) limited to anecdotal accounts, a handful of case reports and lab studies published in obscure medical journals. Initially, her hope was that the drug would lessen the side effects. But Riddle soon heard that certain compounds in cannabis—cannabinoids—have been shown to induce cancer cell death. The theory seemed to be especially promising for leukemia, at least according to studies done on cancer cells in test tubes and on mice injected with human leukemia cells. But at that point there wasn’t any evidence it would work for humans. There still isn’t. While cannabis is legal in many U.S. states, the drug is still classified by the Drug Enforcement Administration as a Schedule 1 narcotic (along with heroin and cocaine), which make it very difficult for scientists to conduct clinical trials on people. However, that may change as other nations, such as Israel, take the lead and fund marijuana research.

Ryan David Brown for Newsweek

The findings so far from published lab studies suggest cannabidiol (CBD), one of more than 100 cannabinoids present in the plant, targets certain pathways in leukemia. The evidence indicates that leukemia cells have a high number of cannabinoid receptors—primarily the receptor CB2. The proteins on the cell membrane (receptors) recognize the chemical compound, CBD. The shape of the receptor mirrors the shape of the compound, enabling the CBD to land and attach to the cell. “It’s like a key in the lock,” says Dr. Bonni Goldstein, medical director of Canna-Centers in Los Angeles and the medical adviser to Weedmaps.com, a resource for people seeking specialists to oversee their medical cannabis treatment. “When compounds such as cannabidiol bond to receptors, it causes the cell to die.”

Further studies are needed to verify that CBD could potentially kill leukemia, says Robert McKallip, an associate professor of immunology at Mercer University School of Medicine, who conducted some of the earliest research on the anti-leukemia properties of compounds found in cannabis. McKallip suggests cannabis could be used along with other treatments for leukemia. “Combined with other targeted therapies, which again, specifically target the leukemia, you give it a one-two punch and hopefully reduce side effects and improve efficacy of treatment,” he says.

Riddle isn’t a doctor, but she theorizes that while the chemo initially cleared Landon’s cancer, it’s the cannabis that has kept his disease from coming back. Oncologists who treat pediatric patients often tell families that when the five-year mark passes, their child is in the clear. It’s been nearly five years since Riddle sat in that conference room meeting; Landon is still cancer-free. Riddle says that once he hits the five-year mark this fall, he’ll set a precedent for pediatric leukemia patients in the U.S., and maybe even worldwide.

‘He’s Dying’

Riddle, a single mother, was willing to do whatever it would take to rid Landon of the cancer in his blood that had spread to his brain and formed a tumor in his chest the size of a large grapefruit. She desperately wanted to trust the doctors at the Huntsman Cancer Institute in Salt Lake City, where her son was diagnosed at age 2, and who admitted to her that they weren’t sure they could save his life.

She knew the leukemia treatment protocols are backed by decades of research. But they are infamously rough for a child and drag on for years. First, there would be several months of aggressive inpatient chemo and other therapies for what’s known as “remission reduction.” After that, even when blood work showed the disease had entered remission, Landon would need years of chemo and monitoring—called “consolidation”—to make sure his body wasn’t harboring leukemia cells.

This aggressive approach is one of the main reasons pediatric leukemia, depending on its more specific classification, has at least an 80 to 90 percent survival rate. The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society estimates that nearly 5,000 kids will be diagnosed in the U.S. with some form of leukemia in 2017. For most of the kids who go through the entire course of treatment, the illness turns out to be a mere blip on the screen of childhood. Riddle hoped the same would be true for her son. But Landon appeared to be among a small percentage of children with leukemia for whom the treatment was unbearable, excruciating. The chemo caused him to vomit up to 50 times a day, which made it difficult for him to speak because his esophagus was burned and closed up. The chemo had compromised his immune system so severely that he caught every bug in the hospital, just about every strain of stomach viruses, influenza and the common cold. He eventually developed numbness, tingling, pain and weakness (neuropathy) in his feet and ankles, and was no longer able to walk.

Within the first 90 days of treatment, Landon lost half his body weight. He stopped eating for more than a month. He needed blood and platelet transfusions. Doctors kept adding prescription after prescription to alleviate the side effects of treatment—narcotics, anti-depressants, anti-anxiety drugs, prescriptions for pain. “The sad thing is they didn’t seem to help Landon,” she says. “At this point, they kept telling us we have to keep going. I said, ‘He’s dying. It’s very apparent that he’s dying.’”

Landon began to refuse chemotherapy and turn into a “little psychopath,” says Riddle. He kicked and screamed when nurses forced pills into his mouth, so eventually everything needed to be administered with an IV. “The chemo actually has healed a lot of kids, but it almost killed me,” he says.

Ryan David Brown for Newsweek

Most children with leukemia go into remission within the first 30 days of treatment, which was why Landon’s doctors insisted on several more years of chemotherapy, says Riddle. By the time Landon was nearing the end of his first stage of treatment, Riddle says her son was on the brink of death. The doctors told her to bring him home for a two-week break from chemo, adding that they would arrange to send a hospice nurse—an ominous hint that Landon was about to die.

A plea for help posted on Facebook by Riddle’s mother, Wendy, led the family to a group of brothers in Denver, the Stanleys, who were cultivating cannabis for medicinal purposes and had made the news for a strain they called Charlotte’s Web. Riddle and her mother had seen the story about Charlotte Figi, a 6-year-old girl with Dravet syndrome, a rare type of epilepsy that was unresponsive to standard treatment. She had up to 300 seizures per day. But the seizures stopped when she began taking CBD oil supplied by the brothers.

The Stanleys visited the Riddles in Utah to educate them about Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)—the psychoactive chemical in the plant—and CBD. She decided to start Landon on cannabis. But to do that, the family would need to leave Utah, where all cannabis is illegal. So Riddle and Landon moved in with the brothers for about a year, says Joel Stanley, the CEO of the company that is now known as CW Hemp. “It was just so sad to see someone that young and that small going through such harsh treatment,” Stanley says of Landon. “He also had elements of what I know a lot of folks would call ‘chemo brain.’ He would get very frustrated and very angry, all normal because his little body was just being invaded by this intense medication and rounds of chemotherapy treatment.” Throughout that year, Riddle and her son traveled back and forth from Colorado to Utah, so he could continue chemo, but this time with the aid of cannabis, to make treatment more bearable. That meant Riddle had the drug on hand, and Landon was under its influence while in Utah, which made mother and son both felons.

RELATED: Personalized cancer vaccines edge closer after success in human clinical trials

Nearly all of the children the brothers had worked with by then were refractory epilepsy patients. The Stanleys had gotten their start a few years before with adults who wanted to manage cancer, and Landon was their first pediatric cancer patient.

Riddle began her son on Charlotte’s Web CBD oil and eventually added THC. As Riddle titrated the THC dosing, she slowly weaned her son off the narcotics prescribed for him by his doctors in Utah. Stanley says the combination of CBD oil and THC helped Landon deal with the side effects of chemotherapy and, based on limited existing lab research, made it more likely that the cannabis could kill the cancer as well. “If the cannabinoids do in his body what they have proven to do in petri dishes and in mice, why not throw the book at them?”

Ryan David Brown for Newsweek

By then, CNN had started to follow Landon’s story. The network planned to broadcast the segment after he and his mother had returned to Utah, packed up their car with their possessions and drove to their new home in Colorado, where Landon could continue to take cannabis. But CNN aired a promotion for the premiere of the episode before they had left for Colorado. The oncologist at the hospital in Utah who oversaw Landon’s treatment granted them discharge anyway and told Riddle she better leave the state immediately.

Riddle says she was shocked to find that the doctors at the children’s hospital in Denver weren’t on her side. She says the hospital called CPS on her more than a dozen times when it became aware that she was no longer complying with treatment.

That is why she ended up in that conference room with a cannabis researcher, who was there to explain why the drug could help patients like Landon. He was the only person in the medical field she could find who would speak on her behalf. “It was a big slap in the face that not a single doctor would come forward to help us,” she says. “They were all afraid of losing their medical license. They were afraid of the government. They were afraid of what it would look like if they came forward in the name of cannabis.”

In the end, CPS supported Riddle. Results from blood tests, a bone marrow biopsy and spinal tap proved Landon no longer had leukemia, not even the microscopic kind, she says. Riddle says the CPS director called the hospital and ordered it to have Landon’s chemo port removed and discharge him from the hospital.

Today, Landon is still coping with the impact of his treatment. In addition to digestive problems, he has post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. The cannabis vape pen helps with that, says Riddle. She says the cranial radiation he had to endure caused some neurological deficits, and Landon says he worries that he’ll be sick forever.

But there’s so much good news here. He’s alive, and he and his mother are no longer just “medical marijuana refugees.” They’re also activists. Along with other parents, she helped draft a bill and pass a state law that allows Landon and other children like him with chronic illnesses to take cannabis at school. (Since the drug is federally illegal, it had been illegal at school. That’s no longer the case in Colorado.)

They’ve testified in California on behalf of a medical marijuana caregiver whose home was raided by the federal government, helping the man avoid a 35-year jail sentence. The mother and son have also traveled back to Utah to appear at a state congressional hearing for a medical marijuana bill that’s been shot down twice, which means they won’t be going home anytime soon.

At public appearances, Riddle does most of the talking, but she says as Landon has grown up, he has become more aware of his health problems stemming from his cancer treatment. And also angrier. “Eventually, he’ll be the one telling the story, and I’ll just be the one supporting him.”"	Cancer and Kids: Is Medical Marijuana the Answer?	2017-07-28 06:00:00	https://web.archive.org/web/20170719032114/http://www.newsweek.com/2017/07/28/medical-marijuana-pediatric-cancer-637676.html	story_reviews_00200	true
"Copenhagen, Denmark, July 7, 2017 - Researchers from the Department of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports at the University of Copenhagen today announced the findings from a weight loss biomarker study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (AJCN). The study, ""Pretreatment fasting plasma glucose and insulin modify dietary weight loss success: results from 3 randomized clinical trials,"" found that fasting blood sugar and/or fasting insulin can be used to select the optimal diet and to predict weight loss, particularly for people with prediabetes or diabetes.

The research analyzed data from three diet clinical trials which collectively looked at more than 1,200 individuals - Diet, Obesity, and Genes (DiOGenes); the OPUS Supermarket intervention (SHOPUS); and the Nutrient-gene interactions in human obesity (NUGENOB). The findings suggest that for most people with prediabetes, a diet rich with vegetables fruits and wholegrains should be recommended for weight loss and could potentially improve diabetes markers. For people with type 2 diabetes, the analysis found that a diet rich in healthy fats from plant sources would be effective for achieving weight loss. These diets could also be effective independent of caloric restriction.

Two simple biomarkers with a large effect

""Recognizing fasting plasma glucose as a key biomarker enables a new interpretation of the data from many previous studies, which could potentially lead to a breakthrough in personalized nutrition,"" said Arne Astrup, M.D., Head of Department of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports at University of Copenhagen. ""The beauty of this concept is its simplicity. While we are looking into other biomarkers, it is quite amazing how much more we can do for our patients just by using those two simple biomarkers. We will continue to participate in and support research to explore additional biomarkers such as gut microbiota and genomics approaches, which may offer more insights and help to more effectively customize the right diet for specific individuals.""

The latest findings, as reported in AJCN, have garnered international support with further analysis conducted by researchers from the University of Colorado, Tufts University, and Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Fisiopatología de la Obesidad y Nutrición (CIBER OBN). Presented at the American Diabetes Association's 77th Scientific Sessions on June 11, 2017, the additional research includes an examination of patients in the Prevencion Dieta Mediterranea (PREDIMED Study), a Randomized Trial of a Low-CHO Diet for Obesity (CHO Study), and The Healthy Weight for Living Study. The different studies (six in total) employed a variety of nutrition strategies, including caloric restriction and ad libitum diets, varying the contributions of carbohydrate and fat, and increasing fiber intake.

The study was inspired by a finding in an early trial of Gelesis100, a novel hydrogel which demonstrated pronounced weight loss in people with prediabetes. The latest findings, as published in AJCN, concluded that a personalized nutritional approach based on an individual's biomarkers will lead to improved weight loss and maintenance success. The University of Copenhagen will continue to collaborate with the study's authors and other experts to advance this research and help find solutions for people around the world who struggle with weight loss.

"BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -- The use of medication to treat attention deficient hyperactivity disorder is linked to significantly lower risk for substance use problems in adolescents and adults with ADHD, according to a study led by researchers at Indiana University.

The risk of substance use problems during periods of medication use was 35 percent lower in men and 31 percent lower in women in the study. The results, based upon nearly 3 million people with ADHD in the United States, are reported in the American Journal of Psychiatry.

""This study contributes to growing evidence that ADHD medication is linked to lower risk for many types of harmful behavior, including substance abuse,"" said Patrick D. Quinn, a postdoctoral researcher in the IU Bloomington College of Arts and Sciences' Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, who led the study. ""The results also highlight the importance of careful diagnosis and compliance with treatment.""

As one of the largest analyses on the risks and benefits of ADHD medication, the study drew on anonymous health care data from 146 million people with employer-based health insurance in the United States from 2005 to 2014.

Specifically, the researchers mined the data to identify people with ADHD whose records showed periods of ADHD medication use and periods without ADHD medication use -- as well as one or more visits to the emergency room due to drug or alcohol use. They then calculated the odds of the visits occurring during the person's use of ADHD medication versus the same person's non-use of ADHD medication.

""Many factors can influence who receives ADHD treatment, including socioeconomic factors, health care access, the strength of support networks and disorder severity,"" Quinn said. ""Although no single study of real-world treatment practices can definitively show whether medication use lowers risk, studying the same people at different points in their medical history helps us control for these factors and isolate the role of medication in their behavior.""

Of the nearly 3 million people with ADHD in the study's database, about 57 percent experienced periods in which they were and were not prescribed medication to treat the disorder. About 2 percent experienced an emergency room visit due to substance abuse. The median age of the study's participants was 21 for men and 28 for women.

The majority of the ADHD medicines used in the study were stimulants such as Adderall, an amphetamine, and Ritalin, or methylphenidate. A significantly smaller number used nonstimulant ADHD medication such as Strattera, or atomoxetine.

""While concerns about prescribing medications to treat ADHD that have the potential for abuse are understandable, this study provides further evidence that the use of these medications is not associated with increased risk of substance use problems in adolescence or adulthood,"" Quinn said. ""Rather, this and other recent studies find that the risk of such problems is lower during and after periods of use of these medications.""

Quinn is a member of the lab of Brian M. D'Onofrio, a professor in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences. Another study from this group recently reported in JAMA Psychiatry found that the use of ADHD medication was associated with lower risk of motor vehicle accidents in men and women.

D'Onofrio is also a co-author of several studies based on patient data from Sweden that found similarly lower risk for substance abuse and transport accidents in people with ADHD who used medication.

The larger number of people in the two more recent studies -- as well as the use of U.S. patients in the new analyses -- strengthens this earlier evidence.

""Together, these studies provide accumulating evidence about the possible short- and long-term benefits of ADHD medications,"" D'Onofrio said. ""They also provide important information to medical providers who prescribe ADHD medication -- as well as to adults with the disorder and parents trying to make medical decisions for children. Overall, I think people should find these results reassuring.""

"Playing football can improve bone development in adolescent boys, new research shows.

In a study comparing adolescent footballers to swimmers, cyclists and a control group of boys not involved in regular sport, scientists at the University of Exeter found football led to significantly better bones after one year of training.

Adolescence is the key period for bone development, and poor development at this stage is linked to reduced peak bone mass (the amount of bone mass at the end of the skeletal maturation, around age 30), increased fracture risk and osteoporosis later in life.

Though swimming and cycling have proven health benefits, the scientists said their study ""raises a question"" about whether they are good for bone development due to the non-weight bearing training - and they say young swimmers and cyclists could benefit from more weight-bearing exercise in training regimes.

""Our research shows that playing football can improve bone development in comparison to swimming and cycling,"" said first author Dimitris Vlachopoulos, of Sport and Health Sciences at the University of Exeter.

""Though we focussed on aspiring professionals who played as much as nine hours a week, playing football for three hours a week might be enough for a substantial effect.

""We already knew exercise was key for bone growth, but here we clarify what type of exercise.

""Although we didn't study other sports, it's reasonable to suppose that weight-bearing, high-impact, high-intensity exercise like tennis, badminton, basketball and handball will have similar effects to football.""

The year-long study, of 116 boys aged 12-14, took a variety of measures including bone mineral content (BMC).

BMC measurements were taken at the lumbar spine (lower back) and femoral neck (upper leg) - both key sites for both fractures and osteoporosis.

The results showed footballers had higher BMC than swimmers and cyclists after one year of sport-specific training.

For example, footballers' BMC was 7% higher than that of cyclists at the lumbar spine, and 5% higher at the femoral neck.

The research was funded by the EU via a Marie-Sklodowska-Curie fellowship awarded to principal investigator Dr Luis Gracia-Marco, also of the University of Exeter.

Dr Gracia-Marco said: ""The sports we studied are the three most popular in the UK, and it's important to know what effects they have in relation to bone health.

""Adolescence is the key time for bone growth. Once a person reaches puberty, the next five years are vitally important in this respect.""

The athletes in the study were all playing high-level sport - the footballers in Exeter City FC's youth setup, and the swimmers and cyclists at leading clubs in the South West.

The boys in the control group, though generally active, were not involved in regular sport.

Despite the many health benefits of cycling and swimming, the study found little difference in bone development between cyclists, swimmers and the control group.

""This raises a question about whether swimming and cycling are good for bone development,"" Dr Gracia Marco said.

""We now need to consider how to counteract the lack of bone growth stimulus caused by cycling and swimming, possibly by encouraging swimmers and cyclists to add weight-bearing exercise in their training.""

One innovative aspect of the study was the measurement of bone texture of the lumbar spine using trabecular bone score (TBS) - the first use of this technique in adolescent athletes.

The paper, entitled: ""Longitudinal Adaptations of Bone Mass, Geometry and Metabolism in Adolescent Male Athletes. The PRO-BONE Study"", is published in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research.

The research is part of a larger University of Exeter study called PRO-BONE.

"Australian researchers have completed the world's first randomised control trial (RCT) assessing the efficacy and safety of ketamine as a treatment for depression in elderly patients.

The results, published in the latest American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry, provide preliminary evidence suggesting ketamine's effectiveness as an antidepressant when delivered in repeated intravenous doses.

Led by a team of researchers from UNSW Sydney and Black Dog Institute, the trial tested different doses of ketamine amongst 16 older age participants (aged over 60 years) who had treatment-resistant depression, administered at Wesley Hospital.

""These findings take us a big step forward as we begin to fully understand the potential and limitations of ketamine's antidepressant qualities,"" said lead author UNSW Professor Colleen Loo, who is based at Black Dog Institute.

""Not only was ketamine well-tolerated by participants, with none experiencing severe or problematic side effects, but giving the treatment by a simple subcutaneous injection (a small injection under the skin) was also shown to be an acceptable method for administering the drug in a safe and effective way.""

Participants received increasing doses of ketamine over a period of five weeks, with doses optimised for each individual participant using a new dose-titration approach developed by Professor Loo's Sydney research team and collaborators.

As part of the double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, an active control treatment which causes sedation similar to ketamine, was used to substitute for one of the treatment sessions. Researchers monitored for mood and other side-effects after each treatment session.

Following the RCT, participants also received 12 ketamine treatments in an open-label phase to investigate the effectiveness of multiple doses of ketamine.

By the six-month follow up, 43 percent of participants (7 of 14) who completed the RCT had remitted, with five remitting at amounts below the commonly-used dose of 0.5 mg/kg. Repeated treatments also resulted in a higher likelihood of remission or a longer time to relapse, with an overall response and remission rate of 68.8 percent for the patients receiving ketamine treatment.

""Elderly patients with severe depression face additional barriers when seeking treatment for the condition. Many medications may cause more side effects or have lower efficacy as the brain ages,"" said co-author Dr Duncan George from UNSW Sydney. ""Older people are also more likely to have co-morbidities like neurodegenerative disorders and chronic pain, which can cause further complications due to ketamine's reported side effects. ""Our results indicate a dose-titration method may be particularly useful for older patients, as the best dose was selected for each individual person to maximise ketamine's benefits while minimising its adverse side effects.""

Previous studies into ketamine treatments for older people with depression - which are limited to just five case reports - show mixed success, with findings limited by small sample sizes.

More broadly, little is known about ketamine's potential side effects at different doses, which include cognitive and dissociative effects, elevated blood pressure and heart rate, liver inflammation and urinary problems.

""These results are a promising early piece of the puzzle, but the risks of ketamine use are still not wholly understood. Future studies with greater sample sizes are needed to formally assess ketamine's side effects, such as its impact on liver function,"" Professor Loo added.

###

The study was a collaboration between UNSW Sydney, Black Dog Institute, Royal North Shore Hospital, The Wesley Hospital Kogarah, the Dementia Collaborative Research Centre and the University of Otago.

Professor Loo will build on these promising results as part of her current work directing the world's largest trial of ketamine to treat depression, which is now recruiting participants.

"Attaching curcumin, a component of the common spice turmeric, to nanoparticles can be used to target and destroy treatment-resistant neuroblastoma tumor cells, according to a new study published in Nanoscale.

The study, conducted in partnership by researchers at Nemours Children's Hospital and the University of Central Florida, demonstrates a potentially novel treatment for neuroblastoma, the most common cancer in infants.

""High-risk neuroblastoma can be resistant to traditional therapy, and survival can be poor. This research demonstrates a novel method of treating this tumor without the toxicity of aggressive therapy that can also have late effects on the patient's health,"" said Tamarah J. Westmoreland, MD, PhD, a pediatric surgeon at Nemours Children's Health System and senior author of the study. ""Unique approaches to target tumor cells with nanoparticle delivery systems hold promise for treatment of resistant tumors, such as the high risk neuroblastoma. We are hopeful that in the future, nanoparticles can be utilized to personalize care to patients and reduce the late effects of therapy.""

Neuroblastomas are cancers that start in early nerve cells and commonly form in the tissue of the adrenal glands, near the kidneys. About 700 new cases of neuroblastoma are diagnosed each year in the United States and most cases appear in children younger than 5 years old. High-risk neuroblastoma is hard to cure and is more likely to become resistant to standard therapies or recur. These cancers are also associated with late effects after treatments have ended, including developmental delays, hearing loss, or other disabilities.

Curcumin has been shown to have substantial anti-cancer ability, but its low solubility and poor stability have made its use in medicinal applications challenging. Researchers from Nemours and UCF found that nanoparticles can be used to deliver curcumin to tumor sites.

""This shows that nanoparticles can be an effective delivery vehicle for cancer drugs,"" said Professor Sudipta Seal, who directs of UCF's NanoScience Technology Center and Advanced Materials Processing Analysis Center, and is a collaborator on the study. ""More research is needed, but we are hopeful it could lead to more effective treatment of this devastating disease in the future.""

In the study, researchers loaded Cerium oxide nanoparticles with curcumin and coated them with dextran to test in cell lines of a high-risk form of neuroblastoma, known as MYCN-amplified, as well as non-amplified neuroblastoma. This formulation induced substantial cell death in neuroblastoma cells while producing no or only minor toxicity in healthy cells. Overall, the nano-therapeutic treatments showed a more pronounced effect in MYCN-amplified cells, which are traditionally more resistant to drug therapies.

Nanoscience research, which explores the unusual properties of materials at the nanoscale, has led to advancements in medicine, energy, information storage, computing and other fields. At no more than 100 nanometers, nanoparticles are exceedingly small. By comparison, a sheet of paper is about 75,000 nanometers thick.

###

This study was conducted in a laboratory setting in Orlando, Fla., at Nemours Children's Hospital and the University of Central Florida in cells from children with neuroblastoma, but researchers hope to begin to use these curcumin nanoparticles with micro RNA in animal models to direct the molecule to a tumor site. This research is an excellent example of the collaboration between Nemours Children's Hospital and the University of Central Florida. Funding of this work was supported by the Nemours Foundation along with the regional economic development initiative of the Florida High Tech Corridor."

"HOUSTON - For patients with advanced, inoperable stage 3 lung cancer, concurrent chemotherapy and the specialized radiation treatment, proton therapy, offers improved survival compared to historical data for standard of care, according to a new study from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.

The research, published in JAMA Oncology, reported an overall survival (OS) of 26.5 months. In contrast, the historical OS rate with standard of care concurrent chemotherapy and traditional radiation was 16 months at the time when the study was designed.

The findings are the final results of the single institution, Phase II study and represent the longest follow-up to date of stage 3 lung cancer patients who have received proton therapy, said Joe Y. Chang, M.D., professor, Radiation Oncology and the study's corresponding author.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women in the U.S. According to the American Cancer Society, more than 222,500 people will be diagnosed and 155,870 will die from the disease in 2017, with the majority of patients still being diagnosed when the disease is in an advanced stage.

""Advanced lung cancer patients with inoperable disease traditionally have been treated with concurrent chemotherapy and conventional photon radiation therapy. However, the therapy can be very difficult for patients due to associated toxicities and because many patients are also dealing with comorbidities,"" explained Chang.

Proton therapy is an advanced type of radiation treatment that uses a beam of protons to deliver radiation directly to the tumor, destroying cancer cells while sparing healthy tissues. Protons enter the body with a low radiation dose and stop at the tumor, matching its shape and volume or depth. They deposit the bulk of their cancer-fighting energy right at the tumor, thereby reducing the dose to cardiopulmonary structures, which impacts the toxicity, functional status, quality of life and even survival for patients, explained Chang.

""With our study, we hypothesized that proton therapy would offer a survival benefit to patients and reduce treatment-associated toxicities, which can be very serious,"" he said.

The study opened at MD Anderson in 2006; in this research, Chang and his colleague report on the study's five-year results.

For the prospective Phase II trial, 64 patients with inoperable, Stage III non-small-cell lung cancer were enrolled. The study's primary endpoint was OS. The researchers hypothesized that the median OS would increase from historical data of 16 months on standard therapy to 24 months. Secondary endpoints included distant metastasis and local and regional recurrence rates. Toxic effects of treatment in both the acute and late settings also were analyzed.

Median follow up was 27.3 months for all patients, and 79.6 months for alive patients. At five years, the median OS was 26.5 months, and the corresponding five-year OS was 29 percent. Median progression-free survival was 12.9 months, with a five-year progression-free survival of 22 percent.

In sum, 39 patients experienced a relapse, with distant sites representing 62 percent of all recurrences. Local and regional recurrence rates were low, 16 percent and 14 percent, respectively.

Among the acute and late toxic effects diagnosed in patients were: esophagitis, pneumonitis and cardiac arrhythmia. Of note, said Chang, no patients developed the most severe, or grade five, toxicities, as seen in patients who receive standard of care.

Chang noted his study is not without limitations. Of greatest significance: the study was designed more than a decade ago. While the study's survival, recurrence rates and toxic effects are still favorable when compared to rates associated with the most advanced traditional photon radiation therapy, intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), technology to diagnose and stage the disease, as well all treatment modalities have significantly improved.

""When the study opened, PET imaging had just been approved for lung cancer staging. The image quality was poor and didn't include a CT component in most facilities across the country,"" said Chang. ""Obviously, the technology has improved dramatically over the last decade and has made a significant impact on diagnosis and staging. Also, delivery of both the conventional intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and proton therapy (IMPT), have improved, thereby reducing side effects for both treatment modalities.""

For example, MD Anderson proton therapy patients with advanced lung cancer now can receive IMPT. The technique uses an intricate network of magnets to aim a narrow proton beam at a tumor and ""paint"" the radiation dose onto it layer by layer. Healthy tissue surrounding the tumor is spared, and side effects are even more reduced than earlier proton delivery, said Chang.

A Phase II trial studying IMPT and concurrent chemotherapy is underway.

Chang also noted the advancements in cancer biology and immunotherapy and that both are important areas of research focus in combination with proton therapy.

"Researchers have identified two new biological markers of cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disease which affects children and young adults, leaving them with lifelong health complications including digestive problems and persistent lung infections.

The findings, published in the journal ACS Central Science, shed new light on the underlying mechanisms of CF and could lead to improved prognosis and better therapies for a disease which is quite variable, affecting different children in different ways, say researchers.

""There are chemical signatures in sweat that tell us an infant has CF,"" says Philip Britz-McKibbin, lead author of the study and a professor in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at McMaster University. ""We set out to discover whether there were chemical indicators detected in sweat that could complement the gold standard for CF diagnosis: the sweat chloride test.""

The test is commonly used in universal newborn disease-screening programs and measures the concentrations of salt. Elevated sweat chloride confirms that an infant actually has CF.

But there are some obstacles that complicate clinical decision-making, explains Britz-McKibbin, because sweat chloride can result in ambiguous diagnoses in some borderline cases and does not reveal how the disease might progress for individual patients.

""Sweat contains lots of information related to human health that researchers have not fully analyzed and we found some unexpected chemicals associated with CF,"" he says.

Using a specialized technique developed at McMaster, scientists collected and analyzed sweat samples from infants in CF clinics at the McMaster Children's Hospital and the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.

They identified several unknown chemicals beyond chloride that were consistently associated with babies who had CF, including two different drug and environmental compounds the infants secreted in sweat at much lower concentration levels.

Testing for these biomarkers could be done in cases in which the chloride sweat test result is unclear, say researchers. The biomarkers also point to other underlying mechanisms that contribute to the progression of CF and could lead to better therapeutic interventions earlier in life.

""The easier it is to detect CF, the earlier it can be diagnosed, and the better people's chances are at living a longer, healthier life"", says Joanna Valsamis, Chief Healthcare, Research and Advocacy Officer at Cystic Fibrosis Canada. ""CF Canada invests heavily in research that aims to improve the lives of people living with CF, and findings such as those from Dr. Britz-McKibbin are crucial to our understanding of the disease.""

In Canada, one in every 3,600 children are diagnosed with CF. But life expectancy rates have risen dramatically in recent decades with the median age of survival now over 50 years, due to better treatments to improve lung function, better nutrition and lung transplants. Further benefits are expected with the advent of newborn screening programs that have resulted in early detection.

"A comparison between less-expensive, over-the-counter hearing assistance devices and a conventional hearing aid found that some of these devices were associated with improvements in hearing similar to the hearing aid, according to a study published by JAMA.

Presently, hearing aids can only be purchased in the United States through a licensed professional, with an average cost of $4,700 for two hearing aids (uncovered by Medicare). According to nationally representative estimates, less than 20 percent of adults with hearing loss report hearing aid use. Personal sound amplification products (PSAPs) are less-expensive, over-the-counter devices not specifically labeled for hearing loss treatment, but some are technologically comparable with hearing aids and may be appropriate for mild to moderate hearing loss.

Nicholas S. Reed, Au.D., of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, and colleagues compared five of these devices (costs, approximately $350 to $30) with a conventional hearing aid (cost, $1,910) among 42 adults (average age, 72 years) with mild to moderate hearing loss.

The researchers found that the change in accuracy in speech understanding from unaided to aided varied by device. Three of the PSAPs were associated with improvements in speech understanding that were similar to results obtained with the hearing aid; one demonstrated little improvement; and speech understanding was worse with one PSAP.

""Results lend support to current national initiatives from the National Academies, White House, and bipartisan legislation requesting that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration create a new regulatory classification for hearing devices meeting appropriate specifications to be available over the counter,"" the authors write.

A limitation of the study was the modest number of participants.

"Physicians should consider blood testing of female adolescents for iron deficiency within a few years of starting menses, according to two studies by Penn State College of Medicine researchers.

The researchers used data from more than 6,000 women 12 to 49 years old who took part in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 2003 and 2010. As part of the survey, female participants had blood testing for iron deficiency as well as hemoglobin testing to identify anemia.

Women are typically tested some time in their teens for anemia -- the severe form of iron deficiency -- using a quick and affordable hemoglobin test. However, iron deficiency can develop years before anemia and can be missed by hemoglobin testing alone.

""If you think about your car, you have to run your gas tank all the way down before the red light goes on, and that's similar to the way we're screening for iron deficiency,"" said Deepa L. Sekhar, physician and associate professor of pediatrics. ""We're basically waiting until their red light goes on. You have to be really low on your iron storage before you're going to flag as anemic.""

Iron deficiency without anemia has been associated with lower standardized math scores, attention deficit disorder and restless leg syndrome in children and adolescents. Among iron-deficient adolescent women there is a future risk of maternal iron deficiency and negative effects on infant health.

Blood tests for iron deficiency without anemia have been developed but they are more costly and difficult to obtain in the doctor's office compared to hemoglobin testing for anemia. Sekhar and colleagues hoped to determine risk factors for iron deficiency without anemia that could pinpoint which women could benefit most from this more costly testing.

In the first study, when the researchers analyzed the NHANES study data, 9 percent of females who were 12 to 21 years old had iron deficiency without anemia. The researchers then looked at potential iron deficiency risk factors in this group, including the age when they started menstruating, as well as their race and ethnicity, poverty status, food insecurity, tobacco or nicotine use, dietary information, body mass index (BMI) and physical activity.

All of these factors have been associated with iron deficiency anemia in women in prior studies. However, the only risk factor significantly associated with iron deficiency without anemia in young women in this study was having had a period for more than three years. The research was recently published in the journal PLOS ONE.

In a second study, the researchers next looked at whether a specially developed questionnaire could better predict iron status. Questions were included on depression, poor attention and daytime sleepiness, symptoms which all have been associated with iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia, but were not captured in the prior NHANES analyses. This questionnaire was compared to the currently recommended four iron deficiency anemia-risk questions in the Bright Futures Adolescent Previsit Questionnaire, a survey recommended for physician use by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

Ninety-six female adolescents participated in this study, published in The Journal of Pediatrics. The Bright Futures questions alone did not predict iron deficiency or anemia. Yet, the researchers' risk assessment questionnaire was equally poor.

Taken together, the studies suggest that risk factors and assessments should not be used to determine which young women should receive testing for iron deficiency.

""The questions aren't predictive,"" Sekhar said. ""I think we need to establish the optimal timing for an objective assessment of adolescent iron deficiency and anemia.""

Sekhar believes the appropriate age may be 16 years old, when most females will have been menstruating for at least three years.

In addition to timing, further research will be needed to determine which blood test for iron deficiency without anemia is accurate, cost-efficient and practical for routine doctor's office use. This test should be given with hemoglobin testing to catch all young women on the spectrum of iron deficiency, Sekhar said.

Iron deficiency can be corrected with dietary changes and supplementation, Sekhar added.

"TAMPA, Fla. (July 17, 2017) - Moffitt Cancer Center researchers launched a first of its kind study comparing the long-term benefits of radiation therapy in women with breast cancer either before surgery (neoadjuvant) or after surgery (adjuvant). Their study, published in the June 30 issue of Breast Cancer Research, found that patients who have neoadjuvant radiation therapy have a significantly lower risk of developing a second primary tumor at any site.

The majority of patients who have early stage breast cancer have surgery to remove their tumor or a complete mastectomy. Surgery is commonly followed by radiation therapy, which has been shown to increase relapse-free survival. However, in some cases, patients may require neoadjuvant radiation therapy to decrease the size of the tumor before surgery. Currently, there are no studies that have analyzed the long-term effects of neoadjuvant radiation therapy on breast cancer patients.

Moffitt researchers compared the overall survival and the time to diagnosis of a second tumor, if any, of 250,195 breast cancer patients who received either neoadjuvant or adjuvant radiation therapy. They analyzed patient outcomes from a National Cancer Institute (NCI) registry database of cancer incidence and survival rates in the United States. They included female patients in the analysis who were diagnosed between 1973 and 2011 with early-stage breast cancer. The analysis included 2,554 women who received localized neoadjuvant breast radiation therapy before surgery and 247,641 women who received localized adjuvant breast radiation therapy after surgery.

The researchers discovered that among the breast cancer patients who tested positive for the estrogen receptor (ER) biomarker, patients who had neoadjuvant radiation therapy had a significantly lower risk of developing a second primary tumor than patients who had adjuvant radiation therapy. This was true for patients who underwent both partial and complete mastectomies. The researchers found that delaying surgery due to neoadjuvant radiation therapy was not a detriment to survival.

A number of recent studies have suggested that radiation therapy may re-educate and stimulate the immune system to target cancer cells. ""The observed benefit of neoadjuvant radiation therapy aligns with the growing body of literature of the immune activation effects of radiation, including shrinking of untreated metastases outside the radiation field,"" explained Heiko Enderling, Ph.D., associate member of Moffitt's Integrated Mathematical Oncology Department.

These data are promising, but randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm the benefit of neoadjuvant radiation therapy. ""Historic data indicate that disease-free survival is significantly increased when radiation therapy is applied before surgery rather than after surgery, especially for ER-positive patients. These findings are worthy of a prospective clinical trial to confirm potential benefits of neoadjuvant vs. adjuvant radiation, and to identify the potential contribution of radiation-induced immunity to vaccinate against future disease,"" said Enderling.

"Patients recovering from knee operations are being helped back to sport and exercise through expert rehabilitation at the University of Kent.

Anti-gravity treadmills get patients running again after knee surgery

Patients recovering from knee operations are being helped back to sport and exercise through expert rehabilitation at the University of Kent.

Using space age technology in the Sports Ready clinic at Medway Park, Gillingham, Dr Karen Hambly, an international expert on knee rehabilitation, works with clients who have been given the all clear to start to return to sporting activities but may have concerns about moving from being a patient with an injury to being an athlete again.

In a report titled Return to running following knee osteochondral repair using an anti-gravity treadmill, published in the journal Physical Therapy in Sport, Dr Hambly demonstrates how a graduated return to running using an anti-gravity treadmill can help to reduce fears about re-injury and increase self-belief in being able to run on the injured knee.

When people run, the load on their knee joints can be up to five times greater than when walking. Healthy cartilage that covers the bone surfaces in the knee joint transfers these high loads from the lower leg to the upper leg. The cartilage covering the bone surface is not able to heal itself when it is damaged and this is why surgical procedures are available to repair the damaged area.

The case report highlights the journey a 39-year-old female endurance runner took from the end of her post-knee surgery rehabilitation to taking part in her sport again. An eight week return to running programme using the anti-gravity treadmill was individually designed by Dr Hambly.

Devices like the anti-gravity treadmill, enable walking or running without the full weight of the body so reducing the load on the joints in the lower limbs and bridging the gap between rehabilitation and return to sport.

The air pressure in the treadmill can be adjusted to take the patient from 100 per cent of their body weight to only 20 per cent, the same feeling as walking on the moon, and reducing the impact and pressure on joints during the run.

Not only does the tailored anti-gravity treadmill programme provide a great environment for healing, it also helps the person restore their belief that they can make a successful return to the sport they love.

The Sports Ready clinic is student-led under supervision of experienced practitioners, with patients self-referring or sent by private clinics and NHS orthopaedic consultants. The team individually tailors rehabilitation programmes to support people in returning to sport and exercise activities after injury or surgery.

A free one day symposium presents Translating Research into Practice on Monday 10 July at the Church Lecture Theatre, Royal Historic Dockyard, Chatham Maritime, ME4 4TE from 9.30am-4.30pm.

"CINCINNATI--Following a concussion or mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), patients may suffer from light sensitivity or photophobia, making it challenging to return to normal activities. The sensitivity may also trigger or exacerbate headaches.

While sunglasses can provide some relief from photophobia, wearing them all the time is not always a practical solution, nor is it pleasant for patients to live in a dark room for days at a time. A new study from the University of Cincinnati (UC), published online this week in the Journal of Athletic Training, assessed the use of colored lenses in post-concussion patients and found wearing certain color-tinted sunglasses may be a good alternative to dark sunglasses.

""While sunglasses can provide some relief, they are not very practical indoors or in low light environments,"" says Joe Clark, PhD, professor in the Department of Neurology and Rehabilitation Medicine at the UC College of Medicine and lead author of the study. ""What is needed is a light mitigation strategy that can be readily employed indoors, which can optimize relief in those who suffer from photophobia, or light sensitivity.""

Clark and researchers at the College of Medicine assessed visual symptoms of 51 concussion patients and used frames with varying colored lenses to find out if certain hues provided relief from photophobia.

""We found that 85 percent of patients reporting photophobia had relief of the symptoms with one or more colors-- blue, green, red and purple--with no reported adverse events,"" Clark says.

""Sensitivity to light can be common and impact activities of daily life suggesting that light mitigation might improve quality of life in many of these patients. Photophobia is a common symptom for patients following traumatic brain injury. Our goal in this study was to provide medical staff like athletic trainers with a method and means to assess and subsequently provide relief to an athlete who may be experiencing symptoms of photophobia,"" Clark adds.

The goal is to help the concussion patient feel better as the brain heals. ""We compare the colored glasses to being like a brace or cast but for the brain,"" he says. ""It is temporary but prevents further injury or pain.""

At least 3.8 million people in the United States sustain a concussion or traumatic brain injury every year, many not for the first time. As with many other health conditions, the presentation of concussion symptoms can vary greatly--while some individuals exhibit very little to no change in functionality and may report no symptoms at all, others may report confusion, headache, decreased balance and vision disturbances including blurry vision, trouble focusing and sensitivity to light.

Photophobia is so common that many neurosurgical intensive care units consider it standard operating procedure to keep lights dimmed in rooms containing TBI patients says Clark.

In addition to trying colored-lens sunglasses, the article suggests other ways to mitigate photophobia including wearing a wide-brimmed hat when outdoors, adjusting digital screen and device settings to an appropriate hue and brightness or purchasing filters for screens. However, the researchers noted, they do not recommend wearing colored glasses while driving. Certain colors make seeing stop lights or emergency vehicle lights difficult.

""We believe that an athletic trainer, in consultation with team physicians, may find it useful to apply this photophobia assessment and recommend colored glasses to his or her athlete,"" Clark says. ""The use of the colored glasses in the high school, college or other setting can allow a person to engage in some medically approved activities, while minimizing the risk of symptom exacerbation. We believe the use of the colored glasses that provide photophobia mitigation has added benefits superior to dark sunglasses, especially for indoor lighting.""

"Amsterdam, July 3, 2017 - Doctors should consider radiosurgery earlier for patients with severe facial pain, according to a new study in the International Journal of Radiation Oncology*Biology*Physics (the ""Red Journal"") - the official journal of the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO).

In the research, radiosurgery helped improve the quality of life for patients with trigeminal neuralgia and reduced their depression, which is often exacerbated by the side effects of other treatments. The authors, from Cleveland Clinic in the US, say considering radiosurgery earlier on could make a big difference to patients' lives.

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a very painful nerve disorder that causes an electrical shock feeling in the face, usually in older people. Some things can trigger it, like chewing or even the wind blowing, but attacks can be random. On a scale of 1-10, patients often describe the pain as 15 - off the scale. TN is commonly treated with anti-epileptic medications. While this can reduce the pain, it makes patients drowsy and tired, and they report feeling drunk. This has an impact on their quality of life and frequently causes depression, as it stops them from driving, working or even just leaving the house.

According to the new study, radiosurgery, which is normally a second line treatment to be used following the medication, helps improve quality of life and reduce depression in patients with TN. By considering it earlier as a treatment option, doctors could help improve the lives of patients with TN more quickly.

""We knew radiosurgery results in pain relief, but we didn't know if the patients actually felt better,"" said Dr. Samuel Chao, corresponding author of the study. ""I think people go and see their neurologist and get the pain under control with medication, but they don't realize how lousy this can make them feel. Using radiosurgery earlier on allows patients to get off the medications, improving their quality of life by allowing them to return to activities they used to do.""

Radiosurgery is a method for physically treating the nerve using radiation - with stereotactic radiosurgery, doctors can focus 192 beams of radiation on a single point. It is non-invasive, so doesn't require the healing time of traditional surgery. Treatment takes less than an hour and requires no anesthetic. However, it is often overlooked or delayed as a treatment because there is a lack of capability and experience with the method. Research has shown that radiosurgery reduces pain for 80% of patients, but the broader impact on their lives remained unknown.

In the new study, Dr. Chao, Dr. Kotecha and his colleagues prospectively collected data from 50 patients they treated with radiosurgery using two questionnaires: EuroQOL 5-Dimension and Patient Health Questionnaire 9. They asked questions about the patients' pain and facial numbness, their health and their ability to take care of themselves. The researchers analyzed patients' answers before treatment and at each follow-up appointment, and found that patients reported an improved quality of life and lower rates of depression after radiosurgery. Importantly, the benefit of treatment was strongly driven by improvements in pain and discomfort as well as self-care.

""Pain and the medication to stop the pain make it difficult for people with TN to go outside and live life,"" explained Dr. Chao. ""With radiosurgery, we can reduce pain, improve quality of life and decrease depression - people can go out and enjoy life without worrying they will have a random attack. Giving options empowers the patient to be more aware of themselves and manage their own condition.""

The team plans to analyze the impact of other treatment options and carry out a cost-based analysis to establish the best treatment options for TN.

"Scientists Edge Closer To Elusive Lab Test For Chronic Fatigue Syndrome

Enlarge this image toggle caption Malte Mueller/Getty Images Malte Mueller/Getty Images

Imagine feeling horribly sick, day after day, yet doctors repeatedly tell you they can't find anything wrong. That typically happens to people with the mysterious illness commonly known as chronic fatigue syndrome. Research findings from Stanford University released Monday could point the way to a long-sought diagnostic laboratory test for the condition, and possibly a first-ever treatment.

Believed to affect at least a million people in the U.S., the condition is now increasingly termed myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME/CFS for short.

Many patients see the name ""chronic fatigue syndrome"" as trivializing and misleading, giving the impression that they're simply tired or depressed. In fact, they're experiencing profound exhaustion that isn't relieved with sleep, flu-like symptoms, muscle pain, ""brain fog"" and various other physical symptoms, all of which characteristically worsen with even minor exertion. (A 2015 Institute of Medicine report proposed the name ""systemic exertion intolerance disease,"" but it hasn't really stuck.)

The symptoms can range from mild to extremely severe, with about a quarter of patients so ill they're mostly or completely confined to bed. Now, the Stanford researchers have linked ME/CFS to variations in certain cytokines, immune-signaling proteins, that track with illness severity. The study results were published online Monday in the the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The link to gradation in severity, rather than simply seeking a positive versus negative result, represents a new approach to the search for biological markers for the illness. The study involved 192 ME/CFS patients and 392 healthy controls matched for age and sex. Out of 51 cytokines investigated via sophisticated fluorescence-based testing, only two of the cytokines differed, in their total concentrations, between the ME/CFS and control groups.

But, levels of 17 of the cytokines varied dramatically between the patients with mild versus severe ME/CFS symptoms. Of those 17 cytokines, 13 were types that promote inflammation. This is significant because symptoms in these patients and findings from other studies also suggest that chronic inflammation plays a major role in the illness.

""This is a field that has been full of skepticism and misconception, where patients have been viewed to have invented their disease. These data clearly show the contrary, and demonstrate what can be achieved when we couple good research design with new technology,"" lead author Dr. Jose Montoya, professor of infectious diseases at Stanford, tells Shots.

According to Dr. Anthony L. Komaroff, a Harvard internist and epidemiologist who has written a commentary to accompany the study, ""For many years medical scientists have speculated that the symptoms of ME/CFS might be caused by cytokines, molecules that the immune system use to wage war against foreign invaders of the body. Past studies have shown high levels of many cytokines but it was not clear that these high levels were causing symptoms.""

What the latest research shows, Komaroff tells Shots, is that ""levels of many cytokines do correlate with symptoms: The higher the blood level, the worse the symptoms. That supports the theory that the cytokines are a cause of the symptoms.""

So why do routine lab tests that doctors order often come back negative or not informative in ME/CFS patients? Simply put, Montoya says, those tests aren't measuring the right things.

Two classic laboratory measures of inflammation are sedimentation rate — the ability of red blood cells to clump together, which isn't a factor in ME/CFS — and C-reactive protein, which reflects levels of a single cytokine that wasn't one of those linked to severity in this study.

""Inflammation is much more complicated than two imperfect old measures,"" Montoya says. ""We're showing an inflammation that has not been seen before.""

The multidisciplinary Stanford team is now working on developing a panel that could be used commercially, that would test for around five of the 17 cytokines and would likely involve the doctor first classifying patients by severity in order to interpret the results. Such a test could both establish the diagnosis and serve to monitor patients' responses to treatment.

What's more, the findings also point to possible treatment with immune-modifying or anti-inflammatory therapy. Montoya hopes that by publishing these findings ""a team of researchers somewhere in the world will see these cytokines and say they have the drug for that inflammation. We hope drug companies will pursue it.""

Indeed, a major drug trial is now being conducted in Norway investigating whether the immune-modifying drug rituximab alleviates ME/CFS symptoms, after preliminary studies suggested that it did in some patients. Interestingly, the drug is approved to treat certain autoimmune diseases and also non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer that one study found uniquely occurs at a higher rate among older people with ME/CFS.

Komaroff also notes a recent increase in research funding by the National Institutes of Health, which has included a comprehensive in-house study aimed at unraveling the underlying causes of the condition.

And in an ongoing privately funded study, Stanford geneticist Ron Davis and a team including three Nobel laureates is taking a similar ""big data"" approach to investigate a group of ME/CFS patients who are all severely ill, including Davis' own adult son.

""There is much to learn,"" Komaroff writes, in the journal. ""Hopefully, a decade from now, ""doctors will know better what to measure and, more importantly, what to do to ease the suffering caused by this illness.""

HealthDay Reporter

WEDNESDAY, Aug. 2, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- A new treatment might open the door for more patients with advanced kidney disease to get a transplant, a preliminary study suggests.

Of the 100,000-plus Americans waiting for a donor kidney, about one-third are ""sensitized,"" said Dr. Robert Montgomery, director of the Transplant Institute at NYU Langone in New York City.

Those patients face a tough situation: They harbor immune system antibodies that are primed to attack a donor organ.

The antibodies can form when a person is exposed to foreign tissue, Montgomery explained. So a patient who's had a prior kidney transplant may be highly sensitized -- meaning they have a large number of the offending antibodies.

It can also happen to patients who've had blood transfusion or ever been pregnant, Montgomery said.

It's almost impossible to find a compatible donor for those patients. But they might be able to receive a kidney from an incompatible donor if they first undergo an extensive ""desensitization"" process.

That involves various treatments -- including IV drugs called immune globulin and rituximab -- that try to quash the antibodies that would attack the donor organ.

Now the new research suggests a simple approach -- an infusion of a particular enzyme hours before the transplant -- could offer a better alternative.

Researchers found that the treatment -- dubbed IdeS -- quickly wiped out the dangerous antibodies, allowing all but one of 25 patients to have a successful transplant.

The findings were published in the Aug. 2 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. Funding for the study came from the company developing IdeS -- Hansa Medical.

Montgomery, who was not involved in the study, said he's ""never seen anything like it.""

""When you give this, all of the antibodies are gone,"" Montgomery said. ""I'm hopeful that this will turn out to be a game-changer.""

However, he stressed, many questions remain.

Critically, the enzyme does not banish the antibodies forever. They come back, Montgomery said -- and the results of that comeback vary from patient to patient.

In the study, 10 patients had an episode of antibody-mediated rejection anywhere from two weeks to five months after their transplant. That means antibodies started to attack the new kidney.

Those patients were all successfully treated with standard anti-rejection drugs, according to the researchers.

Still, it's not yet clear how the patients will fare in the long term, said Dr. Julie Ingelfinger, a professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston.

Ingelfinger, who wrote an editorial published with the study, echoed Montgomery's cautious optimism.

If larger, longer studies bolster the current findings, she said, ""this could potentially be practice-changing.""

""But,"" Ingelfinger stressed, ""only time will tell.""

Lead researcher Dr. Stanley Jordan agreed that more work is necessary.

But the findings mark another step forward for patients like these, according to Jordan, who is medical director of the kidney transplant program at Cedars-Sinai, in Los Angeles.

Traditionally, highly sensitized patients in need of a kidney have languished on waiting lists because it's so hard to find a compatible donor.

But in the past 15 years or so, desensitization has emerged as an alternative.

Last year, a landmark study proved that patients who receive transplants after desensitization live significantly longer than those who stay on dialysis.

""The outcomes have been good,"" Jordan said.

But, he added, there's clearly room for improvement.

Ingelfinger agreed. ""The desensitization protocols now in use are time-consuming, and they don't always work,"" she said, noting that they can leave dangerous antibodies behind.

Desensitization adds about $20,000 to $30,000 to the cost of the transplant, according to the University of Wisconsin's transplant center.

The new approach is quite different, Ingelfinger said.

Patients receive one infusion of an enzyme called IdeS four to six hours before the transplant.

The enzyme is derived from a strain of Streptococcus bacteria, and it essentially chops up the antibodies that would attack the organ.

Jordan acknowledged that the source ""sounds scary,"" but stressed that patients do not receive the bacteria itself -- but an engineered version of the enzyme.

In all, 25 U.S. and Swedish patients received an infusion of IdeS before their kidney transplant. All but one had a successful transplant, and none had detectable antibodies immediately afterward.

IdeS patients still received additional treatment -- including a week of immune globulin and rituximab infusions.

And as with all transplants, they needed standard anti-rejection drugs.

Because IdeS so readily banishes the offending antibodies, it might make transplants feasible for even the most highly sensitized patients, Montgomery said.

But the ""$65,000 question"" remains, he said: Can it extend the survival of the donor kidney and, ultimately, patients' lives?

IdeS is still experimental, and the only way patients could receive it is through a clinical trial. It will be ""a few years"" before it could be more widely available, Montgomery said.

The hitch: Top reproductive endocrinologists point out that there’s no evidence the $950 DNA test can actually help women conceive. And even the company’s founder and CEO acknowledges the test can’t provide clear and definitive answers on which treatments women should try next if they’re struggling with infertility.

The Fertilome test hit the market at the start of this year and the company behind it, Celmatix, said more than 50 doctors have already ordered it for hundreds of women seeking scientific guidance on questions such as whether they should freeze their eggs for future use, or whether it’s worth it to try another round of in vitro fertilization. The Celmatix CEO, Piraye Yurttas Beim, said her team has heard of a small wave of “Fertilome babies” on the way.

Some reproductive specialists are enthusiastic. But others caution that Fertilome is just the latest genetic test promising more than it can deliver — and, in this case, playing to the fears of women who are anxious about becoming a mother. (Another example: a new $89 test that claims to tell women how their DNA could influence the level of a beneficial fatty acid in their breast milk.)

The Fertilome test, which must be ordered by a doctor, analyzes a woman’s DNA for 49 genetic variants that have been linked to various conditions that can sometimes cause fertility problems. A couple weeks later, the doctor gets back a long report listing the odds that a patient has certain conditions.

For example, she might be 4.4 times more likely than women without a particular genetic variant to have a condition known as primary ovarian insufficiency, characterized by irregular periods and diminished fertility before age 40.

That sounds alarming, and might prompt a younger woman who’s planning to delay pregnancy to freeze her eggs to be sure she has them available down the road. But the report does not explain that the condition is fairly rare — affecting just 1 in 1,000 women by age 30 and 1 in 250 women by age 35 — so the absolute risk is still very small.

The $950 Fertilome test must be ordered by a doctor and requires women to get their blood drawn. Celmatix

And just because women have an elevated genetic risk for a condition doesn’t mean they actually have it.

Many of the other conditions that the test screens for are also quite rare. But the report doesn’t explain the prevalence.

So a patient may see a table showing that her genetic variants make her twice as likely to have a condition known as recurrent pregnancy loss, defined as repeated miscarriages. But the report doesn’t note that just 1 percent of women have that condition in the first place, making the odds still overwhelmingly in her favor. The doctor ordering the test, or a genetic counselor, is supposed to provide that information.

Without the proper context, “some of this can be very misleading and very frightening to patients,” said Dr. John Petrozza, chief of the division of reproductive medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital.

Petrozza said he worries that women might wrongly interpret a long litany of genetic risks to mean that their hopes to start a family are “doomed.” He also said he sees the test as “very costly for what it’s trying to do — and not really giving, at least at this point, what I would consider meaningful information.”

Tapping into women’s anxieties

The Fertilome test was eight years in the making. It draws on more than 5,000 studies that have found associations between particular genetic variants and conditions that can cause fertility problems, company spokeswoman Colleen McMillen said.

Beim, the Celmatix CEO, said the test is already bringing “tremendous” value, in part by providing guidance that can act as a “tiebreaker” to help patients and their doctor decide which treatment to prioritize.

“It will help save a lot of heartache and time if we could know from the very beginning that [a given patient] is at risk for a uterine factor, or if it’s more her eggs,” said Dr. Angie Beltsos, a reproductive endocrinologist in private practice in Chicago who ordered the Fertilome test for one of her patients for the first time last month.

What the test can’t do: provide evidence-backed answers on what patients should try next. Nor can it tell patients whether they’re wired to get pregnant from IVF — or wired to fail it. “We’re not there. We’re not claiming we’re there,” Beim said.

Beim trained as a molecular genetics researcher. As a Ph.D. student at Weill Cornell in the 2000s, she worked on an early project in what’s now called precision medicine: identifying the specific genetic alterations in the tumors of lung cancer patients that seemed to predict whether they would respond to a certain drug.

After shifting her research focus to embryology, Beim found herself frustrated that the fertility field wasn’t benefiting from the same boom in translational genetics that was reshaping oncology. So she started her own company.

Celmatix also sells software, called Polaris, that pulls from the medical histories of hundreds of thousands of women to try to predict which fertility treatments are likely to work in different circumstances.

“Some of this can be very misleading and very frightening to patients.” Dr. John Petrozza, fertility specialist

Fertilome — not to be confused with a line of weed killers and other gardening products with the same name — launched in January with a $1,900 price tag. Insurers don’t cover it; after it became clear that patients were balking at the bill, Celmatix cut the price in half.

Celmatix is mostly marketing the test to reproductive specialists, who are largely using it in the toughest infertility cases, Beim said.

But the company is also beginning to market directly to women — including younger women who aren’t trying to get pregnant yet.

The company has recently started promoting social media ads, like one that asks: “Are you getting the right fertility treatments for your DNA?” Another asserts: “Over 60% of millennial women are open to #eggfreezing. The Fertilome test can help you decide if it is right for you.”

The company’s website also features testimonials from women who say they have used Fertilome to help guide their decisions. There’s Ella, a 30-year-old with dark hair and stylish clothing who decided to freeze her eggs after taking the Fertilome test. Then there’s Maxine, a 27-year-old medical school graduate with short hair and a warm smile who used the test to help her juggle the timing of starting a family and starting her career.

The wrinkle: The images of Ella and Maxine are actually stock photos, available for purchase online.

After questions from STAT, the company added a disclaimer acknowledging that testimonials are not quite as they were promoted from the start: the names, images, and details of patients’ stories have been changed to safeguard their privacy.

Along with its social media outreach, Celmatix has held several after-work events for New York City-area women. It hosted one, on a Wednesday night in April, in its offices on Wall Street.

An ad beckons women to a seminar to learn about “proactive steps you can take today to reach your future family building goals.”

And on a Tuesday evening earlier this summer, the company partnered with a women’s group to host a conversation about “proactive steps you can take today to reach your future family building goals.” Appetizers, wine, and beer were served — and, in a gesture to the crowd full of women with pregnancy on their minds, non-alcoholic beverages were on the menu, too.

The company is also trying to reach OB-GYNs whose patients aren’t yet trying to get pregnant — or may be just beginning to try. Celmatix held webinars earlier this summer for OB-GYNs, telling them that the test could help “optimize management plans from the very start.”

DNA analysis points a patient to Walmart for supplements

Dr. Aimee Eyvazzadeh, a reproductive endocrinologist in private practice in the Bay Area, is among a few doctors who’ve been given vouchers by the company to offer the test for $500. She’s been ordering the Fertilome test for her patients about five times a week.

Eyvazzadeh said the test recently helped her counsel a patient to forgo a third round of IVF, because the patient had a genetic profile that suggested it would be unlikely to work and wasn’t in a financial position to gamble on such slim odds. (A round of IVF can cost $13,000.) That patient is now considering an egg donor.

Another one of Eyvazzadeh’s patients is 31-year-old Tara Smith.

For Smith, who works as a foster parent providing intensive care in Northern California, there’s nothing more important than family. She’s dreamed of having her own baby since she was a child herself.

That’s why Smith and her husband have spent about $70,000 over the past four years trying, without success, to get pregnant. They’ve seen doctors in St. Louis and Las Vegas, taken countless blood tests, and tried two rounds of IVF and several cycles of intrauterine insemination. Smith has long known that she has a condition called polycystic ovary syndrome, which can make it harder to get pregnant, but no one could figure out exactly why none of the treatments were working.

“It’s gut-wrenching. You’re almost like this alien,” Smith said. “Nobody knows what’s going on, and you can’t fix the problem.”

So when Eyvazzadeh suggested that she take the Fertilome test, Smith jumped at the possibility of finally getting answers. Eyvazzadeh walked her through the results last month before showing her the report, so Smith had an idea of what to expect. Still, Smith said, “my heart sank” when she saw her results for the first time.

She was 2.88 times more likely to have endometriosis, a painful disorder of the uterus, than a woman without a certain genetic variant. She was 1.54 times more likely to have primary ovarian insufficiency. She also carried three genetic variants that elevated her risk of having recurrent pregnancy loss. And she had 24 additional genetic variants that are more weakly associated with various conditions that can play a role in fertility problems.

“It’s gut-wrenching. You’re almost like this alien. Nobody knows what’s going on, and you can’t fix the problem.” Tara Smith, fertility patient

Despite it all, Eyvazzadeh had a plan. Because many of Smith’s genetic variants were involved in immune response regulation, she instructed Smith to focus on minimizing inflammation.

At Eyvazzadeh’s recommendation, Smith spent about $200 buying dietary supplements like fish oils, turmeric, cayenne pepper, resveratrol, and berberine from Amazon and Walmart. Smith also embarked on a new diet, cutting out dairy and red meat. (A 2015 review of the evidence on the optimal diet to promote fertility — and the utility of supplements — found the data “conflicting.”)

They also plan to have Smith get infusions of intralipids — a cocktail of soy bean oil, egg yolks, and other fatty acids — during her third round of IVF, which she’s embarking on now. (Intralipid infusions are increasingly popular, but the practice was found not to help in a 2016 study of older women with a history of miscarriage.)

Smith has mostly positive feelings about her Fertilome test. Having a concrete plan based on what’s in her DNA gives her a new sense of hope. “Now I feel like we’re armed with information,” she said. But at the same time, she said, knowing what may be wrong with her makes her apprehensive about whether she’ll ever get pregnant.

After all, so far, the test has pointed her only to try nutritional tweaks of uncertain value. It doesn’t offer any definitive answers.

And that’s what gives Dr. Valerie Baker pause. A reproductive endocrinologist at Stanford, she recently suggested the test to a patient with longstanding infertility. The patient asked a good question: What would we do differently if we had this genetic analysis?

“I don’t know,” Baker recalled responding. “I probably wouldn’t do anything differently.”

She did not end up ordering the test."	Can a genetic test really boost your odds of becoming pregnant?	2017-08-02 06:00:00	https://www.statnews.com/2017/08/02/infertility-genetic-test-fertilome/	story_reviews_00192	true
"Flattening The 'Mummy Tummy' With 1 Exercise, 10 Minutes A Day

Enlarge this image toggle caption Talia Herman for NPR Talia Herman for NPR

I admit it. I have a ""mummy tummy,"" also known as ""mommy pooch."" You know, that soft jelly belly you retain after having a baby — it makes you look a few months pregnant.

I've tried to convince myself that the pooch is a valiant badge of motherhood, but who am I kidding? The pooch bothers me. And it turns out it has been causing back pain.

So when I hear that a fitness coach and doctor have come up with a technique that can flatten the pooch quickly and easily, I think, ""Why not?""

A few weeks later, I'm rolling out a yoga mat with a dozen other moms and pregnant women in San Francisco.

""We will see a dramatic change,"" says Leah Keller, who leads the class.

""You can easily expect to see 2 inches off your waist in three weeks of time,"" Keller says. ""That's not an unrealistic expectation.""

We had patients that were even one year out from giving birth, and they still had such great benefit from the exercises.""

Decked out in purple yoga pants and leather cowboy boots, Keller is a personal trainer from New York City. She has developed an exercise that allegedly shrinks the mommy pooch.

There is science to back up the method, she says.

""A doctor at Weill Cornell and I did a study on the exact same program we're going to do,"" Keller says. ""And we found 100 percent of women achieved full resolution.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Talia Herman for NPR Talia Herman for NPR

OK! Wait a second. Two inches off my belly in three weeks? That sounds too good to be true. I decide to do a little digging into the science of mummy tummy and Keller's claim.

Putting the six-pack back together

It turns out the jelly belly actually has a medical name: diastasis recti, which refers to a separation of the abdominal muscles.

And it's quite common. Last year, a study from Norway reported about a third of moms end up with diastasis recti a year after giving birth.

""This is such a ubiquitous issue,"" says Dr. Geeta Sharma, an OB-GYN at Weill Cornell Medical Center-New York Presbyterian Hospital.

And it's not just a cosmetic problem. Diastasis recti can cause another problem for new moms: lower back pain.

""People can start feeling some back pain because the core is weakened,"" Sharma says.

The Diastasis Recti During pregnancy, the abdominal muscles responsible for a ""six pack"" stretch apart (left) to accommodate a growing fetus. After birth, the muscles don't always bounce back, leaving a gap known as the mommy pooch.

How To Test For Diastasis Recti There's a simple way to see whether you have diastasis recti: Lie flat on your back with your knees bent. Put your fingers right above your belly button and press down gently. Then lift up your head about an inch while keeping your shoulders on the ground. If you have diastasis recti, you will feel a gap between the muscles that is wider than an inch.

In rare occasions, the tissue in the abdomen isn't just stretched, but it is also torn a bit. This can cause a hernia, Sharma says.

""If there's a defect in a layer of tissue called the linea alba, then the bowel can poke through,"" Sharma says. ""That's going to be more dangerous.""

A hernia may require surgery. ""So I will refer patients to a general surgeon to have a CT scan if there's really a true concern about a hernia,"" Sharma says.

Diastasis recti arises during pregnancy because the growing fetus pushes the abdominal muscles apart — specifically the rectus abdominal muscles.

""These are the muscles that give you a 'six pack,' "" says Dr. Linda Brubaker, an OB-GYN at the University of California, San Diego. ""People think these muscles go horizontal across the belly. But they actually go vertical from head to toe.""

The rectus abdominal muscles should be right next to each other, on either side of the belly button, Brubaker says. ""There shouldn't be much of gap between them.""

But during pregnancy, a gap opens up between the muscles, right around the belly button. Sometimes that gap closes on its own, but other times, it stays open.

That leaves a spot in the belly where there is very little muscle to hold in your stomach and other organs, a spot that can be 1 to 2 inches wide. That lets the organs and overlying tissue bulge out — and cause mommy pooch.

To flatten the area, women have to get those abdominal muscles to realign. And that is where the exercises come into play.

If you search online for ways to fix diastasis recti, you'll turn up a deluge of exercise routines, all claiming to help coax the abdominal muscles back together.

But the quality of much of that information isn't good, Brubaker says. ""Some of it is actually potentially harmful.""

Even some exercises aimed at strengthening the abdomen can exacerbate diastasis recti, says Keller, including simple crunches.

""You have to be very careful,"" she says. ""For example, please don't ever again in your life do crossover crunches or bicycle crunches. They splay your abs apart in so many ways.""

That said, there are a few exercise programs for diastasis recti that many doctors and physical therapists support. These include the Tupler Technique, Keller's Dia Method and the MuTu System in the U.K.

Most such courses, taught once a week for an hour in New York, San Francisco and at least a few other places, tend to run about four to 12 weeks and cost around $100 to $300. Some places offer online classes and videos, which are much less expensive.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also recommends abdominal exercises for the perinatal period. But the organization's guidelines don't provide details — such as which exercises work best or how often women should do them and for how long.

Plus, ACOG focuses more on preventing diastasis than on fixing the problem; it recommends strengthening the abdomen before and during pregnancy.

toggle caption Talia Herman for NPR

""The best way is prevention,"" says Dr. Raul Artal, an OB-GYN at St. Louis University, who helped ACOG write its exercise guidelines for the perinatal period. ""The best way to do that is to exercise during pregnancy.""

But, as Sharma, the Cornell OB-GYN, points out, no one has really vigorously studied these various exercises to see whether they actually fix diastasis recti.

""There's a general knowledge that exercise is going to help,"" Sharma says. ""But no one has really tested them in a standardized way.""

In fact, the few studies that have been done haven't been high enough quality to draw conclusions, researchers in Australia said a few years ago.

Sharma hopes to change that. A few years ago, she teamed up with Keller to start to gather some evidence on her technique.

""We did a pilot study to see if the method is helpful for women,"" Sharma says.

The study was small — just 63 women. But the results were quite promising. After 12 weeks of doing Keller's exercise — 10 minutes a day — all the women had fixed their diastasis recti, Sharma and Keller reported at ACOG's annual meeting few years ago.

""We had patients that were even one year out from giving birth, and they still had such great benefit from the exercises,"" Sharma says. ""We love to see that there is something we can do to help women.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Talia Herman for NPR Talia Herman for NPR

Now Sharma says she is working to put together a larger study to really nail down when the exercise works and how well.

Tight and tighter

Back at the class in San Francisco, Keller is taking us moms through the key exercise. It's surprisingly simple to do.

""The exercise is a very small, very intense movement that's almost imperceptible,"" Keller says. ""OK. We're going to do another set.""

Sitting on the floor cross-legged, with our hands on our bellies, we all take a big breath. ""Let the belly fully expand,"" Keller says.

And then as we exhale, we suck in our belly muscles — as far back as they'll go, toward the spine. ""Now we're going to stay here near the spine. Hold this position,"" she says.

Then we take tiny breaths. With each exhale, we push our stomachs back further and further.

""Tight, tighter,"" Keller chants, rhythmically.

You can do the exercise in several different positions, Keller says: sitting crossed-legged, sitting on your knees, standing with knees slightly bent, on all fours or laying on your side in the fetal position.

The key is to be sure your back is flat, and that you do the exercise 10 minutes each day, changing positions every two minutes or so. For the rest of the time, your belly is pulled all the way back into the spine.

""The fingertips on the bellybutton are really important for this reason,"" she says. ""So you know that you're squeezing tight, tighter with the belly, and you're never bulging the bellybutton forward.""

This is our fourth week of class, and we've been doing this same exercise on our own every day for at least 10 minutes. So it's judgment day. Time to see whether we've flattened our bellies and resolved the diastasis recti.

Keller pulls out a measuring tape and starts wrapping it around women's middles. She also has us lie down on the floor, so she can measure the separation in our abdominal muscles.

One by one, there is success after success. Several moms completely closed up their abdominal separations. Many lost inches from their bellies.

One woman had amazing results. ""Oh my goodness, you lost nearly four inches from your belly circumference,"" Keller exclaims. ""That's amazing!""

How did I fare? Well, after three weeks, I didn't completely close up the abdominal separation. My separation decreased from 1.2 inches to 0.8 inches.* But I did drop more than an inch from my belly circumference.

And I am quite happy with the results. My abs are definitely firmer. And regularly doing this exercise brought a bonus benefit: My lower back pain has almost completely gone away.

*I continued to do the exercises after the class had finished. I checked with in Keller three weeks later to have her measure my diastasis recti. At that point, the separation had dropped down to 0.6 inches, which meant technically I no longer have diastasis recti."

"It is the first new drug for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 22 years to become available in the United States. Called edaravone – brand name Radicava – its FDA approval this week was met with a wave of excitement from the media and the ALS community.

But some physicians are raising concerns over the cost of the drug and whether or not patients will be able to get it, as well as noting misconceptions about how effective at fighting this degenerative condition this drug will actually be.

Each year, doctors diagnose anywhere between 5,000 to 6,000 Americans with this rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease, and the Centers for Disease Control estimates that 12,000 to 15,000 people at any given time in the U.S. live with the disease. The majority of these patients die within two to five years of diagnosis.

The FDA approval is based on a study of 137 people with ALS published earlier this year. Patients received either a placebo pill or edaravone over a six-month period. Researchers found that those getting edaravone had a 33 percent reduction in their rate of decline in physical function.

It’s a finding that inspires hope of slowing -- but not yet stopping or reversing -- the progression of this disease.

Dr. Leo McCluskey, who leads the University of Pennsylvania’s ALS Center and was not involved in the study nor in the approval of this drug, said the findings are promising but he added that he fears they could be misinterpreted.

“Thirty percent is pretty robust,” McCluskey said. But he nonetheless added, “We have patients calling our center asking for the cure to ALS, and this is not a cure.”

And then there is the price tag. According to MT Pharma America, the company behind Radicava, the cost is around $1,000 per infusion – and treatment, which involves multiple infusions, may total about $146,000 per year.

“This is just for the drug; you also need a nurse and infusion equipment,” McCluskey said. “We don’t know who is going to cover it or what criteria will be used to decide who gets it.”

McCluskey also expressed concerns about the feasibility of ALS patients with reduced mobility going to receive daily infusions. “Imagine you’re a patient with difficulty moving around, and you now have to come in every day to receive infusions.”

And the number of infusions needed means many such trips. Edaravone is administered by an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes in 28-day cycles. The initial cycle involves a daily infusion for two weeks, followed by a two-week period without infusions. Additional cycles consist of infusions for 10 days over two weeks followed by two-week drug-free periods.

In an interview with ABC News, Tom Larson, the chief commercial officer for MT Pharma America, said the company is already taking steps to streamline the process for obtaining Radicava. The company has set up a system called Searchlight, through which patients and physicians can apply for the drug, obtain benefits information, identify an infusion center and schedule an infusion. Larson said the company has partnered with over 1,100 infusion centers across the country in an effort to “make this as easy and accessible to patients as possible.”

As for the costs and coverage of the drug, Larson said insurance companies are still deciding whether they will pay for Radicava. “We are in the process every new pharmaceutical goes through as payers make a decision.”

"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said it had approved Adamas Pharmaceuticals Inc’s treatment for a side effect caused by a commonly prescribed Parkinson’s drug, sending the shares of the drugmaker soaring in after-market trading.

The company’s shares were up 30.9 percent at $18.84 after the bell on Thursday.

A majority of patients diagnosed with Parkinson’s are treated with levodopa, whose use often leads to dyskinesia - involuntary movements that are non-rhythmic, purposeless and unpredictable.

Parkinson’s disease is a debilitating disorder in which brain cells progressively die causing patients to experience tremors, rigidity, extreme slowness of movement, impaired balance, and difficulties in swallowing and speaking.

Adamas’ Gocovri, previously ADS-5102, is the first drug cleared by the FDA to control levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). The long-acting therapy is taken once-daily at bedtime.

An estimated 90 percent of levodopa-treated patients, about 200,000 people in the United States, suffer from LID, the company said.

Fluctuating levels of levodopa result in erratic periods of muscular control and involuntary movements throughout the day, disrupting activity at least half a dozen times a day.

As Parkinson’s progresses, patients are dyskinetic just after taking levodopa but increasingly exhibit “off time”, or worsening symptoms, as it wears off.

These patients have little recourse, other than opting for deep brain stimulation, a surgical procedure that involves blocking electrical signals from targeted areas in the brain.

With Gocovri, which targets both dyskinesia and off time, patients will be able to reclaim about 3.6 hours of their day, CEO Gregory Went said in an interview ahead of the decision.

About 50,000 people are diagnosed with Parkinson’s in the United States each year, according to the National Institutes of Health.

The main ingredient of Gocovri, amantadine, has been available in the market as an antiviral drug for several decades.

The company said the drug is expected to be available in the fourth quarter, and formally launched in January 2018.

"Jonathan Lubecky, a Marine Corps and Army veteran, returned from a deployment to Iraq with severe PTSD. His participation in a study of MDMA, the drug commonly known as ecstasy, proved life-saving. (Travis Dove/For The Washington Post)

For Jon Lubecky, the scars on his wrists are a reminder of the years he spent in mental purgatory.

He returned from an Army deployment in Iraq a broken man. He heard mortar shells and helicopters where there were none. He couldn’t sleep and drank until he passed out. He got every treatment offered by Veterans Affairs for post-traumatic stress disorder. But they didn’t stop him from trying to kill himself — five times.

Finally, he signed up for an experimental therapy and was given a little green capsule. The anguish stopped.

Inside that pill was the compound MDMA, better known by dealers and partygoers as ecstasy. That street drug is emerging as the most promising tool in years for the military’s escalating PTSD epidemic.

The MDMA program was created by a small group of psychedelic researchers who had toiled for years in the face of ridicule, funding shortages and skepticism. But the results have been so positive that this month the Food and Drug Administration deemed it a “breakthrough therapy” — setting it on a fast track for review and potential approval.

The prospect of a government-sanctioned psychedelic drug has generated both excitement and concern. And it has opened the door to scientists studying new uses for other illegal psychedelics like LSD and psilocybin (commonly known as magic mushrooms).

“We’re in this odd situation where one of the most promising therapies also happens to be a Schedule 1 substance banned by the [Drug Enforcement Administration],” said retired Brig. Gen. Loree Sutton, who until 2010 was the highest-ranking psychiatrist in the U.S. Army.

Because of the stigma attached to psychedelics since the trippy 1960s, many military and government leaders still hesitate to embrace them. Some scientists are also wary of the nonprofit spearheading ecstasy therapy, a group with the stated goal of making the banned drugs part of mainstream culture.

But the scope and severity of PTSD makes it all irrelevant, said Sutton, who now works as New York City’s commissioner of veteran services. “If this is something that could really save lives, we need to run and not walk toward it. We need to follow the data.”

PTSD has been a problem for the military for decades, but America’s recent wars have pushed it to epidemic-level heights. Experts estimate that between 11 and 20 percent of soldiers who served in Iraq or Afghanistan suffer from PTSD.

The affliction is typically triggered after experiencing or witnessing violence, including assault and abuse. It has ravaged lives and broken up marriages. It often leaves its victims in sudden panic and prevents them from dealing with the original trauma.

And that last symptom is what makes PTSD particularly hard to overcome with traditional talk therapy. Because patients can’t talk about and process the trauma, experts say, it lingers like a poison in their mind.

Only two drugs are approved for treating PTSD: Zoloft and Paxil. Both have proved largely ineffective when it comes to veterans, whose cases are especially difficult to resolve because of their prolonged or repeated exposure to combat.

“If you’re a combat veteran with multiple tours of duty, the chance of a good response to these drugs is 1 in 3, maybe lower,” said John Krystal, chairman of psychiatry at Yale University and a director at the VA’s National Center for PTSD. “That’s why there’s so much frustration and interest in finding something that works better.”

Ecstasy has long been a favorite at trance parties and raves because of its unique ability to flood users with intense feelings of euphoria. But as a byproduct, it also reduces fear and imbues users with a deep sense of love and acceptance of themselves and others — the perfect conditions for trauma therapy.

By giving doses of MDMA at the beginning of three, eight-hour therapy sessions, researchers say they have helped chronic PTSD patients process and move past their traumas.

In clinical trials with 107 patients closely monitored by the FDA, 61 percent reported major reductions in symptoms — to the point where they no longer fit the criteria for PTSD. Follow-up studies a year later found 67 percent no longer had PTSD.

“If you were to design the perfect drug to treat PTSD, MDMA would be it,” said Rick Doblin, who three decades ago founded the California nonprofit behind the clinical trials.

It is no accident that the group — the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) — chose PTSD as its argument for ending the government’s ban on psychedelics.

“We wanted to help a population that would automatically win public sympathy,” he said. “No one’s going to argue against the need to help them.”

Doblin, now 63, talks openly about his own history with drugs. He began tripping on LSD as a rebellious, long-haired college freshman in the 1970s. He says it helped him see the world and himself in new ways. He wanted to become a therapist and use psychedelics to help others achieve similar insights, but he couldn’t because LSD was already banned.

“The flaw of the early psychedelic movement was that they made it countercultural, a revolution,” he said. “Culture is dominant. Culture is always going to win.”

For a decade, he worked in construction until he came across MDMA for the first time. When the DEA moved to criminalize it in 1984, Doblin created MAPS and sued the agency. The lawsuit failed, and Doblin realized that psychedelics were perceived as too fringe to win public support.

To succeed, he decided, both he and the issue had to go mainstream.

Doblin talked his way into the public policy PhD program at Harvard University and learned to navigate the federal bureaucracy. He shaved off his mustache, cut his shaggy hair and learned to dress up.

“I used to laugh about how simple it was,” he said. “You put on a suit, and suddenly everyone thinks you’re fine.”

The external switch reflected an internal one as well. Instead of fighting government officials, he began plotting to win them over, especially those at the FDA.

And the key, he realized, was science.

Before the FDA would even talk about clinical trials for MDMA, the agency needed proof it wasn’t dangerous. Previous studies suggesting its neurotoxicity had been limited to rats. So in 1986, Doblin scraped together money to buy monkeys for those same researchers, who found the risks to be much less at human-equivalent doses than previously thought.

The next step was investigating MDMA’s effects on people. Doblin again raised money to fly psychedelic users he had befriended to Stanford University and Johns Hopkins University for spinal taps. The studies were approved by review boards at both institutions. Doblin also participated, undergoing two spinal taps.

In the two decades that followed, Doblin and MAPS inched toward progress.

The nonprofit grew from a one-man band to a staff of 25 with headquarters in Santa Cruz. It tapped into the scene in Silicon Valley — where many tech entrepreneurs have used psychedelics to spark creativity. (Steve Jobs famously praised LSD as “one of the two or three most important things I have done in my life.”)

MAPS received a $5.5 million bequest from the founder of a software company. The hipster soap company Dr. Bronner’s pledged $5 million. A professional poker player who attributed his wins to microdosing on LSD gave $25,000. Recently, an anonymous $21,000 bitcoin donation came in.

Much of that money funded small-scale clinical trials, which laid the groundwork for the last remaining hurdle: Large-scale “phase 3” trials that will begin next year, involving 200 to 300 patients in 14 locations.

If those future trials yield similar results, the FDA could approve the MDMA treatment for PTSD as soon as 2021, according to Doblin.

Yet his dream extends beyond that. He envisions a future where psychedelic treatment centers are in every city — places people can visit for enhanced couples therapy, spiritual experiences and personal growth. He believes psychedelics can help address the country’s biggest problems, including homelessness, war and global warming.

“These drugs are a tool that can make people more compassionate, tolerant, more connected with other humans and the planet itself,” he said.

That kind of talk makes many in the medical community nervous.

It’s hard to measure the exact dangers of ecstasy. Because it is not used as widely as marijuana or cocaine, for example, fewer statistics are available on overdoses or injuries. In 2011, a public health monitoring system identified 22,498 emergency department visits nationwide related to ecstasy.

MDMA researchers point out that one key difference between MDMA and street ecstasy (along with another variant called “molly”) is the street versions often contain other harmful drugs, experts say. Sometimes the pills don’t even contain MDMA.

But even in its purest clinical form, MDMA can pose risks. At high doses, it can cause the body to overheat. It can cause anxiety and increase the stress hormone cortisol. Chronic use can also cause memory impairment.

“I think it’s a dangerous substance,” said Andrew Parrott, a psychology professor at Swansea University in Wales who spent years researching the drug’s harmful effects. He worries that FDA approval for the treatment of PTSD could lead many in the public to believe ecstasy is safe for recreational use.

Other experts, however, have become increasingly intrigued by its promising results.

“Anytime you have an organization that is advocating for drugs that are illegal, it marginalizes them in the research field. MAPS still isn’t seen as mainstream. But it’s possible they have a point here,” said Krystal, the Yale psychiatrist, who has not been involved with the group’s research. “I can’t think of a single medication that doesn’t carry some side effect. The question here is whether the benefits outweigh the risk.”

For Lubecky, the drug can’t be approved fast enough.

The Marine Corps and Army veteran recalls coming home from Iraq in 2006 to discover his wife had left him, sold his motorcycle and taken his dog. That, coupled with the trauma of what he had seen at war, sent him over the edge.

On Christmas Eve, he put the muzzle of his Beretta to his temple and pulled the trigger. The gun malfunctioned, he said, “but that microsecond after the hammer fell is when I finally felt at peace because I knew the pain would finally be over.”

One incident in Iraq in particular tormented him — a shot he took while protecting his unit. “It was a situation where the right thing to do was the immoral thing,” he said, declining to describe it in detail. “You’re looking through a scope at another human being, and you do one thing and suddenly they don’t exist anymore.”

For years he told no one about it. He would panic even thinking about it.

After he was accepted into the MDMA clinical trial in South Carolina, he found himself on a futon with two counselors on either side as the effects of the drug sank in.

“I was in such a comfortable place,” recalled Lubecky, 40, who now works in Charleston as a political consultant. “I didn’t even realize I was finally talking about it, admitting it for the first time to anybody.”

Since then, he said, he has learned to accept what happened in Iraq. And the guilt he now struggles with is the fact he got chosen over others for the clinical trial.

“I was the 26th veteran chosen for a 26-person study,” he said. “I have friends who are suffering every day like I was. But they can’t do it because it’s illegal. This could save their lives.”

"ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis will seek regulatory approval this year for a new kind of anti-inflammatory heart drug, though some experts fear fatal infection risks and a high price may overshadow the medicine’s limited benefits.

Keenly awaited clinical trial results released on Sunday showed heart-attack survivors on one of three doses of canakinumab were 15 percent less likely to suffer another major cardiac event than those on a placebo.

Novartis had said in June that the drug met its goal in the study but details were only unveiled at European Society of Cardiology meeting in Barcelona. One leading expert described the benefit as “modest”.

Patients getting canakinumab also suffered significantly more deaths from infections than those on placebo - but, on the positive side, they appeared to be at lower risk of cancer.

There was no significant difference in the rate of deaths from all causes between the placebo group and those on canakinumab.

“The modest absolute clinical benefit of canakinumab cannot justify its routine use in patients with previous myocardial infarction until we understand more about the efficacy and safety trade-offs and unless a price restructuring and formal cost-effectiveness evaluation supports it,” wrote Dr. Robert Harrington, chair of the Stanford University School of Medicine, in an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Canakinumab had stirred considerable scientific interest because it appears to finally deliver proof that fighting inflammation offers a promising new way to counter heart disease in patients who already get cholesterol-lowering treatment.

Subsequently, some analysts boosted their revenue estimates for the Novartis medicine into the billions of dollars, while awaiting the data announced on Sunday.

Canakinumab is already approved as Ilaris for rare autoimmune conditions.

Vas Narasimhan, Novartis’s head of global drug development, said the drugmaker plans to go to regulators in the fourth quarter to seek approval for canakinumab to treat heart-attack victims with high levels of inflammation.

He downplayed critics who said the benefit was small, saying that one large subgroup in the so-called Cantos trial had shown a 27 percent reduction in cardiovascular risk.

Novartis also plans to underscore canakinumab’s potential cancer fighting properties with the European Medicines Agency and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

SEPARATE TRIALS

That’s after an analysis of Cantos data found total cancer mortality among patients getting canakinumab was significantly lower than in those receiving the placebo.

Narasimhan, who said the company now plans to start separate cancer trials for canakinumab, said the drug could be particularly suitable for smokers with risks of both lung cancer and heart problems.

With the oncology findings promising but only preliminary, the company is planning additional studies in lung cancer starting next year, he said.

Ilaris now costs about $200,000 per patient annually for treating rare immune conditions and brings in some $400 million in yearly sales for the Swiss company, though its price is likely to be slashed should it win approval in the heart setting.

Novartis initially struggled with the sluggish launch of its last heart drug, the $4,500-per-year Entresto, so it is understandably concerned about the reception for canakinumab.

While Narasimhan said it was too early to discuss pricing, he argued so-called PCSK9 cholesterol drugs that cost about $14,000 annually should not be relied on as a yardstick.

“In view of the additional oncology findings, we don’t think you should just think about this as a cardiovascular drug,” Narasimhan said. “I don’t think you can necessarily just make comparisons to existing benchmarks, such as the PCSK9s.”

Even so, Tim Anderson, a Bernstein analyst, said the “marginal” data are not compelling enough to dispel what for Novartis will remain a pricing conundrum, should canakinumab’s approval be expanded for heart patients.

“If the company cuts the price of the product in its current orphan indications, then it instantly sacrifices sales which currently total about $400 million per year with the hope that future sales in a new CV setting will more than offset this,” Anderson said in a note.

“Some have wondered whether a particularly high-risk subgroup could be identified where canakinumab’s current price can be justified,” he said. “We are not hopeful here.”"	Novartis hopeful for novel heart drug, despite 'modest' benefit	2017-08-27 19:20:42	http://www.reuters.com/article/us-novartis-heart-drug-idUSKCN1B70AY	story_reviews_00181	true
"Specialists at The Christie and The University of Manchester have made a breakthrough which could potentially improve detection and treatment of anal cancer, as well as have wider implications for other cancers.

Anal cancer is a rare form of cancer, but cases have increased dramatically in recent years. Research is urgently needed to improve detection and treatment and to save lives. The findings of this project will play a crucial role in these efforts going forward.

Funded by the Bowel Disease Research Foundation (BDRF) charity, the work has been published in the Lancet Oncology journal.

The study worked with data on more than 10,000 patients, examining whether current methods of checking if anal cancer has spread to lymph nodes are giving experts an accurate picture of survival rates. The research team was led from Manchester, working hand in hand with centres in Leeds and Switzerland.

Anal cancer that has spread to lymph nodes is linked to a worse prognosis and lower chance of survival.

The project's findings however have uncovered a phenomenon suggesting rates of lymph node spread are being overestimated, potentially leading to overtreatment of patients with chemo radiotherapy.

This can result in damaging side-effects, and doctors are particularly keen to avoid it in cases where it offers little benefit to the patient at potentially great cost.

The results will be crucial to future large scale trials looking at optimum care for anal cancer patients. By identifying a unique phenomenon, these results will be taken into account by future work and ultimately could lead to better diagnosis of tumour stage and thus better treatment.

Christie consultant and University of Manchester Professor of Cancer Studies and Surgery, Andrew Renehan, leads the Manchester Cancer Research Centre (MCRC) Anorectal Organ Preservation Research Group. He said: ""These high-profile results will play a vital part in improving patient care. Our research team has done a wonderful job highlighting an important and as yet unrecognised issue in the staging of cases of anal cancer.

""These findings will help us to better understand how anal cancer patients should be treated, ultimately improving survival rates and quality of life. It is crucial that we tackle what is becoming an increasingly common form of cancer through research studies like this. These findings could provide learnings for other cancers too.""

Christie patient Jill De Nardo, who is 58 from Buxton, was diagnosed with anal cancer in 2010. She said: ""My first thought on diagnosis was that I wanted to survive, I gave little thought to long term or late effects of treatment. Fortunately my treatment has been successful and seven years on my own late effects are manageable but will only get worse. Many are not so fortunate and live daily with the discomfort and impact of side effects such as joint pain and continence issues.""

Jill adds: ""Anal cancer is on the increase and those of us who have been through what at times was gruelling radiotherapy regimen, welcome this study and the impact it will have on the treatment plans of patients in the future.""

"An herb widely used in traditional Chinese medicine might hold the key to a new osteoporosis therapy that could prevent bone loss without causing side effects.

Using a compound derived from red sage, UBC researchers have found a way to selectively block an enzyme called Cathepsin K (CatK), which plays a major role in the breakdown of collagen in bones during osteoporosis. The findings were published today in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research.

""The development of osteoporosis drugs by pharmaceutical companies has focused heavily on blocking CatK in recent years,"" said Dieter Brömme, a professor in the faculty of dentistry and a Canada Research Chair in Proteases and Disease. ""All clinical trials to date have failed due to side effects ranging from stroke, skin fibrosis and cardiovascular issues. We've found a way to block CatK only in bone tissue that we think will prevent these other negative effects.""

The researchers tested a compound derived from red sage in human and mouse bone cells and a mouse model. They found that it prevented bone loss and increased the bone mineral density of the mice treated with the compound by 35 per cent, when compared with the control group.

The study builds on previous research by Brömme and his team that looked at the effectiveness of red sage, known as Danshen in Chinese and used to treat bone ailments, in stopping the activity of CatK in limited ways.

Enzyme blockers work like keys in locks. Most drugs in development have been so called active site-directed inhibitors, which act like master keys and lock the entire enzyme, blocking both its disease-relevant functions such as collagen degradation and its other normal functions.

""CatK is a multifunctional enzyme with important roles in other parts of the body and we think completely blocking it is what causes unexpected side effects in other drugs,"" said Preety Panwar, a research associate in the Brömme lab. ""Our compound only locks the collagen -degrading CatK activity, preventing the unregulated breakdown of collagen in bones without any other negative impacts.""

The treatment could also potentially be used to treat a variety of other bone and cartilage diseases such as arthritis and certain bone cancers.

Osteoporosis is a global health problem that will affect one out of three women and one of out five men worldwide, with a multi-billion-dollar pharmaceutical industry dedicated to finding treatments to stop its progression.

"Lynden, WA - August 24, 2017 - Initial findings from several studies - including both human subjects and animals - on the potential health benefits of red raspberries were presented earlier this year at the 2017 Experimental Biology conference in Chicago. Participants in short-term human trials experienced an improvement in glucose control and increased satiety, while longer-term animal trials revealed promising effects on the gut microbiota after red raspberry intake. The observations from animal and in vitro studies provided insights that support future hypotheses for red raspberry research exploring potential beneficial effects on pathways related to reducing inflammation, obesity, and type 2 diabetes risk.

""We are excited about this new flurry of studies, which builds on previously published research aimed to better understand the potential health benefits of red raspberries,"" said Tom Krugman, Executive Director of the National Processed Raspberry Council (NPRC). ""Our Council is committed to delivering the highest quality nutrition and health science that consumers can use to make informed choices when aiming for a healthy diet.""

While additional research, particularly in humans, is warranted, preliminary evidence from these studies suggests that the actions of essential nutrients, fiber, and polyphenolic phytochemicals found in red raspberries may play a role in supporting key metabolic functions, including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and metabolic stabilizing activity. While this emerging research is promising, and contributes to the overall understanding of the health benefits of red raspberries, conclusions cannot be drawn at this time.

Blood Sugar Control

In this human trial, investigators from the Center for Nutrition Research at the Illinois Institute of Technology looked at two study groups: obese individuals with impaired fasting glucose and hyperinsulinemia (PreDM) and healthy weight individuals with normo-glycemia and insulinemia. Participants experienced a significant reduction in postprandial glucose when 2 cups (250g) of red raspberries were consumed with meals compared to no raspberries. The glucose lowering was accompanied with less insulin suggesting improved insulin sensitivity in individuals with pre-diabetes and insulin resistance.

Satiety

In a secondary objective of the blood sugar control study, researchers found that subjects in the PreDM group who reported the highest level of hunger at baseline experienced greater satiety after the control meal compared to raspberry containing meals (p<0.05). In contrast, the healthy weight participants experienced significantly greater hunger suppression and wanted to eat less after a breakfast containing 2 cups (250g) of red raspberries compared to a calorie-matched control meal without raspberries. Because this study was limited to three meals, further research is needed to determine the factors that influenced outcomes.

Gut Health

In an eight-week pilot study, researchers from the Institute for Food Safety and Health from the Illinois Institute of Technology examined the impact of consumption of red raspberry purée or fructo-oligosaccharide on the gut microbiota and the subsequent bioavailability of red raspberry polyphenols in healthy volunteers. Consumption of the red raspberry puree and the fructo-oligiosaccharide for 4 weeks resulted in decreased Firmicutes and increased Bacteroidetes, which was more pronounced after red raspberry intake. Additionally, a type of bacteria called Akkermansia that has been associated with metabolic health was increased during red raspberry intake only. These preliminary results are promising. Further research is needed to support the hypothesis that the consumption of raspberry puree may change the composition of the gut microbiota.

Dr. Giuliana Noratto and colleagues of the Department of Food and Nutrition Science at Texas A&M; University studied if dietary supplementation with red raspberries could modulate the fecal microbiota of obese mice with diabetes and dyslipidemia. In this animal study, raspberry supplementation was associated with higher levels of Lachnospiraceae - a family of bacteria that can be depleted during diseases of the intestinal tract, such as inflammatory bowel disease. These findings provide a basis for formulating hypotheses for conducting additional studies, particularly in human trials.

Type 2 Diabetes

In an animal study, mice fed 5% freeze dried raspberry for 12 weeks, showed signs of improved insulin resistance and reduced inflammation in skeletal muscle while consuming a high-fat diet. These data corroborate a short-term study in humans reported by Xiao and colleagues at the same meeting supporting further work in humans to provide additional insight into these findings.

A research team from the University of Michigan studied the potential biologically active properties of red raspberries with in vitro assays including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacities. Follow-up research explored the potential relationship between feeding freeze-dried whole raspberry powder and cardiometabolic risk in obesity prone rats. Red raspberries were found to upregulate the expression of specific cardiac-protective molecular proteins (myocardial adiponectin, its receptor 2, and apolipoprotein E). Rats fed the red raspberries also experienced altered nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase mRNA, a protein associated with multiple functions in conditions related to obesity and type 2 diabetes. More research is needed to determine if compounds in red raspberries play a role in human cardiometabolic pathways.

Inflammation

In a mouse model, red raspberry supplementation of 5% dry feed weight was found to suppress inflammation and facilitate epithelium repair compared to mice with induced colitis (inflammation of the colon) and fed a standard chow diet. These observations are not conclusive, and further research is needed to determine if red raspberry supplementation supports epithelial function in humans.

"WASHINGTON--A new dietary review of 49 observational and controlled studies finds plant-based vegetarian diets, especially vegan diets, are associated with lower levels of total cholesterol, including lower levels of HDL and LDL cholesterol, compared to omnivorous diets. The meta-analysis appears as an online advance in Nutrition Reviews.

The study authors--Yoko Yokoyama, Ph.D., M.P.H., Susan Levin, M.S., R.D., C.S.S.D., and Neal Barnard, M.D., F.A.C.C.--reviewed 30 observational studies and 19 clinical trials, which met their inclusion criteria. They find:

A plant-based vegetarian diet is associated with total cholesterol that's 29.2 mg/dL lower in observational studies. In clinical trials, a plant-based diet lowers total cholesterol by 12.5 mg/dL.

In observational studies, a plant-based vegetarian diet is associated with a 22.9 mg/dL reduction in LDL cholesterol and a 3.6 mg/dL reduction in HDL cholesterol, compared to control groups following an omnivorous diet.

In clinical trials, a plant-based vegetarian diet lowers LDL cholesterol by 12.2 mg/dL and reduces HDL cholesterol by 3.4 mg/dL, compared to control groups following an omnivorous, low-fat, calorie-restricted, or a conventional diabetes diet.

A plant-based vegetarian diet is not associated with statistically significant changes in triglyceride levels in observational studies or in clinical trials.

The authors predict the strong correlation between vegetarian diets and lower cholesterol levels may be due to the association a plant-based diet has with a lower body weight, a reduced intake of saturated fat, and an increased intake of plant foods, like vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, and whole grains, which are naturally rich in components such as soluble fiber, soy protein, and plant sterols.

The study authors hypothesize that the greater risk reduction for total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol levels observed in the longitudinal studies is likely due to long-term adherence to plant-based eating patterns and changes in body composition.

""The immediate health benefits of a plant-based diet, like weight loss, lower blood pressure, and improved cholesterol, are well documented in controlled studies,"" says study author Susan Levin, M.S., R.D., C.S.S.D. ""Our goal with studying plasma lipids throughout the lifespan is to capture the net risk reduction of using a vegetarian diet to control lipid levels. We hope to empower patients with new research about the long-term cardiovascular health benefits of a vegetarian diet, which include a reduced risk of a heart attack, stroke, and premature death.""

Charles Ross, D.O., a member of the nonprofit Physicians Committee and a former emergency department physician, has firsthand experience with putting a plant-based diet into practice.

Dr. Ross is in his late 60s, takes no medications, and lowered his previously high total cholesterol from 230 mg/dL to a healthy 135 mg/dL after adopting a whole-food, plant-based diet in 2012. Within the first month of making the dietary change, he effortlessly lost 10 pounds. Within a year, Dr. Ross traded a 34-year career of practicing emergency medicine for a new career path: lifestyle medicine. After 5.5 years of making the career switch, he continues to host free biweekly nutrition classes for his primary care patients and the community. More than 700 people have enrolled to learn how to lose weight, eliminate the need for medications to treat type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and elevated cholesterol, and to simply feel better. His former hometown of Roseburg, Ore., is now a Blue Zones community. He is a part-time instructor at the College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific Northwest and hopes to set an example for future physicians.

""I no longer work for a living,"" notes Dr. Ross, who now resides in Westfir, Ore. ""I wake up every day eager to hear about how a plant-based diet and a healthful lifestyle is changing and saving lives in our community. What I've found is that if you want your patients to make significant health changes, you have to make them yourself. The prescription started to spread soon after my family, co-workers, neighbors, and friends heard about my experience.""

For clinicians concerned about spending extra time in and outside of the exam room, the study authors encourage time-strapped health care providers to refer patients to registered dietitians who can help with the transition to a plant-based vegetarian diet. The 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans highlights a healthy vegetarian diet as one of three healthful eating plans to follow.

The study authors also note hyperlipidemia, or elevated cholesterol and triglycerides, is often underdiagnosed and undertreated. A 10 percent increase in the prevalence of treatment for hyperlipidemia can prevent 8,000 deaths each year. Taking small steps, like those proposed by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel 3, which include assessing heart disease risk, making lifestyle and dietary recommendations, and assessing the need for future follow-up appointments and pharmaceutical interventions, could prevent approximately 20,000 heart attacks, 10,000 cases of coronary heart disease, and save almost $3 billion in medical costs each year.

""To make any form of health care work and to truly power economic mobility, we have to get healthy,"" says Levin. ""The first place to start is by building meals around nutrient-packed, plant-based foods, which fit into nearly every cultural template, taste preference, and budget.""

"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Aug. 22, 2017) - A study led by researchers at Cedars-Sinai and NeuroVision Imaging LLC provides the scientific basis for using noninvasive eye imaging to detect the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's. The experimental technology, developed by Cedars-Sinai and NeuroVision, scans the retina using techniques that can identify beta-amyloid protein deposits that mirror those in the brain.

Accumulations of neurotoxic beta-amyloid protein can be detected with positron emission tomography, or PET scans, and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid, but these are invasive, inconvenient and costly, making them impractical for routine screening and follow-up evaluation.

""This is the first study demonstrating the potential to image and quantify retinal findings related to beta-amyloid plaques noninvasively in living patients using a retinal scan with high resolution. This clinical trial is reinforced by an in-depth exploration of the accumulation of beta-amyloid in the retina of Alzheimer's patients versus matched controls, and a comparison analysis between retina and brain pathologies. Findings from this study strongly suggest that retinal imaging can serve as a surrogate biomarker to investigate and monitor Alzheimer's disease,"" said Maya Koronyo-Hamaoui, Ph.D., an associate professor of Neurosurgery and Biomedical Sciences and a research scientist at the Maxine Dunitz Neurosurgical Institute at Cedars-Sinai, and a co-founder, inventor and scientist at NeuroVision. She is the senior leading author of an article in JCI Insight published online Aug. 17.

""As a developmental outgrowth of the central nervous system that shares many of the brain's characteristics, the retina may offer a unique opportunity for us to easily and conveniently detect and monitor Alzheimer's disease,"" said Keith L. Black, M.D., chairman of NeuroVision, chair of the Department of Neurosurgery and director of the Maxine Dunitz Neurosurgical Institute at Cedars-Sinai. ""We know that Alzheimer's begins as many as 10 or 20 years before cognitive decline becomes evident, and we believe that potential treatments may be more effective if they can be started early in the process. Therefore, screening and early detection may be crucial to our efforts to turn the tide against the growing threat of this devastating disease.""

Steven Verdooner, NeuroVision CEO, said the imaging system leverages the company's expertise in autofluorescence imaging of the retina using a specialized ophthalmic camera and sophisticated image processing software. ""It's exciting to see these studies demonstrating the power of the technology applied to the Alzheimer's field. Our goal is to develop a product that is easy to use, affordable and widely accessible. We look forward to the potential of retinal imaging playing a vital role in solving the problem of Alzheimer's, both in identifying and monitoring those who may be affected by the disease. Our next step is to continue with clinical trials, building upon the existing pharmaceutical company collaborations, to ensure our technology is ready for the medical community to help manage this disease.""

The study's first author, Yosef Koronyo, a research associate at Cedars-Sinai and a scientist and inventor at NeuroVision, said the latest findings cap a decade of study that has produced several landmark discoveries. ""In 2010, our research group published an article providing the first evidence for the existence of Alzheimer's-specific plaques in the human retina, and we demonstrated the ability to detect individual plaques in live mouse models using a modified ophthalmic device.""

After adapting the technology for human application, the researchers initiated several ongoing clinical trials in the United States and Australia to determine the feasibility of detecting and quantifying beta-amyloid plaques in patients with the disease.

In the new article, the researchers report on a 16-patient clinical trial to demonstrate the feasibility of identifying beta-amyloid in the eye using autofluorescence imaging. They also provide detailed analyses and several new findings on Alzheimer's pathology in the retina, results of research with donated eyes and brains of 37 deceased patients, 23 with confirmed Alzheimer's disease and 14 controls.

Among key findings, the researchers report a 4.7-fold increase in retinal plaque burden in patients with Alzheimer's, compared to controls, and they provide observations regarding geometric distribution and layer location of amyloid pathology in the retina. With the imaging technology's ability to detect autofluorescence signal related to retinal beta-amyloid, these findings may lead to a practical approach for large-scale identification of the at-risk population and monitoring of Alzheimer's, the researchers say.

The article provides new insights into the disease's manifestations in the retina and information on the optical imaging system. Here are several highlights:

The first histologic quantitative analysis of retinal plaque clusters, or ""hot spots,"" containing the most toxic forms of beta-amyloid with specific distribution patterns in superior peripheral regions that were previously unexplored.

A detailed analysis of beta-amyloid deposit types using electron microscopy.

The first report of certain Alzheimer's-related pathologies in the retina, including vascular amyloid pathology.

The demonstration of a significant correlation between retinal and brain plaques, and coexistence of neuronal loss.

The first feasibility study for noninvasively detecting presumed amyloid deposits in retinas of living patients.

The demonstration of a fully automated calculation quantifying retinal autofluorescence that showed a 2.1-fold increase in patients with Alzheimer's, compared with controls.

"OTTAWA, ON - August 21, 2017 - Researchers at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO) looked at the incidence of and risk factors associated with sedation-related adverse events in pediatric emergency departments as part of a multi-centre observational study published today in JAMA Pediatrics.

When children and youth present at an emergency department and require an immediate painful procedure, it is standard to sedate the patient so they can tolerate the treatment. Procedural sedation is commonly used for painful or uncomfortable procedures like setting fractures, repairing lacerations and draining abscesses in emergency departments worldwide.

""Although sedation-related serious adverse events occur infrequently, recognition and early intervention is necessary to ensure patient safety,"" said Dr. Maala Bhatt, lead author, director of pediatric emergency research at CHEO, and assistant professor at the University of Ottawa. ""We've been able to identify sedation medications and practices associated with the best clinical outcomes, which is practice-changing.""

According to the authors, this study represents the largest and most robust prospective emergency department procedural sedation cohort to date. It includes children from six emergency departments across Canada, sedated with six different medication combinations.

The results of the study show that choice of sedation medication had the biggest impact on the incidence of adverse events and need for significant interventions in response to those events. The incidence of serious adverse events was lowest among patients sedated with ketamine-alone and highest among patients sedated with combination drugs ketamine plus propofol or fentanyl.

The overall incidence of adverse events in the study population was 11.7%. The most common events were a decrease in oxygen saturation (5.6%) and vomiting (5.2%). Significant interventions in response to an adverse event were rare, occurring in only 1.4% of children. Two other practices - receiving an opioid prior to sedation and having a laceration repair - were associated with the occurrence of vomiting, oxygen desaturation and need for significant interventions.

""The low rate of serious adverse events and significant interventions supports the safety of procedural sedation in the hands of emergency department physicians,"" said Dr. Bhatt. ""While all sedation medications and combination of medications are effective and safe in the hands of experienced providers, ketamine-alone is associated with the fewest serious adverse events and significant interventions, making it a logical choice for providing procedural sedation for children in emergency departments.""

"WASHINGTON -- A large proportion of the world's estimated 9.3 million breast cancer survivors experience menopausal symptoms or clinical manifestations of estrogen deficiency. A comprehensive review published in the Endocrine Society's Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism focuses on current and future approaches to management of menopausal symptoms after breast cancer.

Menopause is a normal part of a woman's aging process but pre-menopausal women treated with chemotherapy can also develop premature menopause, and consequently, severe menopausal symptoms including sleep disorders, vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA), vasomotor symptoms (VMS), mood changes, depressive symptoms, cardiovascular disease, osteopenia, and osteoporosis. Hormone therapy may help relieve a woman's menopausal symptoms but is not recommended for women who have had breast cancer.

""Following breast cancer, women should generally not be treated with menopausal hormone therapy but should instead focus on lifestyle modifications such as smoking cessation, weight loss, and regular physical activity,"" said the study's first author, Richard J. Santen, M.D., of the University of Virginia Health System in Charlottesville, Va. ""Pharmacologic agents are also available to treat women with severe symptoms. The most important thing to remember is that therapy must be individualized based on each woman's needs and goals.""

Santen and colleagues reviewed controlled clinical trials, observational studies, evidence-based guidelines, and expert opinion from professional societies to address the gap in treatment recommendations for management of menopausal symptoms after breast cancer.

The review's recommendations include:

Smoking cessation, weight loss (if indicated), limiting or avoiding alcohol, maintaining adequate levels of vitamin D and calcium, eating a healthy diet, and regular physical activity are suggested for all women with prior breast cancer

Non-pharmacologic therapies for VMS such as cognitive behavioral therapy, hypnosis, and acupuncture may be helpful as are vaginal lubricants and moisturizers

Several emerging approaches such as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), Tissue selective estrogen complex (TSECs), estetrol, and neurokinin B inhibitors show promise as useful agents to expand options for symptom relief with less breast cancer risk but have not yet been tested to confirm safety in women with prior breast cancer

"Philadelphia, PA, August 14, 2017 - Stanford University scientists have described a new type of test that can detect genetic mutations in minute amounts of DNA released from cancer cells into the blood. The test, which is called single color digital PCR, requires only a fraction of a tube of blood and can detect as few as three mutation-bearing molecules in a single reaction. According to the report in The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics, this highly sensitive test has the potential to be personalized to recognize mutations unique to any individual cancer.

""For monitoring patient tumors, only a handful of blood tests are available which are limited to only several types of cancers. Nearly all cancer patients require monitoring by whole body imaging, which can be costly, complex, and time-consuming. In contrast, molecular tests like the one we have developed will enable patients to be monitored at every visit, and thus have the potential for quickly tracking cancer growth and spread. Moreover, the test's rapid turnaround and relatively low cost, especially compared to next-generation DNA sequencing, provide a potential opportunity for universal monitoring of more patients than is currently done,"" explained lead investigator Hanlee P. Ji, MD, Associate Professor in the Department of Medicine at Stanford University and Senior Associate Director of the Stanford Genome Technology Center.

The report describes the use of the test to analyze samples from six patients. Five patients were previously diagnosed with colorectal cancer and one with cholangiocarcinoma.

After generation of customized mutation detection assays, the researchers were able to identify tumor-derived circulating DNA from three out of six patients. In one patient, the assay was able to show the presence of three different mutations. The three patients, whose samples did not show elevated cancer DNA, were undergoing active treatment at the time of collection.

The single-color digital PCR test offers several advantages over other methods of circulating tumor DNA analysis, compared to next-generation targeted sequencing and fluorescent probe-based digital PCR assays. The main advantage is that the new technique does not rely on pre-amplification, which can introduce errors and biases.

""This test is simple enough to set up and analyze without extensive training, and therefore, it can be implemented by anyone, making it highly accessible to any laboratory. It has been truly motivating to work with a technology that will help transform the way that we monitor and treat individuals with cancer. I am excited to share our findings with the cancer research community,"" noted lead author and researcher Christina Wood Bouwens, of the Stanford Genome Technology Center and the Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California.

"What if eating chocolate helped prevent and treat diabetes? It's crazy enough to laugh off.

But here's the thing: BYU researchers have discovered certain compounds found in cocoa can actually help your body release more insulin and respond to increased blood glucose better. Insulin is the hormone that manages glucose, the blood sugar that reaches unhealthy levels in diabetes.

Of course, there's a catch.

""You probably have to eat a lot of cocoa, and you probably don't want it to have a lot of sugar in it,"" said study author Jeffery Tessem, assistant professor of nutrition, dietetics and food science at BYU. ""It's the compound in cocoa you're after.""

When a person has diabetes, their body either doesn't produce enough insulin or doesn't process blood sugar properly. At the root of that is the failure of beta cells, whose job it is to produce insulin. The new study, published in the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry, finds beta cells work better and remain stronger with an increased presence of epicatechin monomers, compounds found naturally in cocoa.

To discover this, collaborators at Virginia Tech first fed the cocoa compound to animals on a high-fat diet. They found that by adding it to the high-fat diet, the compound would decrease the level of obesity in the animals and would increase their ability to deal with increased blood glucose levels.

The BYU team, comprised of graduate and undergraduate students in Tessem's lab and the labs of Ben Bikman and Jason Hansen (BYU professors of physiology and developmental biology), then dove in and dissected what was happening on the cellular level -- specifically, the beta cell level. That's when they learned cocoa compounds named epicatechin monomers enhanced beta cells' ability to secrete insulin.

""What happens is it's protecting the cells, it's increasing their ability to deal with oxidative stress,"" Tessem said. ""The epicatechin monomers are making the mitochondria in the beta cells stronger, which produces more ATP (a cell's energy source), which then results in more insulin being released.""

While there has been a lot of research on similar compounds over the past decade, no one has been able to pinpoint which ones are the most beneficial or how exactly they bring about any benefit -- until now. This research shows the epicatechin monomers, the smallest of the compounds, are the most effective.

""These results will help us get closer to using these compounds more effectively in foods or supplements to maintain normal blood glucose control and potentially even delay or prevent the onset of type-2 diabetes,"" said study co-author Andrew Neilson, assistant professor of food science at Virginia Tech.

But rather than stocking up on the sugar-rich chocolate bars at the checkout line, researchers believe the starting point is to look for ways to take the compound out of cocoa, make more of it and then use it as a potential treatment for current diabetes patients. This research was funded, in part, thanks to grants from the Diabetes Action Research and Education Foundation and the American Diabetes Association.

"LOS ANGELES (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUG. 14, 2017, AT 10 A.M. EDT ) - Cardiac stem cell infusions could someday help reverse the aging process in the human heart, making older ones behave younger, according to a new study from the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute.

""Our previous lab studies and human clinical trials have shown promise in treating heart failure using cardiac stem cell infusions,"" said Eduardo Marbán, MD, PhD, director of the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute and the primary investigator of the study. ""Now we find that these specialized stem cells could turn out to reverse problems associated with aging of the heart.""

The study was published today by the European Heart Journal.

In the study, investigators injected cardiosphere-derived cells, a specific type of stem cell, from newborn laboratory rats into the hearts of rats with an average age of 22 months, which is considered aged. Other laboratory rats from the same age group were assigned to receive placebo treatment, saline injections instead of stem cells. Both groups of aged rats were compared to a group of young rats with an average age of 4 months.

Baseline heart function was measured in all rats, using echocardiograms, treadmill stress tests and blood analysis. The group of older rats underwent an additional round of testing one month after receiving cardiosphere-derived cells that came from young rats.

""The way the cells work to reverse aging is fascinating,"" Marbán said. ""They secrete tiny vesicles that are chock-full of signaling molecules such as RNA and proteins. The vesicles from young cells appear to contain all the needed instructions to turn back the clock.""

Results of those tests show lab rats that received the cardiosphere-derived cells:

Experienced improved heart function

Demonstrated longer heart cell telomeres, compound structures located at the ends of chromosomes that shrink with age

Improved their exercise capacity by an average of approximately 20 percent

Regrew hair faster than rats that didn't receive the cells

""This study didn't measure whether receiving the cardiosphere-derived cells extended lifespans, so we have a lot more work to do,"" said Lilian Grigorian-Shamagian, MD, PhD, co-primary investigator and the first author of the study. ""We have much to study, including whether CDCs need to come from a young donor to have the same rejuvenating effects and whether the extracellular vesicles are able to reproduce all the rejuvenating effects we detect with CDCs.""

Since Marbán's team completed the world's first cardiac stem cell infusion in 2009, the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute has made significant contributions to decoding and understanding how cardiac stem cells regenerate damaged heart muscle. The team is studying the use of stem cells to treat patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy as well as patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, a condition that affects more than 50 percent of all heart failure patients.

General support for Marbán's laboratory is provided by the National Institutes of Health. The CDCs, manufactured by Capricor Inc. (NASDAQ: CAPR) as their product CAP-1002, have been used in other human clinical trials.

The process to grow cardiac-derived stem cells was developed by Marbán when he was on the faculty of Johns Hopkins University and further developed at Cedars-Sinai. Capricor has licensed the process from Johns Hopkins and from Cedars-Sinai for clinical and commercial development. Capricor has licensed additional intellectual property from Cedars-Sinai and the University of Rome. Cedars-Sinai and Marbán have financial interests in Capricor.

"New research shows that resistance training protects the brain in persons with multiple sclerosis, which may delay the development of the disease

In the past, multiple sclerosis patients were advised not to exercise for fear of exacerbating the illness. However, it is now known that physical training can relieve many of the symptoms, including the excessive fatigue and mobility impairments that are often seen. New research now shows that resistance training may protect the nervous system and thus slow the progression of the disease.

This is the main finding of a study conducted by a research partnership between Aarhus University, Aarhus University Hospital, the University of Southern Denmark and the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, that has just been published in Multiple Sclerosis Journal.

The study shows that resistance training has a number of positive effects on the brain, which go beyond what can be achieved through effective disease specific medication.

""Over the past six years, we have been pursuing the idea that physical training has effects on more than just the symptoms, and this study provides the first indications that physical exercise may protect the nervous system against the disease,"" says one of the researchers behind the study, Associate Professor Ulrik Dalgas from the Department of Public Health at Aarhus University.

""For the past 15 years, we have known that physical exercise does not harm people with multiple sclerosis, but instead often has a positive impact on, for example, their ability to walk, their levels of fatigue, their muscle strength and their aerobic capacity, which has otherwise often deteriorated. But the fact that physical training also seems to have a protective effect on the brain in people with multiple sclerosis is new and important knowledge,"" says Ulrik Dalgas.

In the study, the researchers followed 35 people with multiple sclerosis for six months. Half of the group engaged in resistance training twice a week, while the other half continued to live their lives normally without systematic training.

Prior to and following the six-month period, the test subjects had their brains MR-scanned, and the researchers could see that there was a tendency for the brain to shrink less in those patients who undertook resistance training.

""Among persons with multiple sclerosis, the brain shrinks markedly faster than normal. Drugs can counter this development, but we saw a tendency that training further minimises brain shrinkage in patients already receiving medication. In addition, we saw that several smaller brain areas actually started to grow in response to training,"" says Ulrik Dalgas.

The researchers behind the study are still unable to explain why training has a positive effect on the brain in people with multiple sclerosis. A bigger and more in-depth on-going study will help to clarify this, and may also lead to improved treatment options, says Ulrik Dalgas. However, he stresses that the aim is not to replace medication with physical training.

""Phasing out drugs in favour of training is not realistic. On the other hand, the study indicates that systematic physical training can be a far more important supplement during treatment than has so far been assumed. This aspect needs to be thoroughly explored,"" says Ulrik Dalgas.

It is not yet clear whether all people with multiple sclerosis can benefit from this type of exercise, as it has not been sufficiently tested in the more severely affected patients. Therefore, Ulrik Dalgas is not recommending that all multiple sclerosis patients throw themselves into intensive physical training regimes without first seeking professional advice.

Facts,

Multiple sclerosis is an incurable disease of the central nervous system.

There are about twice as many women as men with multiple sclerosis.

Eighty per cent of people with multiple sclerosis live with the disease for more than 35 years.

The disease is found in both aggressive and more benign forms.

The cause of the illness is unknown, but both genetic and environmental factors play a role."

"Researchers at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center and Ohio State's College of Engineering have developed a new technology, Tissue Nanotransfection (TNT), that can generate any cell type of interest for treatment within the patient's own body. This technology may be used to repair injured tissue or restore function of aging tissue, including organs, blood vessels and nerve cells.

Results of the regenerative medicine study published in the journal Nature Nanotechnology.

""By using our novel nanochip technology, injured or compromised organs can be replaced. We have shown that skin is a fertile land where we can grow the elements of any organ that is declining,"" said Dr. Chandan Sen, director of Ohio State's Center for Regenerative Medicine & Cell Based Therapies, who co-led the study with L. James Lee, professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering with Ohio State's College of Engineering in collaboration with Ohio State's Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center.

Researchers studied mice and pigs in these experiments. In the study, researchers were able to reprogram skin cells to become vascular cells in badly injured legs that lacked blood flow. Within one week, active blood vessels appeared in the injured leg, and by the second week, the leg was saved. In lab tests, this technology was also shown to reprogram skin cells in the live body into nerve cells that were injected into brain-injured mice to help them recover from stroke.

""This is difficult to imagine, but it is achievable, successfully working about 98 percent of the time. With this technology, we can convert skin cells into elements of any organ with just one touch. This process only takes less than a second and is non-invasive, and then you're off. The chip does not stay with you, and the reprogramming of the cell starts. Our technology keeps the cells in the body under immune surveillance, so immune suppression is not necessary,"" said Sen, who also is executive director of Ohio State's Comprehensive Wound Center.

TNT technology has two major components: First is a nanotechnology-based chip designed to deliver cargo to adult cells in the live body. Second is the design of specific biological cargo for cell conversion. This cargo, when delivered using the chip, converts an adult cell from one type to another, said first author Daniel Gallego-Perez, an assistant professor of biomedical engineering and general surgery who also was a postdoctoral researcher in both Sen's and Lee's laboratories.

TNT doesn't require any laboratory-based procedures and may be implemented at the point of care. The procedure is also non-invasive. The cargo is delivered by zapping the device with a small electrical charge that's barely felt by the patient.

""The concept is very simple,"" Lee said. ""As a matter of fact, we were even surprised how it worked so well. In my lab, we have ongoing research trying to understand the mechanism and do even better. So, this is the beginning, more to come.""

Researchers plan to start clinical trials next year to test this technology in humans, Sen said.

"There is a group of metastatic breast cancers that has the HER2 gene amplified - the cells have many copies of it - which leads to enhanced activity of the product enzyme, a tyrosine kinase. HER2 has been established as a therapeutic target in breast cancer, and breast cancers in which the HER2 gene is not amplified do not, in general, respond to HER2-directed therapeutic approaches.

A few years ago, when the research teams of Dr. Matthew Ellis and others carried out a molecular characterization of breast cancer tumors, they found a new mutation in HER2 that was different from gene amplification but also resulted in tyrosine kinase being constantly activated.

""In this particular activation mechanism, the cells develop a subtle mutation within the functional part of the HER2 gene that activates the enzyme,"" said Ellis, professor and director of the Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center, part of the National Cancer Institute-designated Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center at Baylor College of Medicine. ""The mutation locks the enzyme into an 'on' position.""

Ellis and his colleagues developed a preclinical model to study this new HER2 mutation and discovered that the enhanced enzymatic activity could trigger tumor formation. Furthermore, these tumor cells were sensitive to an experimental drug, neratinib. With this information in hand, the researchers took the next step.

""We launched a phase II clinical trial of neratinib in patients with metastatic breast cancer carrying a HER2 mutation,"" Ellis said. ""Finding patients that are positive for a HER2 mutation required a national collaboration because we had to screen hundreds of patients to identify the 2 to 3 percent that have a tumor driven by a HER2 mutation. The results of the clinical trial were encouraging in that about 30 percent of the 16 patients treated with neratinib had a meaningful clinical response showing significant disease stabilization or regression. Neratinib was well tolerated by most patients.""

""This is the first time we had a reasonable number of patients treated for HER2 mutations in whom we could estimate the response rate.""

The number of patients who could potentially benefit from this new treatment approach is estimated to be in the thousands. The researchers estimate that as many as 200,000 patients are likely to be living with metastatic breast cancer today in the United States. Based on the estimate that the new mutation is present in 2 to 3 percent of cases, the researchers calculated that approximately 4,000 to 6,000 patients with metastatic breast cancer carry a HER2 mutation and are therefore potential candidates for neratinib treatment.

Circulating tumor DNA analysis, a promising diagnostic tool

To identify the patients in this study who carried the new HER2 mutation, the researchers required tissue from the tumor, a biopsy, from which they could extract and sequence the genetic material to determine the presence of the HER2 mutation. This task turned out to be a major challenge because for 20 to 30 percent of the patients the researchers did not have sufficient material to make the diagnosis.

""To assist in our ability to identify patients with HER2 mutation-positive tumors, we conducted circulating tumor DNA analysis,"" Ellis said. ""The tumor's DNA is released into the human bloodstream, and we were able to determine the presence of the mutation in blood samples from the patients. Importantly the circulating tumor DNA results were highly concordant with the tumor sequencing results, and they were much easier to determine. Notably, the blood test was sensitive enough that we could use it as a tool to determine eligibility for the clinical trial.""

In addition to bringing to the table a novel treatment for metastatic breast cancer carrying a HER2 mutation, the researchers have tested the value of the circulating tumor DNA as a disease-monitoring marker.

""A circulating tumor DNA-based blood test also could therefore be potentially used to monitor tumor progression and to determine whether patients are responding or not to treatment after just one month of therapy,"" Ellis said.

"Morristown, N.J., Aug. 7, 2017 - As we age, managing healthy weight may become more difficult due to a slowing metabolism, however, help may come from a fiery source -- the capsicum pepper. A recent paper, Capsaicinoids Enhance Metabolic Rate in Normal Healthy Individuals using a Novel Metabolic Tracker Breezing Device-An Open Label Placebo Controlled Acute Study, published in the journal Obesity Open Access discussed the findings of the Metabolic Rate (MR) Study, which demonstrated that an extract from red hot peppers boosted metabolic rate (Chen, et al., 2017).

""Because capsaicinoids (the component of hot peppers that gives them heat) are hot, it was imperative that we use an ingredient which the subjects could tolerate,"" said Vijaya Juturu, Ph.D., F.A.C.N., one of the lead researchers on the MR Study. ""Since Capsimax is made using a proprietary beadleting technology, OmniBead, which coats the capsicum extract, releasing it only when it reaches the intestines where it is absorbed without discomfort, we were able to deliver beneficial levels of capsaicinoids to our subjects, which made the MR Study possible.""

The MR Study was a placebo-controlled, crossover open label study with 40 healthy adults examining the effects of either 2 mg capsaicinoids from 100 mg of Capsimax or placebo on resting energy expenditure, heart rate and blood pressure. Resting energy expenditure is the amount of energy required by the body during resting conditions and accounts up to 60% of the calories you burn each day and so increasing this amount can aid in managing weight. The study showed that supplementing with this low dose of Capsimax increased metabolic rate which calculated to an equivalent to burning an extra 116 calories per day. Moreover, though resting energy expenditure varies with each individual, this increase would yield almost 1 lb. of fat lost over 30 days.

""Aging is inevitable, but that doesn't mean we can't be active participants in our weight management as we age,"" said Abhijit Bhattacharya, President of OmniActive Health Technologies Ltd., producers of Capsimax. ""Capsimax is supported by multiple studies with findings showing safety, increased lipolysis and satiety and improved healthy body composition. Now, with the publication of the MR Study, there is yet another demonstrated benefit of Capsimax as a natural, stimulant-free approach to weight management, sports nutrition and a healthy lifestyle as we age.""

"An analysis of two influential studies of prostate cancer screening concludes that the much-debated test “significantly” reduces deaths from the disease, suggesting that current recommendations against routine PSA screening might be steering men away from a lifesaving procedure.

The analysis, published Monday in Annals of Internal Medicine, drew wildly different reactions, as is often the case with research on PSA screenings. Some experts in cancer screening and statistics said its novel approach was “on shaky ground” and used a “completely unverifiable” methodology that they had “never seen before,” but others praised its “intriguing and innovative approach.” There was one area of agreement, however: “I imagine it’s going to generate some buzz,” said biostatistician Ted Karrison of the University of Chicago.

If the new analysis is correct, one of the influential PSA studies, called PLCO, reduced deaths from prostate cancer by 27 percent to 32 percent, not the zero percent that PLCO researchers themselves found. For a man in the U.S., the risk of dying of prostate cancer is about 2.5 percent. A mortality reduction of 30 percent would lower the death rate to 1.75 percent, said epidemiologist Ruth Etzioni of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the study’s senior author.

“If a screening test reduces cancer mortality by 20 percent, it’s considered a successful test,” Etzioni said. “I think the [prostate-cancer] mortality reduction we calculate is a significant benefit. This is a screening test that saves lives.”

Those gains come at some cost to health, though: For every life saved, she estimated, five men will be told they have cancer when in fact their abnormal cells would never grow, spread, or harm them. In other estimates, such “overdiagnoses” outnumber lives saved by 50-to-1.

The new study lands amid another shift in how experts view PSA screening, which measures blood levels of a molecule sometimes associated with prostate cancer. In 2012 the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, whose recommendations help determine that procedures insurance should cover, recommended against routine PSA tests because of their many risks and tiny benefits. Among other drawbacks, the tests lead to overdiagnosis (meaning a biopsy finds malignant cells but they are so innocuous they would never harm, let alone kill, the man) as well as incontinence and impotence from treatment (including of harmless cancers).

In April, however, the task force proposed instead that men aged 55 to 69 discuss PSA’s pros and cons with their doctor and then decide what to do, factoring in that if 1,000 men get regular PSA screening for a decade it will save about one life. (Older and younger men are still advised not to have routine screening.)

The rationale for the re-analysis led by Etzioni is that the PLCO study was a bit of a mess. It assigned half of its nearly 77,000 participants, men ages 55 to 74, to have yearly PSA tests and the other half to not do so. But 46 percent of the men in the no-PSA group had yearly PSAs anyway. As a result, when researchers counted deaths in each group, it wasn’t a clean comparison: Rather than comparing screened to unscreened men, they were comparing assigned-to-screening men to not-assigned-to-screening men.

The finding that assigned-to-screening men were no more likely to avoid death from prostate cancer might therefore have been because their screening behavior wasn’t different enough from the “unscreened” (but in fact partly screened) men’s, not because PSA screening doesn’t save lives.

In an effort to untangle that possibility, Etzioni and 21 co-authors from 10 countries created multiple mathematical models. They all rely on estimates of “lead time,” or how much sooner a cancer is detected because of PSA instead of because symptoms are detected. The models incorporated the records of all the PLCO men and ignored which group they’d been assigned to.

Bottom line: Screened men’s cancers were detected earlier than unscreened men’s, and more frequent screening advanced detection more. That moved some prostate cancers from too-advanced-to-treat to treatable, reducing prostate cancer mortality by 27 percent to 32 percent over 11 years, Etzioni and her colleagues conclude.

Researchers not involved in the study weren’t convinced. “The concern is that men in the no-screening group but who chose to get screened anyway might differ in important ways from men who stayed with no-screening,” Karrison said. They might be more health conscious or conscientious, or have other traits associated with longevity. If so, then those traits, not screening, might be responsible for their lower risk of dying from prostate cancer. Two prominent experts in cancer prevention and statistics agreed, but said they did not want to be publicly identified as criticizing the new analysis because some of its authors are colleagues of theirs.

Dr. Kenneth Lin of Georgetown University Medical Center, a former staffer at the USPSTF, said crediting PSA tests with reducing prostate cancer mortality by around 30 percent was probably an overstatement, especially since mathematical models are only models. An earlier one for the PLCO study concluded that more men died in its screening group than in the don’t-get-screened group. “Models are models,” Lin said. “No matter how sophisticated, they shouldn’t trump data from real people who participated in the randomized trials” — which in PLCO found zero lives saved from PSA screening.

A researcher associated with the Preventive Services Task Force, but who was not permitted to speak to reporters while the group is finalizing its PSA recommendation, said the panel would incorporate the new paper in its analysis. “But honestly,” he said, “I don’t know that this adds a great deal to our understanding.”"	PSA saves lives, a new analysis finds. Not everyone agrees	2017-09-04 06:00:00	https://www.statnews.com/2017/09/04/prostate-cancer-analysis/	story_reviews_00176	true
"After years of growing doubt about the value of screening men for prostate cancer, a new analysis of existing clinical trial evidence has found that when men between 55 and 70 get the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, the result is lives saved.

In 2009, a New England Journal of Medicine editorialist famously called the debate over PSA testing for prostate cancer “the controversy that refuses to die.” That comment came with the publication of two clinical trials — one conducted in the United States, the second in Europe — that drew two contradictory conclusions on prostate cancer testing.

The U.S. undertaking, called the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening (PLCO) Trial, found that screening men for prostate cancer does not save lives. The European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer suggested that screening drove down the rate of deaths from prostate cancer by 20%.

In 2012, a federally funded panel of experts on preventive care concluded there are more risks than benefits to screening American men for prostate cancer with the PSA test. And in April 2017, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force dumped the decision squarely into the laps of patients and their doctors. Some men between 55 and 69 years of age might well decide to get their PSA checked, the task force said. After hearing the ledger of pros and cons, however, others in that age bracket might just as reasonably skip the screening test, the panel concluded.

The new research, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, now calls those recommendations into question. The authors of the study, led by biostatistician Ruth Etzioni of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, concluded that screening men over age 55 “can signiﬁcantly reduce the risk for prostate cancer death.”

When men who fit the criteria for screening get the PSA test, the reduction in deaths due to prostate cancer was between 25% and 32%, the new study found.

But the newly published analysis also underscores that the value of prostate cancer screening rests heavily on which men you screen, where and for how long you conduct the clinical trial, and how you crunch the numbers.

In the end, said Vanderbilt University urological surgeon Dr. Sam Chang, the new analysis “reinforces what urological surgeons and treating physicians have thought all along: that PSA screening is helpful.”

But it is helpful, said Chang, only when it focuses on the right men — those between 55 and 70 — and when it is tempered by an understanding that not all worrisome findings are evidence of disease that should be treated aggressively.

Sometimes, said Chang, who was not involved in the newly published article, a man will get a problematic PSA test reading and decide not to act on it immediately or aggressively. But knowing there is a decision to be made is probably a better basis for planning than not knowing, he added.

“Over the past five to 10 years, there has been a better understanding by everyone about the harms of over-treatment,” Chang said. “You want to avoid over-diagnosis and over-treatment.”

Chang underscored that for two groups in particular — African American men and those with a first-degree relative who died of prostate cancer — knowing is especially important, because the risks of aggressive disease in such populations is much higher than for others. Neither group was the subject of special attention in the newly published analysis.

In an editorial published alongside the new analysis, Andrew Vickers of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center also made clear that it’s what patients and their physicians do after the PSA test that matters most.

“Unfortunately, the way screening has been implemented in the United States leaves much to be desired,” Vickers wrote. “The controversy about PSA-based screening should no longer be whether it can do good but whether we can change our behavior so that it does more good than harm,” he added.

Prostate cancer is the most common nonskin cancer found in men, affecting 101.6 of 100,000 American men, according to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention. In 2013, the latest year for which figures are available, 176,000 got a diagnosis of prostate cancer and 28,000 died of it.

But a change in a man’s reading on the PSA test is a highly imperfect gauge of trouble: approximately 80% of positive PSA test results are thought to produce false-positives, creating scares that prompt men to get biopsies. And treatment, which carries with it a high risk of subsequent difficulties with sexual function, urination and bowel movements, is often unnecessary because prostate cancers are often so slow-growing they will never make a man sick.

As a result of this growing skepticism about whom to screen for prostate cancer and whether to treat it, more and more men are skipping the PSA test. And among those who get it and get back a worrisome finding, fewer and fewer are opting to treat it.

Earlier this year, a long-running clinical trial found no evidence that patients who got an early prostate cancer diagnosis and chose “active surveillance” (sometimes called watchful waiting) were no more likely to die of the disease than were men who got the same diagnosis and treated it aggressively.

"Longest study of its kind concludes current prescribing guidelines are correct, and that statins show impressive benefits for men with high cholesterol levels

This article is more than 2 years old

Statins cut the risk of dying from heart disease by 28% among men, according to the longest study of its kind.

The 20-year project examined data from 2,560 men taking part in a randomised clinical trial to test the effects of statins versus a placebo.

All the men had very high levels of LDL, or “bad” cholesterol, (higher than 4.9mmol/L) but had no evidence of heart disease at the start of the study.

Nearly all men over 60 and women over 75 eligible for statins, analysis suggests Read more

Researchers from Imperial College London and the University of Glasgow found impressive results among those on statins, who were given the widely-prescribed type pravastatin.

They found that compared with the placebo, there was a 27% reduced risk of coronary heart disease, a 28% reduced risk of dying from coronary heart disease, and a 25% reduced risk of coronary “events” such as a heart attack.

There was also an 18% reduced risk of dying from any cause over the 20-year period.

Senior author Professor Kausik Ray, from Imperial’s School of Public Health, said: “For the first time, we show that statins reduce the risk of death in this specific group of people who appear largely healthy except for very high LDL levels.

“This legitimises current guidelines which recommend treating this population with statins.”

Ray said people with lower levels of cholesterol, around 4mmol/L, who otherwise appear healthy, should also be treated with statins.

Statins prevent 80,000 heart attacks and strokes a year in UK, study finds Read more

Ray added: “This is the strongest evidence yet that statins reduce the risk of heart disease and death in men with high LDL.

“Our study lends support to LDL’s status as a major driver of heart disease risk, and suggests that even modest LDL reductions might offer significant mortality benefits in the long-term.

“Our analysis firmly establishes that controlling LDL over time translates to fewer deaths in this population.”

Professor Sir Nilesh Samani, medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: “This research further demonstrates the benefits of statins for people who have high levels of cholesterol in their blood.

“It shows the enduring and long-term benefit of taking statins, including the extent to which they reduce the risk of dying from heart disease, which can only be seen in a study of this length.

"OKLAHOMA CITY, Sept. 7, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Arthrokinex announces the release of IRAPjoint™ therapy in the USA. This therapy has recently been highlighted by several professional football players traveling to Europe for treatment. The process works by using one's own blood – specifically the body's own anti-inflammatory proteins and human-growth elements – to end or ease pain and chronic injuries.

Recently a well-known Seattle Seahawks player and four of his teammates are sitting out a week of training camp to receive a blood-healing treatment from a European supplier an IRAP-based treatment solution. Other NBA, MLB and NHL superstars have also utilized the treatment.

This treatment was developed by a German physician, Dr. Peter Wehling, in the 1980s. By using one's own blood – specifically the body's own anti-inflammatory proteins and human-growth elements – to end or ease pain and chronic injuries. During the process, blood is drawn from the patient and then injected back into the pained joint.

A European company and their U.S. affiliate started using IRAP to treat joint pain from inflammation in the 1980s; the price reported was $10,000. The European-based process was the inspiration for Dr. Barreto of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma to work on developing a stronger, more effective, and more cost-efficient version in the United States.

After years of development and process optimization, the U.S. product IRAPjoint™ is now ready. Significantly better concentration, healing/pain reduction durability, faster production (just one hour), one-fifth the price, and chemical additive free, IRAPjoint™ is now available in multiple physician practices throughout the United States.

IRAPjoint™ is produced through a single blood draw which is enough for a full year's treatment of up to 12 injections. Typically, the treatment process is painless and just takes a few minutes and consists of one injection per week for three weeks, followed by quarterly injections, as needed. Success has been achieved in knees, hip and shoulder joints.

Finally, a U.S. based company has a solution for America's professional and weekend athletes as well as those struggling with aching or arthritic joints. It's a non-drug, non-surgical treatment derived from your own blood. The cost of the USA-based IRAPjoint™ treatment is $2,000 compared to the reported price of $10,000 for a foreign competitor.

"BOSTON (Sept. 11, 2017)--Adding 48 minutes of moderate exercise per week is associated with improvements in overall physical functioning and decreases in risks of immobility in older adults who are sedentary, finds a new study led by researchers at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging (USDA HNRCA) at Tufts University.

In the study, published in PLOS ONE on Aug. 18, the researchers evaluated how different doses of exercise for adults age 70-89 would impact the benefits. While the researchers saw improvements in all participants who added some physical activity to their routine, those who got more exercise saw greater changes. The work is part of the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study.

""These are people who want to live healthy, independent lives and are at risk for losing that. Maintaining functional independence for older adults is an important public health issue. In our first LIFE study, we confirmed that regular exercise can help improve physical function and prevent mobility loss. Now we see that small increases can have big impacts,"" said first and corresponding author Roger A. Fielding, senior scientist and director of the Nutrition, Exercise Physiology, and Sarcopenia Laboratory at the USDA HNRCA.

For the LIFE study, the researchers analyzed data from 1,635 men and women age 70-89 over an average of 2.6 years. Half were randomly assigned to a program of walking and walking-based strength, flexibility and balance training; half participated in health education workshops. All had low levels of physical functioning at the start and reported fewer than 20 minutes per week of regular physical activity in the month prior to starting the study. Participants were evaluated at baseline, six, 12, and 24 months. The researchers relied on movement monitors and self-reporting to measure physical activity outside study sessions.

Changes in activity were significantly greater in the physical activity intervention group than the health education group from baseline through 24 months. There was a continuous, graded effect with the greatest benefits seen in the participants who engaged in at least 48 minutes of physical activity per week. The greater differences were also associated with prevention of major mobility loss.

""Our goal was to have participants walking up to 150 minutes per week. To see benefits at 48 minutes is encouraging. We wanted the physical activity sessions to include exercise that participants could do outside of the study, and we hope that learning of these results might motivate others to try to make safe, incremental changes to their activity levels. Reducing muscle loss, functional decline, and loss of independence are important to anyone, at any age, and at any physical ability,"" said Fielding.

The researchers acknowledge limitations of this study, including examining the different quantities of exercise participation achieved in the LIFE study participants and not specifically prescribing different amounts of exercise to different study groups. In addition, there were differences in the measured absolute amounts of exercise performed when comparing objective activity monitoring using a wearable ""device"" and self-report of physical activity.

Small increases in physical activity reduce immobility, disability risks in older adults	2017-09-08 06:00:00	https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-09/tuhs-sii091117.php	news_reviews_00172	true
"Warfarin is a blood thinner that is commonly prescribed to patients to prevent life-threatening blood clots. Despite its longtime use, warfarin remains tricky to dose because a person's genetic makeup influences how the drug is processed in the body. Too much warfarin can cause internal bleeding; too little warfarin fails to prevent blood clots.

Now, a new study led by Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis shows that dosing warfarin (Coumadin and others) is safer -- producing fewer adverse events such as hemorrhage -- when key elements of a patient's genetic makeup are considered.

The research, published Sept. 26 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, reports results from the clinical trial known as GIFT (Genetics Informatics Trial of Warfarin to Prevent Deep Venous Thrombosis).

""Physicians have been prescribing warfarin since the Eisenhower administration,"" said first author Brian F. Gage, MD, a professor of medicine at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. ""It's a widely used anticoagulant, but it causes more major adverse events than any other oral drug. Thousands of patients end up in the emergency department or hospital because of warfarin-induced bleeding. But we continue to prescribe it because it is highly effective, reversible and inexpensive. So our goal is to make warfarin safer. GIFT showed that precision-medicine based on clinical factors and three genes improves the safety of initiating warfarin therapy.""

Patients in the trial were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group received warfarin dosing based on standard factors such as age, height and weight; the second group was dosed based on these clinical factors plus genetic variants. Participating sites in the trial included Washington University School of Medicine, Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, Intermountain Healthcare, University of Utah, and Rush University Medical Center.

Of the 789 patients who were dosed in the traditional manner, 116 experienced at least one adverse event (14.7 percent). Of the 808 patients whose warfarin dosing was guided by genetic testing, 87 experienced an adverse event (10.8 percent). Compared with patients receiving traditional warfarin dosing, patients dosed with the genetic approach had a 27 percent reduction in adverse events, which was statistically different. The adverse events were bleeding, formation of blood clots in the veins and warfarin overdoses. No patient died during the trial.

Earlier studies looking at whether genetic testing could improve warfarin dosing had produced conflicting results. However, these studies were smaller and considered fewer genes than GIFT. GIFT enrolled 1,600 patients age 65 and older at high risk of blood clots because they underwent hip- or knee-replacement surgeries.

Unlike prior studies, GIFT took into account genetic variants in three genes for 11 days of warfarin therapy. Genetic variants were assessed on a commercial platform called GenMarkDx. Variants in one gene affect vitamin K recycling. Variants in another gene affect warfarin sensitivity. Variants in the third gene alter warfarin metabolism in the liver and can cause an overdose if the dose is not adjusted soon enough.

""There are additional genetic variants that may help to guide warfarin dosing, especially among patients with African ancestry,"" Gage said. In the future, we hope to quantify how these variants affect warfarin.""

Gage also noted how health-care costs relate to dosing warfarin in a genetically guided manner. ""Although genetic testing is more expensive than clinical dosing, the cost is falling,"" he said. ""In our study, we estimated that genetic testing costs less than $200 per person, which is less than one month of a newer anticoagulant.""

MONDAY, Sept. 11, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- New research suggests that Opdivo -- a drug that works with the immune system to fight melanoma -- is more effective than the current standard of care for patients who've had surgery to remove advanced tumors.

The international study was funded by Opdivo's maker, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and included more than 900 patients with stage III and stage IV melanoma.

Patients were treated at 130 medical centers across 25 countries. All underwent surgery for their cancer before they began treatment with either Opdivo (nivolumab) or Yervoy (ipilimumab), the drug that's the current standard of care.

Both drugs are ""immunotherapies,"" which work by boosting the immune system's ability to spot and destroy tumor cells.

After a year of treatment, 71 percent of patients in the Opdivo group were alive without any recurrence of the disease, compared with 61 percent of those treated with Yervoy. And at 18 months, the rate was 66 percent for Opdivo and 53 percent for Yervoy, the findings showed.

According to the Skin Cancer Foundation, metastatic melanoma accounts for only about 1 percent of skin cancer cases but causes the majority of skin cancer deaths.

""Our results demonstrate that [Opdivo] is more effective in treating patients with stage III and IV melanoma, cutting the risk of relapse by a third,"" lead researcher Dr. Jeffrey Weber, professor of medicine at NYU School of Medicine, said in a university news release.

""Results like this will change how we practice medicine. Hopefully, physicians will embrace the use of [Opdivo] in these high-risk patients as adjuvant therapy,"" added Weber, who also helps direct NYU's Perlmutter Cancer Center in New York City.

One cancer surgeon who reviewed the findings was impressed.

""Based on this study, it appears that patients with advanced melanoma who have their disease completely removed by surgery should go on to receive additional therapy with Opdivo,"" said Dr. Gary Deutsch. He is a surgical oncologist at Northwell Health's Imbert Cancer Center in Bay Shore, N.Y.

""Not only did these patients have a better survival outcome at one year, but they had only one-third the side effects compared to Yervoy,"" Deutsch said.

The study found that patients taking Opdivo had fewer severe side effects than those taking Yervoy, at 14 percent versus 45 percent. Five percent of patients on Opdivo had to stop treatment due to side effects, compared with 31 percent of those on Yervoy. The most common side effects for both drugs were fatigue and diarrhea.

Weber added that ""the safety of [Opdivo] is very promising.""

The study is scheduled for presentation Monday in Madrid, Spain, at the annual meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology. It was also published online Sept. 10 in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Both Opdivo and Yervoy are already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat advanced (metastatic) melanoma. In some patients, the drugs are used in combination.

Dr. Michele Green is a dermatologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. She said any advance in the care of aggressive melanomas is welcome news for patients.

""It is amazing that there is now an alternative that is superior to conventional chemotherapy for advanced metastatic disease,"" Green said after reviewing the new study findings. ""With these advanced melanomas -- that have high risks of recurrences and have poor outcomes -- it is vital to look at alternative treatments. The future in cancer treatments lies in immunotherapy and other targeted options.""

"Is it time for you to begin screening for colorectal cancer? Screening looks for signs of cancer in someone who doesn't have any symptoms. The idea is that by catching cancer early, before it spreads, it's easier to treat.

Stool Screening Tests

One way to look for signs of colorectal cancer is to see if there are microscopic amounts of blood in the stool using a high-sensitivity fecal occult blood test, or FOBT. Occult, in this case, means hidden. ""It's an indirect indicator the patient could be harboring polyps [precancerous growths in the colon],"" says Dr. Sreeram Maddipatla, medical oncologist/hematologist for the Liver Center and Pancreas Center at UF Health Cancer Center – Orlando Health. Although blood in the stool can mean there's a tumor or polyps, it can also be a sign of something much less serious, like hemorrhoids.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved two types of fecal occult blood tests and one stool DNA test:

Guaiac FOBT. This was the first stool test for colorectal screening, says Dr. Robin Mendelsohn, a gastroenterologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Mendelsohn says the concept for the guaiac FOBT originated from the idea that colon cancer bled into the colon and then into the stool. Guaiac FOBT detects heme – an iron compound in the blood that carries oxygen – in the stool. The guaiac FOBT is not specific to human heme, Mendelsohn says, so if you consume meat before the test, it could affect the results.

To do a guaiac FOBT, you'll use a kit to collect stool from three different bowel movements and send the samples to a lab for analysis. ""[The need for three samples] is due to the intermittent nature of bleeding from a tumor,"" Mendelsohn says. If you choose this method of colorectal screening, you'll need to repeat the test yearly.

When a guaiac FOBT is performed every one to two years in adults 50 to 80 years old, it can reduce deaths from colorectal cancer by 15 to 33 percent, according to the National Cancer Institute.

Fecal immunochemical test, or FIT. The FIT detects human hemoglobin, Maddipatla says. It doesn't react to non-human blood, so there are no dietary restrictions prior to the test. Maddipatla says this test is easier than the guaiac FOBT, as it only requires one stool sample (which must be mailed back to the lab right away for an accurate result). Although other conditions, such as a lower gastrointestinal bleed, can produce a positive result, the FIT produces fewer false positives than the guaiac FOBT, Maddipatla says, and is almost equal to colonoscopy in reducing mortality from colorectal cancer. The FIT is approximately 80 percent sensitive for detecting cancer and 20 to 30 percent sensitive for detecting advanced polyps. ""The colonoscopy is still the gold standard,"" Maddipatla says.

Unlike a colonoscopy – a visual examination of the full length of the colon and rectum – the guiaic FOBT and FIT only detect cancers or polyps. A colonoscopy can help prevent cancer by removing polyps before they have a chance to develop into a tumor.

Many patients prefer the simplicity of stool testing to undergoing a colonoscopy. However, if you have a positive result with either a guaiac FOBT or FIT, you may have polyps or colon cancer, and you'll need to proceed with a diagnostic colonoscopy, Mendelsohn says. ""There's no point in doing [stool tests] if you're not willing to do a colonoscopy afterwards.""

FIT-DNA. You may have seen advertisements for the Cologuard FIT-DNA test. According to the NCI, Cologuard detects both tiny amounts of blood in the stool (the FIT portion) as well as nine biomarkers in three genes that have been found in colorectal cancer and advanced polyps. The NCI says for average-risk adults who didn't have symptoms, the FIT-DNA test detected more cancers and adenomas (advanced polyps) than the FIT, but had more false positives.

Mendelsohn says there are no long-term studies on FIT-DNA, so doctors aren't sure how frequently patients should undergo it. Medicare reimburses for the test every three years, she says, and depending on the manufacturer, the guidelines recommend repeating the test every one to three years. Mendelsohn says she is uncomfortable with the rate of false positives, which is about 10 to 13 percent. As with the guiaic FOBT and the FIT, a positive result means you still need to undergo a colonoscopy.

The Bottom Line

Adults at average risk for colorectal cancer should begin colorectal screening at age 50. Talk to your doctor about which test is right for you.

The Affordable Care Act and Medicare cover screening for colorectal cancer. Check with your insurer about which tests are covered and what your out-of-pocket costs might be."

"(Reuters Health) - Women who take hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to ease menopause symptoms like hot flashes and night sweats may be no more likely to die prematurely than women who don’t take hormones, a new study suggests.

Many women have been reluctant to use hormones for menopause symptoms since 2002, when the federally funded Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) study linked the treatments containing man-made versions of the female hormones estrogen and progestin to an increased risk of breast cancer, heart attacks and strokes.

The current study, however, looked at longer-term data from the WHI study and found no increased risk of death from all causes, or from cancer or cardiovascular issues in particular, associated with hormone use.

“Women seeking treatment for distressing hot flashes, night sweats or other menopausal symptoms may find the mortality results reassuring,” said lead study author Dr. JoAnn Manson of Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston.

Women go through menopause when they stop menstruating, typically between ages 45 and 55. As the ovaries curb production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone in the years leading up to menopause and afterward, women can experience symptoms ranging from irregular periods and vaginal dryness to mood swings and insomnia.

For the study, researchers looked at data on 27,347 women ages 50 to 79 who joined two WHI trials between 1993 and 1998 and were followed through 2014. One trial tested estrogen alone against a placebo, or dummy pill, while the other trial tested estrogen taken in combination with progestin.

Women were 63 years old on average when they joined the trials and had already gone through menopause. They took hormones or a placebo for five to seven years and were followed for a total of 18 years altogether.

During the study period, 7,489 women died.

Death rates were similar - at about 27 percent - among women who took hormones and women who didn’t, researchers report in JAMA.

Younger women in the study appeared to have better survival odds with HRT. Over the initial five to seven years when women were randomly assigned to take hormones or a placebo, death rates were about 30 percent lower among women aged 50 to 59 when they took HRT than when they didn’t.

For women who started hormones in their 60s or 70s, however, there wasn’t a meaningful difference in death rates according to whether they got the treatment or a placebo during the initial years of the study.

After 18 years, including both the treatment period and a decade or more of follow-up, women’s age when they joined the study no longer appeared to significantly influence death rates.

One limitation of the study is that the WHI didn’t look at different dosages of hormone pills, and the findings may be different for other dosages or different types of therapy such as gels or creams or skin patches.

Still, the current study should ease concerns raised by earlier results from the WHI trials that an increased risk of breast cancer or heart attacks might translate into higher long-term mortality rates, said Dr. Melissa McNeil, author of an accompanying editorial and a women’s health researcher at the University of Pittsburgh.

Taking a combination of estrogen and progestin is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, but advances in screening and treatment since the WHI started now mean these tumors are unlikely to be fatal, McNeil said by email.

With additional years of follow-up, it also appears that the increased heart attack risk associated with HRT in the initial results from the WHI trials is limited to older women, McNeil added.

“Hormone therapy has been in and out of favor - first it was good for all menopausal women, then it was dangerous for all women,” McNeil said. “The take-home message now is that for the right patient, hormone therapy is safe and effective.”

"A new powdered peanut product is the first food item allowed to claim it may reduce peanut allergies in infants, though parents of susceptible babies are urged to consult a doctor before trying it. The product, called Hello, Peanut, can be mixed into puréed baby food to expose infants to peanuts starting around five months old.

The Food and Drug Administration allowed the new item, developed by a physician, to make the claim just months after the nation’s top allergy experts reversed longstanding advice on preventing peanut allergies, dropping recommendations to withhold all peanut-containing foods in early childhood in favor of early, frequent exposure, starting with peanut powder or extract for infants beginning to eat solid food. The label warns that evidence is limited.

While many foods like whole grains, nuts and supplements carry qualified health claims stating that they may reduce the risk of diseases like cancer or heart disease, this is the first time a food product label will be allowed to make a qualified claim that it reduces the risk of an allergy, officials said. A qualified claim means there is evidence supporting the claim, but it is not conclusive.

“This is a very important claim for us to allow to be incorporated into food labels,” said Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the commissioner of the F.D.A. “The guidelines for how to approach allergens in children are changing, the science is changing, and it’s important for parents to know.”"	New Product Is First to Claim It May Reduce Peanut Allergies	2017-09-14 06:00:00	https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/well/family/new-product-is-first-to-claim-it-may-reduce-peanut-allergies.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fhealth&action=click&contentCollection=health&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=2&pgtype=sectionfront&_r=0	story_reviews_00171	true
"A new genetic testing kit that hits the market today is the most affordable, and arguably one of the simplest, ways for women to find out if they have an increased risk of developing breast cancer.

Here is what women should know about BRCA gene mutation testing, including how it works, who should actually consider getting it and the new convenient test that one woman already credits for helping detect her cancer early.

What are the BRCA genes?

The two BRCA genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2) normally help protect women from cancer, however, some women may have mutations to their BRCA genes, which can actually lead to cancer, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

If untreated, women with a BRCA gene mutation are seven times more likely to get breast cancer, and 30 times more likely to get ovarian cancer before the age of 70, when compared with women without the gene mutations, according to the CDC.

Should everyone take a BRCA gene test?

Medical professionals say no.

The BRCA test is ""absolutely not recommended for every single person,"" according to Dr. Jennifer Ashton, ABC News chief women's health correspondent.

She identified the criteria doctors want people to meet before being tested for BRCA, including:

1) A family history of someone having a positive BRCA mutation.

2) Ovarian cancer at any age in the family.

3) Breast cancer before the age of 50.

4) Triple-negative breast cancer before the age of 60.

5) Male breast cancer in the family at any age.

6) People of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry.

7) People who have had two or more cases of breast cancer, one occurring before the age of 50, on their mother’s or father’s side of the family.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against routine BRCA gene testing for women who do not have a family history associated with an increased risk for potentially harmful mutations in the BRCA genes, the group of preventative care experts wrote on their website.

The USPSTF does, however, recommend that women who have family members with breast, ovarian, tubal or peritoneal cancer should receive genetic counseling, and BRCA testing if recommended after counseling.

The Color BRCA gene test

Color

While the new Color BRCA genetic mutation test is not the only BRCA genetic test on the market, at $149 it is currently the cheapest, making gene testing more accessible to all women.

The Color test must be ordered by a physician, either through your own doctor, or an independent physician through the company. Users are asked to send a saliva sample -- which carries your D.N.A. -- to their lab, where it is analyzed. Results are then sent back to the user online in three to four weeks.

Dr. Valerie Montgomery Rice, a women's health researcher at the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia, told ABC News that ""one in eight [women] will get breast cancer in their lifetime.""

""So it's very important the women who are high-risk, we want them to have access to the test, and many of us believe [the price] makes it more affordable,"" Montgomery Rice said.

Devon Gant told ABC News that she used the Color test to find out that she tested positive for the BRCA 2 gene mutation.

ABC News

""It's kind of a black cloud,"" Gant said. ""It's this thing that's kind of looming in the future.""

Gant said that although there were times when she struggled with the test results, ""it's not a death sentence.""

When her aunt, Lauren Rossi, took a Color test and also got a positive result for a BRCA mutation, doctors sent Rossi for an MRI, she said.

ABC News

""That's when they found a couple of spots, said they didn't really think it was anything,"" Rossi told ABC News. ""And it came back that it was cancer.""

Rossi said that when she received the phone call she ""couldn't believe it.""

In part due to the genetic test, and the early detection, Rossi says she is now cancer-free.

""Thank God,"" she told ABC News. ""It would've been a totally different outcome, probably next February, when I went for, you know, for my mammography.""

She said that she is grateful that both she and Gant were tested for the BRCA gene mutation because it helped doctors detect cancer in her, and it empowers her niece with knowledge about her health.

""Now she knows,"" Rossi said of her niece. ""And she knows what she needs to do, and she'll stay healthy.""

'Window into the future'

Ashton describes genetic testing as showing a ""possible window into the future.""

""It doesn’t mean a guarantee because we know that genes are just one part of what determines someone’s future health risks,"" she said. ""Behavior and environment are also important.""

People should also be aware that it is possible now to test for over 30 gene mutations associated with different types of hereditary cancer, according to Ashton. Eight of those gene mutations are associated with breast cancer.

""While all the attention goes on BRCA, it is important for people to know they can have a gene mutation in other genes and it is readily available now to test for this,"" she said. ""This is a mainstream option which I think is good news for some people."""

"Update| Anyone who’s ever dieted knows that sorting through the deluge of research can be overwhelming. Paleo has a devout following who swear by its protein-heavy meals, while intermittent fasters believe that forgoing food for hours on end (which varies, but can include skipping meals for an entire day), provides the best results. For those who just can’t give up grains (or regular eating), a new study indicates that being less restrictive is actually better for your waistline.

Researchers from The University of Tasmania in Australia found that breaking up with your diet for two weeks could lead to more weight loss—and help you keep it off, too.

Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now

For the small study just published in the International Journal of Obesity, the team enlisted 51 obese men from the ages of 25 to 54 years old. All participants had maintained their current weight for six months leading up to the study and did not exercise regularly. One group of men followed the diet, which reduced calorie consumption by about one-third of their individual needs, for 16 weeks straight. The experimental group stuck to the eating plan for two weeks, before ditching the diet for two weeks. They repeated the cycle until they had also dieted for 16 weeks; however, in their case, each bout of restriction was followed by a period of eating enough calories for weight maintenance.

At the end of the study, the men following the intermittent diet plan lost 47 percent more weight than the control group. And while it’s common to regain a few pounds after returning to previous eating habits, the two-week dieters kept the pounds off, maintaining a nearly 18-pound loss six months after the study.

Krista Varady, an outside researcher who studies intermittent fasting (not the same as intermittent dieting) and weight loss at the University of Illinois, believes the results were significant.

""I was really impressed that they still saw almost a two kilogram weight loss during that last period at the end of the four months,"" she tells Newsweek. ""At that point we see almost zero weight loss,"" she explains of her own research. ""Somehow they’re kind of keeping the body on its toes.""

This trick may help combat the dreaded weight loss plateau that plagues dieters looking to lose those last five pounds. As we cut calories and lose weight, our resting metabolic rate eventually slows and our bodies become less efficient at shedding mass in a process known as adaptive thermogenesis. While frustrating, it’s one of our natural survival mechanisms to prevent potential starvation.

Another benefit from intermittent dieting? People who have a difficult time staying motivated may find relief by the two-week breaks. However, it’s important not to think of them as cheat days. The dieters ate enough calories to maintain their weight during the off period. But, Varady believes it’s probably safe to enjoy a slice of cake or bowl of ice cream during the break.

""It seemed like they probably had a couple of cheat days here and there,"" she says of the data. ""Diets tend to work if you have a couple of cheat days during the month. Just as long as it doesn’t psychologically derail people.""

"The big question: Will cancer immune therapy work for me?

SAN DIEGO (AP) — Dennis Lyon was a genetic train wreck. Cancer was ravaging his liver, lungs, bones and brain, and tests showed so many tumor mutations that drugs targeting one or two wouldn't do much good. It seemed like very bad news, yet his doctors were encouraged.

The reason: People with the most messed-up genes often are the ones who do best on treatments that enlist the immune system.

""These are the patients we used to be very depressed about,"" thinking they couldn't be helped, said Dr. Razelle Kurzrock at the University of California, San Diego. ""Now when we see those types of patients, we're really excited,"" because there are so many ways for the immune system to recognize the cancer cells as abnormal.

Immunotherapy is the hottest thing in cancer care. Drugs called checkpoint inhibitors can vanquish some advanced cancers by removing a chemical cloak that hides them from the immune system. Former President Jimmy Carter got one at age 91 for skin cancer that spread to his brain, and now is in remission.

But they're expensive, have side effects, and work for only about one-quarter of patients — as few as 5 percent with colon cancer and as many as half with the skin cancer, melanoma. Sometimes the benefits are brief.

Worst of all: For a small number of unlucky folks, treatment can backfire. Their cancer grows exponentially after getting a checkpoint drug.

""We're going to have to figure out not only who to treat with immunotherapy but who not to treat,"" Kurzrock said.

Gene tests are starting to help sort that out. But for patients, the big question is ""Will it work for me?""

PREDICTING WHO BENEFITS

The first step is testing for a protein called PD-L1 that's often involved in forming that chemical cloak. Some checkpoint drugs target this or a related protein, so people with a lot of it should respond to treatment.

That was the hope when Diane Tippett showed up last October at Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center with a salivary gland cancer that had spread to her liver and lungs.

""Five years ago, I probably would have thrown up my hands and given her standard chemo,"" said the center's director, Dr. Louis Weiner.

Instead, he ordered tests that showed Tippett had a PD-L1 mutation, meaning her cancer made a lot of it. He started the 49-year-old Leonardtown, Maryland, woman on a checkpoint drug, Opdivo, and told her to come back in a few months.

""Quite honestly, I didn't know if I'd ever see her again,"" he said.

Now, Tippett's lung tumors are gone. Her liver tumor shrank 50 percent and is stable. She got married in July and says she feels great.

""I don't feel any different than you do. I'm not tired, I've got all my hair,"" she said. ""I want more people to know about it and to ask their doctors about it,"" she said of immunotherapy and the testing that led her to it.

NOT THE WHOLE STORY

That protein isn't a very reliable predictor, though. Some people with a lot of it don't benefit from the drugs and the opposite also is true. There are other checkpoints besides that one, too.

Researchers increasingly are focusing on something else Tippett had: a high number of flawed genes. It's a sign that tumors have been evolving over time and are hard to treat with drugs that target a single gene. It sometimes accompanies two other DNA problems that some checkpoint drugs already are approved to treat.

Lyon, the San Diego man, had nearly two dozen different mutations after his skin cancer spread widely. In October 2015, he started on Opdivo and was in near-complete remission within two months. Recent tests showed no active cancer in his spine and lungs, and doctors think small spots in his brain and liver may be scar tissue, though they can't know for sure. A test for tumor DNA in his blood found none.

""It would appear my cancer is all dead,"" he said, and called it ""nothing short of miraculous"" that gene tests led to successful treatment after years of trial and error. ""I'm so grateful. No one's lucky that gets cancer but I may be in an era where there's a way through this tunnel.""

Three-quarters of patients who are helped by checkpoint drugs have long-lasting benefits, as Lyon did, said Dr. Steven O'Day, an immunotherapy expert at Providence Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California.

""When you respond, it's a home run in terms of long-term survival,"" O'Day said. ""But we still have to be better at predicting who those patients are.""

THE DARK SIDE

Others have not been so fortunate. In November, French researchers reported that 12 of 131 patients, or 9 percent, got much worse after checkpoint drugs, which seemed to speed their tumor growth.

Kurzrock checked with colleagues and quickly found more cases — a 73-year-old man with bladder cancer, a 65-year-old woman with endometrial cancer, and a 44-year-old breast cancer patient whose tumors ""just exploded"" in size within two months of immunotherapy.

In a report on 155 patients, she tied several gene mutations to this risk. Kurzrock has consulted for some gene-medicine makers and co-founded a company using a software program to determine best treatments for patients depending on their tumor genes.

The unfortunate cases are a reality check, said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society.

""We are not paying close enough attention to those people"" and need to know whether they fared badly because of their treatment or for other reasons, he said.

SHOULD WE BE DOING 'IMMUNOGRAMS'?

That's the question Dr. Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Translational Science Institute, posed a gene medicine conference he organized in March at the suburban San Diego research center. Should there be baseline tests to map what patients' natural defenses look like? For example, how many immune system soldiers called T cells do they have in the area of the tumor?

Max Krummel is working on a roadmap to do that. The University of California, San Francisco, scientist heads a project with $10 million from three companies that make checkpoint drugs. He is analyzing hundreds of tumor samples to see what immune system features spell success or failure.

""We're not looking at how the immune system changes,"" but for what starting point works best with the drugs, he said. ""What we're seeing is that the kinds of cells you have in a tumor predict who's going to respond.""

Krummel, who was involved in work that led to Yervoy, the first checkpoint drug, has started a company to try to tune up one part of the immune system he thinks is key to maintaining a healthy balance.

Cancer exists because the immune system isn't working as it should, he said, so successful immunotherapy may require ""treating the immune system, not treating the tumor.""

"This Test Can Determine Whether You've Outgrown A Food Allergy

Enlarge this image toggle caption Michelle Kondrich for NPR Michelle Kondrich for NPR

An estimated 4 percent of Americans have food allergies, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has concluded that allergies are a growing public health concern. But diagnosing allergies can be tricky, and kids can outgrow them, too.

Now, a new study sheds light on the effectiveness of a test called a food challenge to determine whether a person can tolerate a food they once reacted to.

Jula Cieciuch, a fifth-grader who lives in Telluride, Colo., recently took a food challenge to find out if she was still allergic to eggs.

When she passed, she was ecstatic. After years of avoiding all foods with eggs, she was a bit shocked. ""For so long, it was: You can't eat this. You can't eat this,"" Jula says. "" I was very emotional!""

She's also outgrown allergies to walnuts and almonds. ""It's a huge relief ... it has really opened up her diet — a lot,"" her mom, Kendall Cieciuch, told us. Once you can eat eggs, you can eat cakes and breads and frittatas, and lots of other baked goods.

Jula is still allergic to some foods, including milk and cashews, so she still needs to be careful. But Kendall says every time she's crossed a food off her allergy list, ""it makes life a little easier.""

Jula Cieciuch's story is not uncommon. About 70 to 80 percent of children with an egg allergy will outgrow it. And about 20 percent of kids outgrow peanut allergies.

In Jula's case, her allergists at National Jewish Health in Denver, Colo., repeated the standard allergy blood tests last summer. That's when they realized she may have outgrown her egg allergy.



The blood test measures the levels of a certain type of antibody, immunoglobulin E (IgE). The higher the level, the more likely a person is to have an allergic reaction. Jula's blood revealed a drop in antibody count.



But the only way to confirm that it was safe for Jula to eat egg was to take the food challenge test. Basically, the test entails eating small quantities of the foods you've been allergic to. The testing is done under medical supervision.

""What they do is give you a really small dose, like a crumb, basically,"" explains Jula. Then after 20 minutes or so, if you don't have any reaction, ""you can take a dose that's a little bigger."" If you can eat an entire egg, you pass.

A new study published in the Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology illuminates just how many people come to find out they can eat foods they've long avoided.



Researchers studied the results of about 6,300 food challenges. The tests were done in adults and children whom doctors suspected had become tolerant to foods they'd once reacted to.



""We found that 14 percent of the patients challenged had mild or moderate allergic reactions,"" explains study author Carla Davis, an allergist and director of the Food Allergy Program at Texas Children's Hospital. ""If the symptoms were treated with just Benadryl or another antihistamine, they were considered mild or moderate. She says 2 percent of the reactions were more serious, requiring treatment with epinephrine.

But the vast majority of patients, 86 percent, did not have an allergic reaction. In other words, they tolerated the food just fine. She says the results aren't that surprising, since allergists had classified these patients as low-risk for reacting to the foods they were being tested for.



""I think [the results] are very encouraging,"" Bruce Lanser, a pediatric allergist who directs the Pediatric Food Allergy Program at National Jewish Health in Denver, told us. He was not involved in the study, but he says the findings mirror what he sees in his clinical practice. ""We know a certain percentage will outgrow [their] allergies,"" Lanser says. ""And the last thing I want to miss is the opportunity to get a food into a kid's diet.""

He says many of the patients in the study may have outgrown their allergy, just like Jula did. ""But it's also possible [some of them] never truly had a food allergy."" As we've reported, people sometimes misinterpret the symptoms of a condition such as lactose intolerance for a food allergy.

Lanser says it can be tricky to diagnose food allergies. That's because the two main tests doctors use — the blood test and the skin prick test — only reveal part of the story. ""Both tests only measure sensitization,"" he explains. ""All they can tell us is how likely you are to react when you eat the food.""



And that's where the oral food challenge comes in. It's become the gold standard test to rule out an allergy.



So, if you or your child tested positive for a food allergy years ago, you may want to consider seeing an allergist again."

"(CNN) The headlines about football players and chronic traumatic encephalopathy - commonly known as CTE - seem endless. The most recent diagnosis of the neurodegenerative brain disease was given to former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez. But one of the biggest obstacles in understanding CTE has been the inability to diagnose it in the living. New research released Tuesday may make that possible. Published in the journal PLOS One, researchers have found a protein that can be a marker of this devastating disease.

""This is something new,"" said Dr. Ann McKee , a neuropathologist and senior author of the studyMcKee has performed many of the high profile diagnoses of CTE among former pro-football players and is director of the Boston University CTE Center.

An early step in the right direction

McKee also cautioned that this is still early research. ""The next step -- is repeating, validating our findings, and seeing if we can detect it in blood, and of course doing it in living subjects. These are critical next steps,"" she said.

CTE causes Alzheimer's-like symptoms, including memory loss, confusion, aggression, rage and, at times, suicidal behavior. It is believed to result from repeated trauma to the head, which causes a buildup of the abnormal protein tau which clumps in the brain.

In this new study, researchers found an increased amount of the protein CCL11 in patients previously diagnosed with CTE. CCL11 is a protein commonly associated with inflammation, a process which McKee said can be a trigger for the disease. ""Inflammation is normally a very helpful response in the brain, but when it goes on and persists for a long time, and gets out of control -- that's what we think happens in CTE,"" said McKee.

More exposure to football increases likeliness of CCL11

The paper evaluated the brains of 23 deceased football players with CTE, and compared them to the brains of 50 deceased people diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and the brains of 18 deceased non-athletes. When compared to the brains without CTE, researchers found those brains with CTE had significantly higher amounts of CCL11, even when compared to those brains with Alzheimer's, another degenerative brain disease. Furthermore, they found that the more years someone played football, the higher amount of the protein. However, contrary to the popularly held belief that a greater number of concussions are linked to CTE , no connection was found between levels of CCL11 and reported number of concussions. In addition, the number of reported concussions tend to be an unreliable indicator in general, because they are usually self reported.

Although there are different stages of the disease that indicate how far it has progressed, this study was unable to determine any connections between levels of CCL11 and severity of CTE.

""The findings of this study are the early steps toward identifying CTE during life. Once we can successfully diagnose CTE in living individuals, we will be much closer to discovering treatments for those who suffer from it,"" said McKee.

""It is a good step forward but I will be very conservative about the interpretations of the possible application to diagnosis,"" said Dr. Bennet Omalu, the neuropathologist credited with making the first diagnosis of CTE among professional football players. Omalu found traces of the disease in the brain of legendary Pittsburgh Steelers player and pro Hall of Famer Mike Webster in 2002.

While Omalu was cautiously optimistic about the development, he also noted that CCL11 isn't unique to the brain disease. ""This is an inflammatory marker that may be non-specific and may not be diagnostic of CTE,"" he said.

While it is hoped that this will be one avenue to help detect the disease in the living, McKee believes that it will just be one part of a larger process. ""This may be one of the abnormalities [of the disease], but it may take 2-3 to be useful to diagnose CTE,"" said McKee.

imaging. Previous studies have evaluated other potential biomarkers for CTE, including identifying the protein tau using brainimaging.

110 of 111 former NFL players found with CTE

A recent analysis by BU found evidence of CTE in 110 of 111 brains of former NFL players. However, there is a potential bias in that study, as relatives of these players may have submitted their brains for diagnosis due to clinical symptoms noticed while the players were alive.

CTE has been detected in veterans, as well as players of other contact sports; however, it has become most associated with football. Along with Hernandez, CTE has been diagnosed in San Diego Charger and Hall of Famer Junior Seau, as well as the Philadelphia Eagles' Kevin Turner and the Oakland Raiders' Ken Stabler, to name a few.

In 2015, a federal judge approved a class-action lawsuit settlement between the NFL and thousands of former players who accused the league of hiding the dangers of concussions and repeated head trauma. The agreement provides up to $5 million per retired player for serious medical conditions associated with repeated head trauma."

"Before the introduction of whooping cough vaccine in the 1940s, more than 200,000 cases a year were reported in the U.S. By 1965, that number plummeted to fewer than 10,000 a year. But the disease made a comeback in the 1990s, as the newer ""acellular"" vaccine — containing only cellular material but not whole cells — was phased in.

"MILAN, ITALY, Sept. 12, 2017 - An antibody treatment reduces the rate of flare-ups by nearly 20 percent in patients with a subgroup of treatment-resistant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), according to the results of two large international trials presented today at the European Respiratory Society International Congress in Milan, Italy, and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

""The goal of precision medicine is to give the right treatment to the right patient,"" said lead author Frank Sciurba, M.D., director of the Center for COPD and Emphysema and UPMC Pulmonary Function Exercise Physiology Laboratory, and visiting professor in the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. ""These findings are the first example of a precision therapy that is uniquely effective in a subgroup of patients with treatment-resistant COPD.""

COPD, a progressive lung disease characterized by airway obstruction and chronic lung inflammation, affects 30 million Americans.

""There is significant variation between patients in the cells and other proteins responsible for lung inflammation, so there are actually many different subtypes of COPD,"" said Sciurba.

One subgroup called eosinophilic predominant COPD is present in as many as 40 percent of patients and is characterized by elevated levels of a type of white blood cell known as eosinophils, he said.

The new study reports the results from two Phase III clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of mepolizumab, an antibody treatment that reduces the number of eosinophils in the blood, in moderate to severe treatment-resistant eosinophilic COPD by blocking the pro-inflammatory effects of interleukin-5.

Patients included in the trials were still having flare-ups despite a year of a standard treatment known as ""triple inhaled therapy"" that includes bronchodilators and glucocorticoids.

""These patients already have been given every treatment we have to offer them and are still having flare-ups that significantly interfere with their quality of life and can lead to deterioration in lung function and higher mortality,"" said Sciurba. ""We hoped to be able to offer them an option.""

Mepolizumab is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to reduce symptom flare-ups and improve quality of life in eosinophilic asthma.

The first trial, termed METREX, was conducted at 117 sites in 15 countries from 2014 to 2017. A total of 837 COPD patients were stratified by blood eosinophil counts and randomized to receive either 100 milligrams of mepolizumab or placebo, delivered under the skin every four weeks for one year.

The patients with high eosinophil counts who received mepolizumab had a statistically significant 18 percent lower rate of moderate/severe exacerbations (1.4 per year compared to 1.7 per year) than those in the placebo group. The exacerbation rate in the low eosinophil group treated with the biologic did not differ from placebo. The time to the first exacerbation also was higher with mepolizumab than placebo, but only in the high eosinophil group.

In a second, simultaneous trial, termed METREO, the team assessed the effect of a higher dose of mepolizumab in 675 patients with elevated eosinophil levels. Patients were randomized to receive 100 or 300 milligrams of mepolizumab or placebo, with the same delivery method and schedule as METREX.

Similar to METREX, the exacerbation rate was reduced by 20 percent in the high eosinophil group after 100 milligrams of mepolizumab. The METREO results narrowly missed statistical significance. The 300-milligram dose did not provide an advantage over the lower dose.

An analysis of data from both trials found that as baseline blood eosinophil counts increased, so did mepolizumab's reduction in the annual exacerbation rate. This finding indicates that patients with higher initial eosinophil counts benefited more from mepolizumab than those with lower eosinophil counts, Sciurba said. The safety profile of mepolizumab did not differ from placebo in either trial.

""In addition to providing a new treatment option for patients with treatment-resistant, moderate to severe COPD, the new results also are important because they identify a potential biomarker for the disease and demonstrate that eosinophilic inflammation plays a role in flare-ups in COPD,"" Sciurba said.

Pitt's Division of Pulmonology, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine has a legacy of pioneering treatments for lung disease. UPMC also is home to a leading lung transplant program.

""The findings in these trials exemplify what we hope to achieve not only in COPD but across all lung diseases with regards to a precision approach to treatment,"" said division chief, Rama Mallampalli, M.D.

"New investigation advises doctors to recommend cranberry products as first line of defense against repeated urinary tract infections (UTIs)

CARVER, Mass., September 19, 2017 - A thorough review of dozens of studies led scientists to conclude that healthcare professionals should be telling their patients to have cranberry products as a first step in reducing recurrent UTIs. The comprehensive meta-analysis and assessment of human clinical trials, published in the official journal of the American Urological Association, The Journal of Urology®, assures practitioners and their patients that cranberry products are a low cost, low risk and effective way to help prevent recurrent UTIs.1

To answer the question, ""Can Cranberries Contribute to Reduce the Incidence of Urinary Tract Infections?"" a total of 28 studies showing results from nearly 5,000 patients were considered. Authors found a statistically significant risk reduction in repeat UTIs overall, but not significant for any particular subgroup. However, patients with recurrent UTIs who ingested cranberry products and had undergone gynecological surgery, experienced a significant reduction in UTIs.

""Our investigation supports that cranberry products can be a powerful tool to fight off frequent UTIs,"" explains lead author, Dr. Ângelo Luís. ""While recommendations for dosage and duration of treatment require further study, the efficacy of the medicinal properties of cranberry products has been well-established.""

The review explains that the medicinal properties of cranberries may be attributed to their unique polyphenol, proanthocyanidins - or PACs, for short. Their ability to keep infection-causing bacteria from sticking to the urinary tract walls may be the major reason for their effectiveness in limiting infection growth and recurrence.

According to the authors, scientists and practitioners continue to explore the use of alternative therapies in the prevention of common infections as part of the global movement to reduce antibiotic use and resistance. It is estimated that one third of women in the United States will get a UTI by the age of 24.2

""Findings like this,"" adds Dr. Luis, ""give practitioners a viable, inexpensive, non-antibiotic option to help patients reduce the recurrence of an uncomfortable and potentially debilitating infection.""

""As one of the oldest alternative therapies and U.S.-born berries, independent research such as this not only provides public health benefits, it revitalizes the enthusiasm for cranberry products year-round. The industry appreciates the efforts of these researchers and takes pride in the healthy attributes that cranberry products provide to consumers around the world,"" comments Terry Humfeld, executive director of the non-profit research and education-focused organization, The Cranberry Institute.

"PHILADELPHIA - Sleep deprivation -- typically administered in controlled, inpatient settings -- rapidly reduces symptoms of depression in roughly half of depression patients, according the first meta-analysis on the subject in nearly 30 years, from researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Partial sleep deprivation (sleep for three to four hours followed by forced wakefulness for 20-21 hours) was equally as effective as total sleep deprivation (being deprived of sleep for 36 hours), and medication did not appear to significantly influence these results. The results are published today in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry.

Although total sleep deprivation or partial sleep deprivation can produce clinical improvement in depression symptoms within 24 hours, antidepressants are the most common treatment for depression. Such drugs typically take weeks or longer to experience results, yet 16.7 percent of 242 million U.S. adults filled one or more prescriptions for psychiatric drugs in 2013. The findings of this meta-analysis hope to provide relief for the estimated 16.1 million adults who experienced a major depressive episode in 2014.

Previous studies have shown rapid antidepressant effects from sleep deprivation for roughly 40-60 percent of individuals, yet this response rate has not been analyzed to obtain a more precise percentage since 1990 despite more than 75 studies since then on the subject.

""More than 30 years since the discovery of the antidepressant effects of sleep deprivation, we still do not have an effective grasp on precisely how effective the treatment is and how to achieve the best clinical results,"" said study senior author Philip Gehrman, PhD, an associate professor of Psychiatry and member of the Penn Sleep Center, who also treats patients at the Cpl. Michael J. Crescenz VA Medical Center. ""Our analysis precisely reports how effective sleep deprivation is and in which populations it should be administered.""

Reviewing more than 2,000 studies, the team pulled data from a final group of 66 studies executed over a 36 year period to determine how response may be affected by the type and timing of sleep deprivation performed (total vs early or late partial sleep deprivation), the clinical sample (having depressive or manic episodes, or a combination of both), medication status, and age and gender of the sample. They also explored how response to sleep deprivation may differ across studies according to how ""response"" is defined in each study.

""These studies in our analysis show that sleep deprivation is effective for many populations,"" said lead author Elaine Boland, PhD, a clinical associate and research psychologist at the Cpl. Michael J. Crescenz VA Medical Center. ""Regardless of how the response was quantified, how the sleep deprivation was delivered, or the type of depression the subject was experiencing, we found a nearly equivalent response rate.""

The authors note that further research is needed to identify precisely how sleep deprivation causes rapid and significant reductions in depression severity. Also, future studies are needed to include a more comprehensive assessment of potential predictors of treatment outcome to identify those patients most likely to benefit from sleep deprivation.

Globally, more than 50 million children are affected by acute malnutrition. Those with the most severe acute malnutrition have more than ten times increased mortality, and those surviving may have impaired development, compared to children without malnutrition. But this can be prevented if children are treated early, while they only have moderate acute malnutrition.

LNS supports healthy growth

Christian Fabiansen, MD PhD and a team from the Department of Nutrition, Sports and Exercise at the University of Copenhagen conducted the study in collaboration with a PhD-student from the Institut de Recherche en Sciences de la Santé in rural Northern Burkina Faso, where there was a high prevalence of acute malnutrition. Dr Fabiansen previously worked in humanitarian medical projects with Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), who also sponsored this work. The research was conducted in a malnutrition project run by the medical humanitarian organisation The Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) and its Burkinabe partners Keoogo and SOS Médecins.

During the trial, 1609 small children with moderate acute malnutrition were given either LNS or corn-soy porridge for 12 weeks. The study found that children who received LNS experienced greater weight gain, and the large majority of the weight gain was healthy lean tissue.

Dr Fabiansen , the main author of the paper appearing in PLOS Medicine today, underscores the importance of the findings:

""Previous studies of nutritional supplements have mainly looked at the effect on weight gain. It has been a concern that LNS, with its very high fat content, would result mainly in weight gain composed of fat. But by using a method based measurement of heavy water in the child's body we have found that LNS mainly increase lean mass, that is muscles and organs, which are important for immune function, survival and development.""

Novel standard for research in malnutrition may save lives

Professor Henrik Friis, the senior author on the paper, points to the importance of the collaboration between university researchers and humanitarian organizations:

""It has been a new way to conduct research, that we tested the effect of nutritional supplements used mainly by aid agencies, employing very advanced research methods in remote rural areas where humanitarian organization are working, and not at the university hospitals. The collaboration between researchers and humanitarian organizations means these findings can have immediate practical impact on field practice.""

The General Director of the Danish section of MSF Jesper H. Brix notes:

""Acute malnutrition is still a major global health problem. So, I hope we can use the results to provide the best possible treatment for more vulnerable children. If we can treat children with moderate acute malnutrition with the scientifically proven most effective food aid product, and thereby prevent severe acute malnutrition, then many lives can be saved""

Dr Susan Shepherd, a paediatrician who heads ALIMA's Operational and Clinical Research, says:

""ALIMA is very proud of its participation in this study. Vulnerable children, no matter where they live, deserve the best medical and nutritional treatments available. Studies like Treatfood generate the evidence we need to make the best decisions with our patients. ALIMA is committed to developing more research partnerships in its humanitarian projects, because this is how we will raise the quality of medical practice for all.""

Treatfood: treating acute malnutrition

University of Copenhagen, Doctors Without Borders and ALIMA have collaborated on the project Treatfood, which aims to improve products for children with acute malnutrition. The study was primarily funded by Danida, MSF-Denmark and MSF-Norway, and USAID via the World Food Programme.

The main Treatfood results are presented in the paper: Effectiveness of food supplements in increasing fat-free tissue accretion in children with moderate acute malnutrition: A randomised 2 × 2 × 3 factorial trial in Burkina Faso, published in the open access medical journal PLOS Medicine. Earlier peer-reviewed articles from the study have appeared in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, BMC Nutrition, and Appetite.

Facts about malnutrition

Malnutrition in children can be chronic or acute. In acute malnutrition children are thin relative to their height, or wasted. Approximately 8% or 50 mio children globally are affected by acute malnutrition. Of these, 2/3 have moderate and 1/3 severe acute malnutrition. Acute malnutrition is more life-threatening than chronic. In chronic malnutrition the children are short relative to their age, or stunted. More than 30% of children in the world have chronic malnutrition.

Previous research has focused on treatment of severe acute malnutrition. WHO has called for research to identify the most optimal foods for treatment of children with moderate acute malnutrition.

"EAST LANSING, Mich. - Michigan State University scientists now have early proof that an antidepressant drug that's been around for more than 50 years could slow the progression of Parkinson's.

In a proof-of-concept study, published in the journal Neurobiology of Disease, the drug nortriptyline, which has been used to treat depression and nerve pain, stopped the growth of abnormal proteins that can build up in the brain and lead to the development of the disease.

""Depression is a very frequent condition associated with Parkinson's, so we became interested in whether an antidepressant could modify how the disease progresses,"" said Tim Collier, lead author of the federally funded study and a neuroscientist at MSU.

Collier and collaborator Katrina Paumier, an assistant professor of molecular medicine, began looking at previous patient data to see if individuals who were on antidepressants experienced any delay in their need to go on a standard Parkinson's therapy called levodopa. This type of therapy increases levels of dopamine, a natural chemical in the body that sends signals to other nerve cells and can significantly decrease in cases of Parkinson's.

The medication also treats many of the symptoms associated with the disease such as tremors and poor muscle control.

""We found that those on a certain class of antidepressant, called tricyclics, didn't need the levodopa therapy until much later compared to those who weren't on that type of antidepressant medication,"" Collier said.

Collier then began testing rats with the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline and found that it indeed was able to decrease the amount of abnormal protein that can build up in the brain. This protein, known as alpha-synuclein, can cause the brain's nerve cells to die when in a clustered state and is a hallmark sign of the disease.

To further back up his research, he enlisted the help of his colleague and co-author Lisa Lapidus, who in previous studies had already detected whether certain compounds could bind to alpha-synuclein and stop it from accumulating.

""Proteins are constantly moving and changing shape,"" said Lapidus, a professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy. ""By using a test tube model, we found that by adding nortriptyline to the alpha-synuclein proteins, they began to move and change shape much faster, preventing the proteins from clumping together. The idea that this clustering effect is controlled by how fast or slow a protein reconfigures itself is typically not a standard way of thinking in research on proteins, but our work has been able to show these changes.""

Understanding how these proteins can clump together could point researchers in new directions and help them find other possible drugs that could potentially treat Parkinson's.

""What we've essentially shown is that an already FDA-approved drug that's been studied over 50 years and is relatively well tolerated could be a much simpler approach to treating the disease itself, not just the symptoms,"" Collier said.

Collier is already looking for funding for the next phase of his research and hopes to lead a human clinical trial using the drug in the future.

Longtime antidepressant could slow Parkinson's	2017-09-29 06:00:00	https://web.archive.org/web/20170906003011/https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-09/msu-lac090517.php	news_reviews_00174	fake
"For the first time, scientists have precisely identified and targeted an area of the brain which is involved in ""hearing voices"", experienced by many patients with schizophrenia. They have been able to show in a controlled trial that targeting this area with magnetic pulses can improve the condition in some patients. This early clinical work is presented at the ECNP conference in Paris on Tuesday 5th September, with later publication in Schizophrenia Bulletin*.

""This is the first controlled trial to precisely determine an anatomically defined brain area where high frequency magnetic pulses can improve the hearing of voices"", said lead researcher, Professor Sonia Dollfus (University of Caen, CHU, France).

Schizophrenia is a serious long-term mental health problem. People with schizophrenia experience a range of symptoms, which may include delusions, muddled thoughts and hallucinations. One of the best-known is hearing voices, also known as Auditory Verbal Hallucination (AVH), which around 70% of people with schizophrenia experience at some point. These voices, may be 'heard' as having a variety of different characteristics, for example as internal or external, friendly or threatening, they may be continuously present or present only occasionally, and so on.

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has been suggested as a possible way of treating the hearing of voices in schizophrenia. TMS uses magnetic pulses to the brain, and has been shown to be effective in several psychiatric conditions. However, there is a lack of controlled trials to show that TMS works effectively with AVH sufferers.

The French research team worked with 26 patients who received active TMS treatment, and 33 as a control group, who received sham (placebo) treatment. The researchers interviewed the patients using a standard protocol - the Auditory Hallucinations Rating Scale - which revealed most of the characteristic features of the voices which they were hearing. The treated patients received a series of 20 Hz high-frequency magnetic pulses over 2 sessions a day for 2 days. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the pulses were targeted at a specific brain area in the temporal lobe, which is associated with language (the exact area is the crossing of the projection of the ascending branch of the left lateral sulcus and the left superior temporal sulcus)

After 2 weeks, the patients were re-evaluated. The researchers found that 34.6% of the patients being treated by TMS showed a significant response, whereas only 9.1% of patients in the sham group responded ('significant response' was defined as a more than 30% decrease in the Total Auditory Hallucinations Rating Scale score).

Professor Sonia Dollfus said: ""Auditory Verbal Hallucinations, or ""hearing voices"" can be a disturbing symptom of schizophrenia, both for patients and for those close to sufferers. This is the first controlled trial to show an improvement in these patients by targeting a specific area of the brain and using high frequency TMS. This means two things; firstly it seems that we now can say with some certainty that we have found a specific anatomical area of the brain associated with auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia. Secondly, we have shown that treatment with high frequency TMS makes a difference to at least some sufferers, although there is a long way to go before we will know if TMS is the best route to treat these patients in the long-term"".

Commenting, Professor Andreas Meyer-Lindenberg, Central Institute of Mental Health, Mannheim and member of the ECNP executive board, said: ""This work builds on previous studies that have shown a critical role of excessive activity of subregions of the temporal lobe in the generation of voice hallucinations in schizophrenia. To move this into treatment, controlled trial such as the one by Dollfus and coworkers are important. While response rates were moderate, TMS is a welcome addition to the therapeutic repertoire especially for patients who do not respond to medication.""

"Research published today in Scientific Reports shows that light from RayVio's 293nm ultraviolet (UV) LED is more efficient than sunlight at producing vitamin D3 in skin samples. Tyler Kalajian and his research team, led by Dr. Michael F. Holick, Ph.D., M.D., and supported by Boston University School of Medicine and a Boston University Ignition Award, found that skin samples exposed to RayVio's UV LED for just 0.52 minutes produced more than twice as much vitamin D3 as samples exposed to 32.5 minutes of sunlight.

""We tested ultraviolet LEDs from different sources and at different wavelengths. RayVio's 293nm LED showed the most significant potential for vitamin D3 production in the shortest amount of time,"" said Dr. Holick, a Professor of Medicine, Physiology and Biophysics at Boston University School of Medicine, and endocrinologist at Boston Medical Center. ""This study will lead to a new generation of technology that can be labeled as photopharmacology in which the use of LEDs with targeted wavelengths can cause specific biologic effects in human skin to help treat and prevent chronic illnesses.""

Vitamin D deficiency is associated with osteoporosis, rickets and other metabolic bone diseases and is more prevalent in northern and southern latitudes where sunlight is limited for a significant part of the year. This device for making vitamin D is ideally suited for patients with fat malabsorption syndromes including inflammatory bowel disease and gastric bypass surgery.

The research shows that RayVio's UV LEDs could be used for treating patients that are vitamin D deficient. A vitamin D3 producing UV LED device could be used on skin areas that experience less exposure to sunlight such as upper legs and arms and abdomen and back thus minimizing risk for developing non-melanoma skin cancer. The UV LED device also emits a much narrower band of UVB light and thereby decreasing likelihood of skin damage that can occur when the skin is exposed to higher wavelengths of UV radiation.

""The potential of digital UV technology for phototherapy is enormous,"" said Dr. Robert C. Walker, RayVio's CEO. ""Dr. Holick's research with our UVB LEDs demonstrates the potential for new applications that can potentially improve and save hundreds of thousands of lives.

About Vitamin D3 Two forms of vitamin D are important to humans: vitamin D2 produced by plants, yeast and mushrooms, and vitamin D3 produced by skin when exposed to sunlight or the appropriate wavelength of ultraviolet light.

U.S. alone, seventy-five percent of teens and adults are vitamin D deficient. Thanks to the work of the research team and the pioneering work of the Boston University Photonics Center on UV LEDs, we may soon see innovative treatment options like simple integration with a wearable device could aid millions of people.""

"New Rochelle, NY, September 25, 2017--A phase 3 study of children ages 6-12 years with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has shown that a delayed-release, long-acting formulation of the stimulant methylphenidate, when taken in the evening, led to significant improvement in ADHD symptoms and functional impairment first thing the next morning, compared to a placebo. Children taking the delayed-release stimulant did not have to wait for a morning dose to take effect and also benefited from improved symptoms later in the afternoon and evening, according to the study results published in Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology, a peer-reviewed journal from Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers. The article is available free on the Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology website.

The article entitled ""Efficacy and Safety of HLD200, Delayed-Release and Extended-Release Methylphenidate, in Children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder"" is coauthored by Steven Pliszka, MD, from The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio and colleagues from Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA), Westside Medical Family Practice (Clinton, UT), University of Tennessee Health Science Center (Memphis, TN), Meridien Research (Maitland and Bradenton, FL), Children's Development Center (Winter Park, FL), Ironshore Pharmaceuticals & Development (Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands), and Mount Sinai Medical Center (New York, NY), on behalf of the HLD200-108 Study Group.

The drug formulation, which consists of two layers of microbeads with an inner drug-loaded core, delays release of the active ingredient for 8-10 hours and then provides controlled extended release designed to cover the early morning into the evening. The medication was well tolerated, with the main adverse effects of appetite suppression and insomnia being those commonly reported for other formulations of methylphenidate.

""Developing new formulations of effective medications for patients with ADHD improves the lives of children with the disorder,"" says Harold S. Koplewicz, MD, Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology and President of the Child Mind Institute in New York.

"For the first time, doctors have used gene therapy to stave off a fatal degenerative brain disease, an achievement that some experts had thought impossible.

The key to making the therapy work? One of medicine’s greatest villains: HIV.

The patients were children who had inherited a mutated gene causing a rare disorder, adrenoleukodystrophy, or ALD. Nerve cells in the brain die, and in a few short years, children lose the ability to walk or talk.

They become unable to eat without a feeding tube, to see, hear or think. They usually die within five years of diagnosis.

The disease strikes about one in 20,000 boys; symptoms first occur at an average age of 7. The only treatment is a bone-marrow transplant — if a compatible donor can be found — or a transplant with cord blood, if it was saved at birth."

"Cooling babies deprived of oxygen at birth (perinatal asphyxia) can reduce the number of children who develop epilepsy later in childhood, according to a new study published in the journal Epilepsia.

The study has been led by Marianne Thoresen, Professor of Neonatal Neuroscience, from the Bristol Medical School: Translational Health Sciences at the University of Bristol.

It is known that newborn babies who suffer perinatal asphyxia may develop permanent brain injury resulting in cerebral palsy or other conditions, like epilepsy. Until recently, 20 to 30 per cent of these patients would develop epilepsy and many need regular antiepileptic treatment. The patients' cognitive performance, life quality and life expectancy is also affected by having the condition.

The research team has developed and delivered cooling treatment, known as therapeutic hypothermia, for newborns who suffer lack of oxygen during birth. For up to eight years, the researchers followed 165 infants who were born in the south west and who received cooling therapy at St Michael's Hospital, Bristol, part of University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust. The study examined how many babies were diagnosed with epilepsy and how many are on regular antiepileptic drug treatment at two and four to eight years of age.

The research found that babies, born after 2007, who received the cooling treatment, had much less epilepsy than before cooling treatment was introduced. At two years, seven per cent of the children had an epilepsy diagnosis, however, far fewer, only two per cent, were on regular antiepileptic drugs.

The study showed that more children had epilepsy when they reached the age of four to eight years with seven per cent on regular medication. However, these are very low numbers needing antiepileptic treatment compared to before cooling treatment was introduced as standard of care.

Before therapeutic hypothermia was introduced, poor outcome meaning death or moderate or severe disability was around 66 per cent (32 per cent death and 34 per cent surviving with disability).

In this cohort born after 2007, the number of children with poor outcome is lower at 34 per cent (11 per cent death and 23 per cent survived with disability). Also, the severity of cerebral palsy is milder and seven out of ten are able to walk. Even if a lesser severity of perinatal asphyxia is accounted for, cooling therapy has increased the number of healthy survivors and there are very few children with epilepsy needing drug treatment.

Professor Marianne Thoresen said: ""Even if we account for a lesser severity of perinatal asphyxia, our research has shown that therapeutic hypothermia reduces the number of children who develop epilepsy later in childhood. Cooling treatment also reduces the number and severity of cerebral palsy and increases the number of patients who survive normally.""

HealthDay Reporter

MONDAY, Oct. 9, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Drinking plenty of water each day may have an unexpected benefit -- staving off urinary tract infections, a new study reports.

Young women plagued by UTIs who drank an additional 6 cups of water each day were nearly half -- 48 percent -- as likely as a control group to have another infection, the study showed.

The water group also reduced their use of antibiotics by roughly half -- or 47 percent.

What's more, the amount of time that passed before a woman's next UTI and between recurrent infections was longer in the water group than in the control group.

Women are more prone to UTIs than men, partly due to their anatomy. A shorter urethra makes it easier for bacteria from rectum to enter the vagina and travel to the bladder.

Study author Dr. Thomas Hooton said it's thought that increasing fluid intake decreases UTI risk in two ways: by preventing bacteria from adhering to the bladder and by reducing the overall concentration of bacteria that could cause an infection.

""Flushing bacteria out of the bladder, it's been known, at least it's been thought, that it is protective. This study suggests that it is,"" said Hooton, clinical director of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Miami School of Medicine.

Dr. Hunter Wessells, who wasn't involved in the study, called the additional fluid intake ""substantial,"" leading to a corresponding increase in urine output.

""It is the urine output which is of course the key factor leading to the effect seen in the study,"" said Wessells, chair of the department of urology at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle.

Dr. Susan Bleasdale, medical director of infection control at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said the study ""may be a game changer"" for antibiotic ""stewardship"" programs aimed at reducing inappropriate antibiotic use.

She cited a 2010 review estimating that 11 million to 12 million women a year will suffer from a UTI, accounting for 1.6 billion antibiotic prescriptions a year.

""We might not even need to use antibiotics,"" she said.

The study, conducted in Bulgaria, involved 140 healthy premenopausal women who had at least three UTIs in the past year. All reported low daily fluid intake. They drank roughly four cups of fluid per day, including just 2 cups of water a day.

Half of the women in the study were asked to consume 1.5 liters of water, or about 6 cups, each day in addition to their usual daily fluid intake. Specifically, they were asked to begin drinking a 1/2-liter water bottle at each meal and finish each bottle before the next meal.

The remaining women served as a control group. They continued their usual fluid intake.

The women were followed for a year, with clinic visits at the beginning of the study as well as 6 and 12 months later. Researchers measured their water and fluid intake; urine volume, frequency and concentration; and symptoms. They also called the women each month to assess compliance and counsel them to return to the clinic for evaluation and possible treatment if they were experiencing UTI symptoms.

Overall, the water group increased daily water intake by close to 5 cups a day. Their total daily fluid intake, including water and other beverages, averaged nearly 12 cups.

By contrast, the control group's total daily fluid intake was less than half of that.

Hooton noted that it's not clear exactly how much fluid intake must increase to deliver a benefit.

""There's no magic in a liter-and-a-half,"" he said.

Likewise, he believes any increase in fluid -- not just water -- may be beneficial since fluids are mostly water. And while the study involved younger women, he said older women who experience recurrent UTIs may benefit from increasing their daily fluid intake as well.

Whether the advice would benefit women with normal urine output, however, is unclear, Wessells noted.

""In addition, the bother associated with the higher urine output, and feasibility of implementing this water intake strategy across a range of occupations and ages, requires further study as well,"" he said.

Researchers presented the findings Saturday at IDWeek 2017, the annual meeting of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, the HIV Medicine Association and the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society.

Research presented at meetings is generally considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed publication.

"The first placebo-controlled study of two vaccines against the Ebola virus found they both successfully created a powerful antibody response for a year, suggesting they both could be tools to save lives in a future epidemic of the deadly disease.

The research, by doctors from the U.S. and Liberian governments and elsewhere, was published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study looked at 1,500 patients in Liberia, and took place amid and after the outbreak of Ebola in Liberia from 2014 into 2015.

Five hundred participants received a vaccine developed by Merck & Co., 500 got one from GlaxoSmithKline PLC, which was based on work by the National Institutes of Health, and 500 received a placebo.

With the Merck vaccine, at one month, 83.7% of patients had developed antibodies to Ebola virus, versus 70.8% with the Glaxo vaccine and a negligible number, 2.8%, in the placebo group. The relationship of antibody responses was similar after 12 months, with 79.5%, 63.5% and 6.8% of patients, respectively, showing antibody response.

There is a “reasonable chance that either of these vaccines would play a role in preventing infection,” said H. Clifford Lane, deputy director for clinical research at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a principal investigator in this study. NIAID is part of the National Institutes of Health. The Liberian Ministry of Health and other researchers also conducted the study.

The West African Ebola outbreak—the worst in recorded history—caused an estimated 11,000 deaths amid 25,582 cases in the three nations of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The hemorrhagic fever, which can be fatal in half or more cases, spread from West Africa to a handful of cases in Europe and the U.S., including among health care workers. The disease appears and disappears unpredictably in the African forests, and is widely believed to be spread by bats.

In Dr. Lane’s view, given previously existing positive evidence from a Guinea study of the Merck vaccine, if doctors in a future epidemic had to choose, it would probably be the one from Merck.

That Merck vaccine was shown to be “highly efficacious” during the Ebola epidemic in Guinea by World Health Organization doctors writing in The Lancet in December. But the methodology of that study—including the lack of a placebo group—raised questions among some scientists about how conclusive those findings were.

A detailed report by the prestigious National Academy of Medicine in April questioned the methodology of the Merck vaccine study in Guinea. It concluded the Merck vaccine “most likely provides some protection” to recipients but that the protection “could in reality be quite low.”

One of the authors of that Academy of Medicine report, vaccine specialist and pediatrics professor Kathryn M. Edwards of Vanderbilt University, said the new evidence shows “the safety of the two vaccines is comparable.” But she said any comparison of the two vaccines based on the antibody evidence “is a bit undecided” because it is unknown precisely what antibody levels are needed to protect patients.

Merck said the “safety and immunogenicity results observed” in this most recent research “are consistent with what we observed in other studies.” GSK said it is too early to know whether the immunity differences between the two vaccines “indicate a clinically meaningful difference.” The NIH/GSK vaccine was the focus of a page-one Wall Street Journal article about it and the NIH scientist, Nancy J. Sullivan, who developed it.

The two different studies arose through a kind of scientific war. Several British and other European medical groups, including some who funded the Guinea study of the Merck vaccine, had argued that giving any patients a placebo wasn’t ethical in the middle of a raging epidemic. But U.S. government doctors, including leaders of the NIH, said a placebo group was necessary to ensure patients truly got benefit, and weren’t harmed, from either a vaccine or a drug.

This current study, in Liberia, was designed to avoid those pitfalls through its classic placebo-controlled design. But it ran into another obstacle: Ebola cases in Liberia began to dwindle early in 2015, and the outbreak there was declared over on May 9 of that year. By the time this work was fully under way, it was too late to see if vaccines actually prevented Ebola sickness and death.

It still was possible, however, to measure patients’ immune-systems’ response, measured by how many produced significant antibodies to the Ebola virus. Also, vaccine safety could be assessed, and both vaccines appeared safe.

NIH scientists now are evaluating antibody levels out to two years.

The level of serious adverse events was higher in the placebo group than either vaccine group, and “most of the serious adverse events were attributed to malaria,” the researchers wrote.

THURSDAY, Oct. 12, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among women in the United States, and routine screenings remain the most reliable way to detect the disease early, a breast cancer expert says.

""Breast cancer can be treated more successfully if detected in its early phases, while it is small and has not yet spread,"" said Dr. Kathryn Evers, director of mammography at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. ""With today's state-of-the-art treatment options and less extensive surgery, patients are experiencing better outcomes.""

Older age is a leading risk factor for breast cancer. Most women are diagnosed after the age of 50. Having certain mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes also predispose women to the disease. And there are some lifestyle-related risk factors that can be controlled, such as hormone therapy after menopause, obesity, alcohol intake and physical inactivity, Evers said.

""Having one risk factor or even several doesn't mean a woman will definitely develop breast cancer,"" she said in a Fox Chase news release. ""Women need to become educated about the risk factors, especially those they can control, and then adjust their lifestyle accordingly.""

Not all women with breast cancer experience the same warning signs of the disease. Symptoms of breast cancer may include:

A lump in the breast or armpit.

Swelling or thickening in part of the breast.

Dimpling or irritation of the skin on the breast.

Pain in the breast that doesn't go away.

Redness or flaky skin on the breast or nipple.

Unusual nipple discharge.

A change in the size or shape of the breast.

In some cases, women never develop any of these symptoms, Evers noted.

""All women should know how their breasts look and feel so they can recognize any changes in them. This is an important part of breast health,"" she said. ""But just being familiar with your breasts should never take the place of regular screenings and mammograms. These tests can help find breast cancer in its early stages, even before symptoms appear.""

There are three tests often used to look for breast cancer, Evers said.

Mammogram: An X-ray of the breast used to examine breast changes. Its effectiveness depends on the size of a breast tumor and the density of breast tissue. Three-dimensional (3D) mammography involves X-ray machines that take pictures of thin slices of the breast from different angles, to build a 3D image.

""I advise women to speak with their physician to determine what is right for them,"" Evers said.

Breast Cancer Screenings Still Best for Early Detection	2017-10-12 00:00:00	https://consumer.healthday.com/cancer-information-5/breast-cancer-news-94/breast-cancer-screenings-still-best-for-early-detection-727145.html	story_reviews_00158	fake
"Characterized by the World Health Organization as a ""neglected tropical disease,"" leprosy (also known as Hansen's disease) is one of the most ancient diseases known to humankind and is caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium leprae. Nearly a quarter of a million people worldwide have leprosy, which causes disfiguration of the skin and mucous membranes as well as progressive and incurable nerve damage. While drug therapy exists for leprosy, it must be taken for many months, has many side effects and often is given too late to reverse the permanent damage caused by the bacterial infection. A viable vaccine to prevent and/or treat leprosy is the next step in the effort to bring this disease to an end.

Scientists at IDRI, along with national and international collaborators including the National Hansen's Disease Program and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, with financial support from American Leprosy Missions, have developed a promising leprosy vaccine candidate designed to help treat leprosy and prevent exposed individuals from developing disease and the resulting disabilities. Based on data generated in preclinical studies, the vaccine candidate, called LepVax, has progressed to Phase I clinical testing in the United States, the first stage of safety testing in human volunteers. The clinical trial is focused on safety, as well as evaluating the immune response to the vaccine.

""While previous attempts have used vaccines primarily developed for other diseases, this is the first totally defined vaccine candidate developed specifically for leprosy, using the latest technologies and offering no less than those exposed to leprosy deserve,"" said Steven Reed, Ph.D., IDRI President, CEO & Founder. ""The leprosy vaccine program at IDRI has benefited greatly from what we've learned in the development of tuberculosis vaccine candidates over the past two decades. Although the bacteria that cause tuberculosis and leprosy are related, leprosy vaccine development posed great challenges. This vaccine represents a unique accomplishment, requiring the most advanced technologies in molecular biology and immunology, and American Leprosy Missions has been there from the beginning."" IDRI scientists have also developed two vaccine candidates for tuberculosis, both in clinical stages of development.

""We are thrilled that after 15 years and an investment of over $5.1 million, made possible by our faithful donors and partners, a leprosy-specific vaccine is beginning a Phase I clinical trial,"" says Bill Simmons, President and CEO of American Leprosy Missions. ""We believe this may be the most exciting breakthrough in leprosy treatment since multi-drug therapy, the current treatment for leprosy, was launched in the 1980s. We look forward to this vaccine improving the health outcomes of people diagnosed with leprosy. And, it may be that this vaccine can lead to interruption of the transmission of leprosy all together. What a tremendous legacy this would leave for millions of people worldwide.""

The vaccine was developed through significant efforts in screening and identifying M. leprae proteins that trigger an effective immune response. IDRI scientists then produced a fusion of four leprosy proteins, which is combined with IDRI's proprietary immune-stimulating adjuvant (GLA-SE). With recent developments in vaccine technology, IDRI scientists can now induce protective responses even after infection, meaning it could be possible to prevent disease development in people already infected with the leprosy bacterium.

""This generation of a vaccine to prevent and possibly treat leprosy is the result of years of research. The development has been complicated by the fact that the organism that causes leprosy cannot be grown in culture in the laboratory,"" Reed explained. ""This is a unique example of a vaccine produced by totally synthetic methods.""

Reed added that, without the foresight and support of American Leprosy Missions, there would be no leprosy vaccine candidate. ""The vision and support of American Leprosy Missions has been tremendous as we've worked with them throughout the years, moving from our work in developing a leprosy diagnostic to our current focus on a successful leprosy vaccine,"" he said. ""The progress we've had to date would not have been possible without American Leprosy Missions' financial support and guidance."" Early results from the Phase I study should be available in 2018, and the partners are currently exploring mechanisms to advance the vaccine through later-phase clinical trials should results from the Phase I study (clinical trial NCT03302897) support further evaluation.

The vaccine candidate will serve as part of an overall strategy to end leprosy, which will require detection, prevention and treatment. IDRI had developed technology to enable a rapid, affordable, point-of-care diagnostic test, which was funded by NIAID (grant numbers 1R43AI066613-01A1 and 2R44AI066613-02.)

In addition to IDRI and American Leprosy Missions, a variety of partners are taking part in efforts to eliminate leprosy, including Novartis and the Novartis Foundation. Reed, along with scientists from a variety of scientific organizations recently published ""Innovative tools and approaches to end the transmission of Mycobacterium leprae"" in The Lancet Infectious Diseases , outlining what is needed to achieve this goal. Together with scientific, government and NGO partners, the Novartis Foundation develops and implements strategies to help interrupt leprosy transmission, while Novartis donates the treatment for leprosy free of charge.

"	Promising New Leprosy Vaccine Moves Into Human Trials	2017-10-12 08:30:00-04:00	http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/promising-new-leprosy-vaccine-moves-into-human-trials-300535487.html	news_reviews_00157	true
"Max, Rowan and Charlie Vertin’s muscles have been slowly collecting damage since the day they were born. Someday, they will not be able to walk. They will not be able to stand. Eventually, they will not be able to live. The brothers, ages 6 through 11, suffer from a debilitating and deadly genetic condition called Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).

Yet on September 28, Max, Rowan and Charlie Vertin got dressed up. In dark suits and blue shirts, with serious expressions on their round faces, they walked to stand next to their mother in a very beige room outside Washington, D.C. The people in that room, they believed, could change the course of their lives.

For years, the Vertin brothers have been participating in a clinical trial for a new medication called ataluren, intended to keep the progression of their disease at bay. By October 24, they’ll know if they will be able to keep taking that drug. That is the deadline for the Food and Drug Administration to make a choice. The agency could approve the drug, allowing the brothers and others like them to continue to take it. Or it could reject the drug for the third time and throw them into an uncertain future.

Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now

An FDA committee has already voted that data about the drug’s effectiveness was inconclusive. The agency’s final decision almost always echos the decisions of its committees. So, if this were any other kind of drug at any other time in FDA history, the FDA’s final answer would be a very predictable no.

If they do say no, the Vertins could lose access to the drug that has stabilized their condition. But there’s still a chance the FDA could approve the drug. Input from people affected by DMD may have convinced the agency once before to approve a drug for the condition despite iffy data. That is what the Vertins—and the company that produces the drug—are hoping will happen again.

Falling Behind

“It started out so innocent,” his mother, Betty Vertin, told Newsweek. Max was a big infant, born 10 lbs, 3 oz and nearly two feet long. “When he was missing milestones, I just thought it was because it was a big baby.” Even doctors assumed that he would eventually catch up. But when he started preschool, the difference between Max and other children became more obvious. “When other kids were running and jumping and climbing, Max wasn’t doing those things. He was just behind, physically.”

When Max was 4, in 2010, a genetic test confirmed that he had DMD. Betty had never heard of it. “Before we started living this life, I was clueless,” she said.

DMD is one of a class of similar genetic disorders. About 15 boys out of every 100,000 in the United States under 24 years old have DMD or a milder form, called Becker muscular dystrophy. (Most of the children affected are boys.) The illness affects the way their legs, heart, and lungs work.

Max’s diagnosis was devastating for Betty. “I feel like I walked into the room with a healthy four-year-old boy and I walked out with a child that was dying,” she said.

But the family’s struggles with DMD were just beginning. At the time, Rowan was 2, and Betty suspected that he also had the disease; she’d seen how her son struggled to stand up onto a stepstool in the bathroom to brush his teeth. She was also ten weeks pregnant with Charlie.

Genetic tests eventually confirmed both Rowan and Charlie also had DMD. Betty’s two daughters, Lexi, 16, and Mary, 2, as well as a fourth son, Chance, 10, do not.

“I felt like we had a year and a half of the same horrible diagnosis over and over and over again,” she said. “It was the hardest 18 months I’ve ever had and I hope I ever had.”

Still Walking

DMD always results in muscle weakness due to a lack of a protein called dystrophin. Some of the newest treatments for the condition try to fix that. One drug, which the FDA approved in 2016, works for people whose illness springs from a mutation in the gene that codes for dystrophin.

The drug, called Exondys 51 or eteplirsen, allows the genetic machinery that produces the protein to skip over the mutated part to make something that will work better. About 13 percent of people with DMD have this particular mutation, according to the FDA.

The Vertin brothers are not among them; the drug shouldn’t help them at all. So they tried ataluren. (The drug’s brand name is Translarna.) The company that produces ataluren, PTC Therapeutics, says that its drug forces cells to make the proteins in spite of a different kind of mutation called a nonsense mutation. Instead of having an error in the protein, the protein is accidentally cut short. This is the kind of mutation that three of Betty Vertin’s children have.

The Vertins have received the drug free through the clinical trial, and expenses for their trip from Nebraska to Washington, D.C. were paid by PTC Therapeutics.

Ataluren works by ordering a cell to use a slightly different piece to build the protein—as if someone spray-painted the word “don’t” on the molecular version of a stop sign. Exactly how it does that is still mysterious. A paper published by the company’s scientists in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Science said it probably affected the ribosome, a key part of how proteins are put together in a cell. (Researchers not affiliated with the company did not find the same kind of activity.)

Regardless of what mutation causes the illness, most people with DMD die in their 20s. Betty was told to expect her oldest son, Max, to be in a wheelchair full-time by the time he was 9 or 12.

Max is 11 now. His 12th birthday is in early November. He uses an electric mobility scooter for long distances, but he can still walk. He rides a bike without training wheels and without any modifications. He has a part in a school play and goes up and down stairs to get to the stage. He even plays a trumpet in his school’s band. “He’s got the lung capacity to blow that thing, very loudly,” Betty said.

For that, Betty credits ataluren, which Max started three years ago.

“His life is—it’s not like his peers, but he’s getting a lot of the experiences that his peers are having,” she said. “He’s living a sort of a typical sixth-grade life and that diagnosis—I didn’t know what it would look like for him. I didn’t expect it to look like this.”

But not everyone considers ataluren to be a miracle drug—with good reason. The clinical trial results haven't been great. Most of the company’s studies tested how fast a child could go about 30 feet or walk up and down stairs, or how far they could walk in six minutes. They did see some slight positive results, many of which came from a study done with the specific kind of patient the company discovered benefited most in a previous trial.

The FDA needs good data to make their decision, because when the agency approves a drug is sends a signal to the world. An approval is the FDA saying, “this drug is safe and effective. You could use it for your child, too.”

PTC Therapeutics has tried to get FDA approval for the drug twice before. Both times the agency refused to even consider the application. This time, the application for approval was filed over the FDA’s protest. (The drug has been conditionally approved in Europe.)

A Million Dollar Issue

Part of the reason that the drug has struggled is because of this requirement: if the drug is effective, the data should show it. But that hasn't happened consistently with ataluren. Many of the clinical trials failed to satisfy the statistical requirement to prove a drug works—at least not for the main outcome the company was looking at. Other, secondary measurements did seem to have good statistics. Certain groups of children seemed to have better results than others, too.

PTC Therapeutics founder and CEO Stuart Peltz says the statistics aren't a reason to reject the drug. Just because a drug doesn’t measure up in that way, he says, “doesn’t mean the drug is not effective.”

But even if the FDA agrees to overlook some of the negative data about ataluren, insurers may not. That could be a million-dollar issue for the families with affected children.

“If the evidence isn’t good, then insurance companies won’t pay for [drugs],” said National Center for Health Research (NCHR) president Diana Zuckerman. Two recently approved drugs have run into this problem: Spinraza, a drug for spinal muscular atrophy, and Exondys 51. Both drugs cost hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. Pharmaceutical companies traditionally will not discuss prices before drugs are approved; that said, ataluren costs about £220,000 in Britain. During clinical trials, participants like the Vertins normally do not pay for the treatment.

The NCHR also presented at the FDA meeting in September to discuss ataluren, urging the agency to not approve the drug without more research. The organization’s statement also raised concerns about side effects associated with the drug, specifically about the chance that it raises blood pressure and cholesterol levels in children. The company says these shifts are small and ""not clinically significant.""

In an e-mailed statement, FDA spokesperson Sandy Walsh confirmed that the FDA’s decisions are all “based on an assessment of the available data and whether the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks.” That data can include the experience of patients like Max, Rowan and Charlie.

Courtesy of Betty Vertin via Facebook

To Betty, the benefits are clear, even if they aren’t easily quantified. Rowan’s gait seems better. Max still doesn’t need to use a wheelchair all the time, bucking the prediction she heard when he was first diagnosed.

However, financial analysts who track the biotech sector are not optimistic about ataluren’s immediate prospects. Matthew Eckler, a senior biotechnology analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said that analysts and investors are betting the FDA will not approve the drug.

The FDA hasn’t said no yet. The agency still has nearly two more weeks to make a decision. Until then, Betty and her sons are living with a lot of uncertainty. “I’m really scared that my boys will have to go off [ataluren],” she said. Will they have access to the drug if it’s rejected? Would their conditions deteriorate if they didn’t? What other options do they have?

Betty has no good answers. She is hoping she won’t need to come up with them.

“DMD is a progressive disease, and my boys are stable,” Vertin said. “If we can just have a few more years with our boys or buy some time until there is a cure out there, that’s huge.”

SaveSave"	Muscular Dystrophy: Heartbroken Family Awaits FDA Decision on Experimental Drug	2017-10-14 12:50:02	https://web.archive.org/web/20171014122445/http://www.newsweek.com/muscular-dystrophy-heartbroken-family-awaits-fda-decision-experimental-drug-681835	story_reviews_00156	true
"The one-time infusion, known as CAR T-cell therapy, is made by Kite Pharma, which is based in Santa Monica, Calif., and recently was bought by Gilead Sciences for $11.9 billion. Kite announced Wednesday that the treatment's brand name will be Yescarta and its price will be $373,000.

AD

In late August, the FDA cleared the first CAR T-cell therapy, which is designed for children and young adults whose leukemia doesn't respond to standard treatments. About 600 patients in the United States fall into that category every year. Kymriah, which costs $475,000, is manufactured by Novartis.

AD

Biotech analysts had expected the Kite price to be lower than Kymriah's, in part because the number of eligible patients is larger and the response rates are lower. Even so, Yescarta's cost is likely to stoke the ongoing debate about high drug prices.

The FDA approval is the latest step forward for the fast-moving field of immunotherapy, which aims to bolster the immune system to attack malignancies. CAR T-cell therapies are among several approaches, along with treatments called checkpoint inhibitors and cancer vaccines, but they have recently grabbed much of the attention. Dozens of other companies also are working on them.

AD

“Today, marks another milestone in the development of a whole new scientific paradigm for the treatment of serious diseases,” FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement, adding that the approval demonstrates “the continued momentum of this promising new area of medicine.”

AD

A CAR T-cell therapy involves a complicated and customized procedure in which T cells — sometimes called the foot soldiers of the immune system — are removed from the patient. They are sent to a special lab and genetically modified to target a protein on the surface of the patient's cancer cells. Once the modified cells are returned to the patient, their numbers expand exponentially as they become an army of cancer fighters.

In 2015, Marie Miceli was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma at Siteman Cancer Center in St. Louis, which is jointly owned by Barnes-Jewish Hospital and Washington University School of Medicine. She received chemo and underwent a bone-marrow transplant. Neither worked.

AD

“The doctors were saying, 'Go see an attorney and get your life in order,' "" the 64-year-old Realtor recalled. Then they offered her a slot in Kite's clinical trial, a last-resort effort. “I could feel it when they put those T cells back in,” she said. “It was the craziest feeling in the world.” When she was checked a month later, she said, her cancer was gone. It hasn't returned.

AD

Kite's “vein-to-vein” turnaround period — from cell extraction to reinfusion — is about 17 days, according to Frederick Locke, an oncologist at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa and co-leader of the Kite trial.

The FDA said the safety and efficacy of Yescarta were established in a multi-center trial of more than 100 adults with large B-cell lymphoma. An independent review committee found that 72 percent of patients treated with a single infusion responded to therapy, including 51 percent who then showed no evidence of remaining cancer. Kite has said that at six months, 44 percent of patients were still responding, with 39 percent having no sign of cancer.

AD

“This is not just an incremental benefit,” said David Chang, Kite's chief medical officer. “It raises the potential that a cure can be possible.” Some of the first patients who underwent treatment now have been in remission for three to five years, he said, although he cautioned that it's still too early to know whether those patients are cured.

AD

Locke said about 13 percent of patients in the trial had a severe side effect known as cytokine release syndrome, which produces high fevers, low blood pressure and other flulike symptoms. Twenty-eight percent had neurological “events,” such as severe confusion; three patients died of complications caused by the treatment.

“These are patients who knew they were out of options,” he said, noting that lymphoma patients who relapse or don't respond to treatment have just a 50 percent chance of surviving for six months.

AD

Because of the side effects, the treatment will carry a boxed warning, the FDA's most serious. In addition, the agency is requiring hospitals and clinics that dispense Yescarta to be certified after undergoing special training.

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in adults. This type of cancer begins in the immune system and can be fast- or slow-growing, the FDA noted.

AD

Kite's CAR T-cell product was developed years ago at the National Cancer Institute by pioneering scientist Steven Rosenberg and licensed to the company for commercialization.

Armin Ghobadi, an oncologist at Siteman who was an investigator in the Kite trial, said the new treatment is “just the first step” and that researchers are working to make it safer and more effective. He said the therapy already has been life-changing for many of his patients — and for him.

“There's nothing worse than telling patients, 'I'm sorry, we are done here, we don't have anything else to offer,' "" he said.

"PHOENIX, Oct. 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Creative Medical Technology Holdings (OTCQB – CELZ) announced today completion of the safety data analysis on 20 patients with pharmacologically-resistant erectile dysfunction treated with the Company's patented CaverStem™ procedure.

The trial, sponsored by Creative Medical Technology Holdings, was conducted at the University of California Los Angeles Harbor Hospital/LA Biomed under Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval. An independent medical safety monitor was also appointed to review the patient data for safety and feasibility of administering bone marrow derived stem cells into patients with erectile dysfunction. The goal of this procedure is to regenerate blood vessels and smooth muscle, parts of the penis that are not functioning properly in this patient population.

""Based on establishment of safety of the CaverStem™ procedure in a formal university-based clinical trial, and independent confirmation of efficacy in an European clinical trial1, we have launched commercialization for the CaverStem™ procedure,"" said Timothy Warbington, President and Chief Executive Officer of Creative Medical Technology Holdings. ""Amongst other top urologists, we have recruited a world-renowned urologist as a lead physician to roll-out the procedure. We anticipate that the procedure will be available to patients that meet the eligibility criteria within the next 60 days.""

According to the National Institutes of Health, approximately 30 million men in the United States suffer from Erectile Dysfunction2, of which 9 million do not respond to pharmacological treatments such as Viagra, Levitra and Cialis.

""The CaverStem™ procedure involves obtaining a small amount of bone marrow from the patient, purifying the stem cells using a closed system device that is FDA cleared, and then administering these cells in the same procedure into the patient's penis,"" said Thomas Ichim, Ph.D, Chief Scientific Officer and Co-Founder of the Company. ""Having published the first peer-reviewed paper on this procedure back in 2013 together with internationally renowned urologists and stem cell experts3, it is very exciting for me to watch this translate from bench to bedside.""

"The first oral treatment for women with the common condition of uterine fibroids could be available as soon as summer 2018, with two other medications in the pipeline.

The drugs, experts say, would provide a new treatment option for a condition most commonly treated with a hysterectomy, or removal of the uterus.

“For the longest time we have not really had good options from an oral medication standpoint to treat fibroids,” says Arnold Advincula, vice chairman of women’s health and chief of gynecology at Sloane Hospital for Women at NewYork-Presbysterian/Columbia University Medical Center. “It’s nice to have some additional tools in the toolbox.”

Earlier in October the U.S. Food and Drug Administration accepted Allergan’s new drug application for ulipristal acetate (UA) to treat abnormal uterine bleeding caused by uterine fibroids. The company expects a decision by May.

The drug has been available in Europe and Canada for several years.

Two other oral medications indicated to treat uterine fibroids are also in development. Bayer launched a phase 3 clinical trial—usually the final trial used by regulators to decide whether to approve a drug—for a similar drug, vilaprisan, in the summer. And AbbeVie is in the midst of phase 3 trials for elagolix to treat uterine fibroids and endometriosis, a disorder in which the tissue that lines the inside of the uterus grows outside of it, causing pelvic pain. The company hopes to have a product available by 2020.

Uterine fibroids are benign tumors that grow in and around the uterus. It’s estimated that as many as 26 million women in the U.S. have one or more such tumors, though less than half experience symptoms. The most common symptom is long and excessive bleeding during menstrual periods, which can lead to anemia and the need for blood transfusions. Other symptoms can include pelvic pain or pressure, a swollen abdomen and frequent urination. Fibroids can also cause fertility and pregnancy problems, depending on their size and location.

The cause of fibroids remains unknown, though those with a family history have an increased risk of developing them. Dietary factors may also play a role. African-American women have a higher rate of uterine fibroids. If a woman has no symptoms, treatment of fibroids isn’t necessary, experts say.

While a hysterectomy is the most common way to treat fibroid tumors, women who still want to have children can have a myomectomy. That surgery removes fibroids while keeping the uterus intact. But fibroids can grow back after the procedure. A number of other minimally invasive procedures are less commonly used and usually not recommended for women who want to have children. There’s some chance of recurrence with most of them.

UA belongs to a group of drugs called selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRM). They block the progesterone from feeding the fibroids, which causes them to shrink.

“This particular drug also works directly on the lining of the uterus—the endometrium—so it also quite fast and dramatically decreases and stops the vaginal bleeding,” says Ayman Al-Hendy, director of interdisciplinary translational research at Augusta University in Georgia and a member of Allergan’s advisory board. Bleeding is reduced within five to six days, he says. Headaches and hot flashes were the most common side effects in the trials with UA, affecting less than 10% of women.

Patients take the once-a-day pill for three months and then stop for one menstrual cycle to allow the endometrium to shed, since the medication makes it grow thicker. Dr. Al-Hendy says the changes to the endometrium don’t raise the risk of endometrial cancer, which some have raised as a concern.

Patients with the condition say it’s time for better treatments.

Tanika Gray Valbrun, a 39-year-old network news producer in Atlanta, says she welcomes less invasive treatments that don’t affect fertility. She started the White Dress Project, a nonprofit patient advocacy group for women with uterine fibroids, in 2014.

She was diagnosed with fibroids at 19. She has suffered from pelvic pain, abdominal bloating that has resulted in people mistakenly thinking she’s pregnant and extremely heavy bleeding that has left her anemic.

“I’ve had five blood transfusions because of the amount of blood I’ve lost,” she says.

She has tried different types of birth control, but none helped with her symptoms. In 2013 she had a myomectomy and doctors removed 27 fibroids, keeping her out of work for nine weeks. Four years later, the fibroids are back.

Vanessa Jacoby, an associate professor in the department of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at University of California, San Francisco, conducts research in new fibroid treatments.

She says UA appears to have fewer side effects than Lupron, the only medication, an injectable, available in the U.S. that shrinks fibroids. Lupron effectively puts women into early menopause, which can result in hot flashes and bone loss. Women often must take it with hormone replacement therapy. It is usually used in preparation for surgery to shrink fibroids and maintain blood reserves.

While the company has done studies of women taking the drug up to a year, some experts believe the long-term health profile of a drug needs to be evaluated up to seven years, Dr. Jacoby says.

Shao-Lee Lin, vice president of therapeutic areas and international development at AbbVie, says the company is testing a twice daily dosing of elagolix. It is also studying including low-dose hormone therapy within elagolix to help maintain bone health.

Like Lupron, elagolix decreases sex hormones that cause fibroids to grow. What makes it different is it’s fast-acting and easier to reverse the effects if you stop taking it.

Studies have found it significantly reduces heavy menstrual bleeding and decreases the thickness of the endometrium by six months. It also decreases the size of fibroids.

"(Reuters Health) - Brain surgery for children whose epilepsy is resistant to drug therapy can produce a 10-fold increase in the odds of being seizure-free after one year and can do it without affecting IQ, according to a new Indian study of 116 patients in The New England Journal of Medicine.

Seventy-seven percent of the children were free of seizures at one year after the surgery, compared with seven percent in a control group of youngsters who received medical therapy alone while waiting for surgery. Behavior and quality of life also improved.

But surgery also produced serious adverse effects in one-third of the children, most frequently a weakness on one side of the body, known as hemiparesis. The researchers said that was to be expected and, without surgery, patients probably would have experienced similar problems as a result of their continuing seizures.

“What the study clearly shows is surgery for children produces seizure freedom compared to children not operated on for similar conditions,” senior author Dr. Manjari Tripathi, a professor of neurology and epilepsy at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi, told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.

Not only “does it reassure us that several surgical procedures are effective,” she said, it demonstrates that surgery “should be done as early as possible” once it becomes clear that a child is not responding to two anti-seizure medications.

About 50 million people worldwide suffer with epilepsy and drugs can’t control the seizures in approximately 30 percent of the cases.

“This is the first randomized study to look at surgical outcome in children,” said Dr. Donald Schomer, director of the Comprehensive Epilepsy Program at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. He was not involved in the research.

“The results are impressive,” he told Reuters Health by phone. Adults who undergo surgery often suffer from the collective effect of years of uncontrolled seizures. “The study in kids shows if you reduce the time from the onset of seizures from the 15 to 20 years you see in adults down to four to five years, the outcome is much better. It’s documentation that these techniques really work.”

Although 77 percent were judged by the Tripathi team to be seizure-free at the end of the study, some of those children actually had seizures immediately after surgery. Yet the cases were judged to be a success because the seizures decreased in frequency over time. Ultimately, 37 percent never had a seizure in the year after surgery.

When all seizures were taken into account, children who did not have surgery were four times more likely to have a seizure during that year than youngsters in the surgery group, the researchers calculated.

Success rates ranged from 87 percent to 100 percent depending on the type of surgery used to correct the child’s particular brain abnormality.

Surgery improved quality of life and social well-being, and it didn’t affect IQ, something that can decline with ongoing seizures. But Dr. Schomer said the children were only followed for one year, and “that may be too soon to see a noticeable change” in the intelligence quotient.

Post-surgery weakness was seen in 15 of the 19 patients who had a serious side effect following surgery.

The weakness “is significant,” Dr. Tripathi said. “The child may not be able to ambulate by his- or herself. But with physical therapy, all regain the lower and upper limb function within six months. The only thing that does not improve is the wrist and the fingers. They are left with this minor deficit. But even before surgery, some of them have this weakness.”

Other side effects depended on the area of the brain that was removed or disconnected from the rest of the brain.

In contrast, 16.5 percent of the children waiting for surgery had a serious injury as a result of their continuing seizures.

The surgery “had a transforming effect on how they get along in life,” Dr. Tripathi said. “Many could go back school earlier or go back to being tutored, and get on with their life.”

But a major problem facing these children is getting insurance companies to pay for such surgeries, said Dr. Schomer of Beth Israel.

Rather than pay $35,000 to $50,000 on surgery that might cure the problem and prevent further damage to the child, insurance companies prefer to demand that more drugs be tried, even if the odds of them working in drug-resistant cases is small, he said.

“Studies like this lend credence to the idea that the earlier you do it, the better the outcome,” he said. “I hope insurance companies will look at this and realize that early detection and surgery, if appropriate, will ultimately save them money in the long term.”

First test of anti-epilepsy surgeries in children shows dramatic benefit	2017-10-25 23:23:02	http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-epilepsy-kids-surgery/first-test-of-anti-epilepsy-surgeries-in-children-shows-dramatic-benefit-idUSKBN1CU33K	story_reviews_00150	true
"The results of dozens of scientific studies into the effects of smoking on the lungs are conclusive: Cigarette smoking is the No. 1 risk factor for developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. COPD is, as the name suggests, a chronic lung disease that makes it progressively harder to breathe. Although patients currently have several treatment options available to help manage the disease – whose name is an umbrella term encompassing both emphysema and chronic bronchitis – there is no cure.

Although it's clear that exposure to cigarette smoke is a major cause of COPD, it's not the only cause and scientists still aren't sure exactly how cigarette smoke and other inhaled irritants can trigger the development of COPD. One working theory is that smoking cigarettes depletes the body of vitamin A, a nutrient that the lungs use to repair themselves.

The National Institutes of Health reports that ""Vitamin A is the name of a group of fat-soluble retinoids, including retinol, retinal and retinyl esters."" It's involved in maintaining the immune system, vision, reproduction and communication between cells. ""Vitamin A also supports cell growth and differentiation, playing a critical role in the normal formation and maintenance of the heart, lungs, kidneys and other organs.""

Vitamin A enters the discussion with COPD because the body uses vitamin A to build and repair lung tissue. Dr. Antonello Punturieri, program director for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/environment at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, says the connection between vitamin A and the lungs starts from the very beginning, while we're developing in utero and continues well into adulthood. ""The lungs are still developing until age 25 or 30. This is why teen smoking is so bad,"" he says. Having an adequate vitamin A intake throughout this developmental period is critical to developing and maintaining strong, healthy lungs, he says.

But if our lungs don't have enough vitamin A to build or repair themselves, that could potentially lead to lung infections or chronic diseases of the lungs. A 2003 study in the journal Molecular Aspects of Medicine explains that ""during moderate vitamin-A-deficiency, the incidence for diseases of the respiratory tract is considerably increased and repeated respiratory infections can be influenced therapeutically by a moderate vitamin-A-supplementation. In addition to the importance of the vitamin for the lung function, vitamin-A is also responsible for the development of many tissues and cells as well as for the embryonic lung development.""

Another study conducted in Nepal and published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2010 also found that pregnant women who'd taken vitamin A supplements during pregnancy had children with better lung health when the researchers followed up 9 to 13 years later. ""Early interventions involving vitamin A supplementation in communities where undernutrition is highly prevalent may have long-lasting consequences for lung health,"" the authors concluded.

So it seems clear that vitamin A plays a role in lung health. To further investigate this connection, researchers in Holland bred laboratory mice to have reduced, but not deficient, levels of vitamin A. In their 2011 study, published in the Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology, the researchers then exposed these mice to cigarette smoke and observed that the mice developed emphysema in just three months. Although the study was done in mice and human physiology is different, there could be some implications here for the interaction of cigarette smoke, vitamin A levels and the development of chronic lung diseases.

One of these hoped-for implications is a way to reverse or cure the lung damage that results in COPD. Way back in 1997, researchers at the Georgetown University School of Medicine showed that retinoic acid, a derivative of vitamin A, reversed emphysema in the lungs of lab rats. The treatment restored lung alveoli – the small air sacs in the lungs that move oxygen and carbon dioxide into and out of the blood – to normal size and number. These spaces tend to become overinflated in patients with emphysema, so the results of that particular study were encouraging in advancing the idea of using vitamin A as a possible treatment for emphysema and COPD. But in a press release from the NHLBI, study co-author Dr. Donald Massaro urged caution. ""A great deal more basic research is needed before we can even begin to think about applying this to humans. Until then, we caution that there is absolutely no evidence that Vitamin A supplementation is useful in treating lung disorders."" Investigations continue, but currently there's still not enough evidence to support the idea that supplementing your diet with vitamin A is going to have a big impact on COPD symptoms or the progression of the disease.

Still, it's an important micronutrient that you should seek to include in your diet. Although most Americans are not deficient in vitamin A – the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that less than 1 percent of the population is deficient in vitamin A – the Mayo Clinic currently recommends that adult men 18 years and older should seek to take in 900 micrograms (3,000 international units) of vitamin A daily. Women age 18 and older should aim for 700 micrograms (2,300 IU) daily. Pregnant and nursing woman may need more vitamin A.

Vitamin A can be found in most multivitamins and in dairy products, liver, fortified foods, fish and darkly colored fruits and vegetables. ""Five servings of fruits and vegetables daily supplies 5 to 6 milligrams of provitamin A carotenoids, which provides about 50 to 65 percent of the adult recommend dietary allowance for vitamin A,"" the Mayo Clinic reports."

"October 26, 2017 - For younger patients with severe damage to the rotator cuff muscles, a ""reverse"" shoulder replacement provides lasting improvement in shoulder function, according to a study in The Journal of Bone & Joint Surgery. The journal is published in partnership with Wolters Kluwer.

""In the absence of treatment alternatives, reverse total shoulder arthroplasty [RTSA] is a justifiable treatment for patients with a massive, irreparable rotator cuff tear before the age of 60,"" according to the report by Christian Gerber, MD, of the University of Zurich and colleagues. Despite a substantial risk of complications, most patients are satisfied with the outcomes of RTSA at follow-ups of a decade or longer.

Stable Long-Term Results of RTSA in Patients Younger than 60

The researchers analyzed the long-term outcomes of RTSA in 20 patients, average age 57 years. All had ""massive, irreparable"" tears of the rotator cuff muscles, causing shoulder ""pseudoparalysis,""with little no ability to lift the arm.

This group of patients typically gets limited benefit from shoulder replacement with conventional implants, which rely on the rotator cuff muscles to provide shoulder movement. The RTSA technique--using an implant in which the natural locations of the shoulder ""ball and socket"" are reversed--uses other muscles to move the shoulder, providing an alternative when the rotator cuff is severely damaged or destroyed.

When first introduced, RTSA was performed mainly in elderly patients who placed low demands on the shoulder. With refinements in technique and components in more recent years, the procedure has been used in younger, more active patients. But there are concerns about how well the results of RTSA will hold up over time in this group of patients.

The new study focused on long-term outcomes of RTSA in patients under age 60. The patients underwent follow-up examination between eight and 19 years after surgery (average 11.7 years). Three patients had RTSA in both shoulders, for a total of 23 procedures.

Compared to their preoperative status, most patients had substantial long-term improvement after RTSA. The average Constant score--a standard assessment accounting for shoulder motion, strength, daily activities, and pain--at the time of final-follow-up improved from 24 to 59 (out of a possible 100).

Patients' ratings of ""subjective shoulder value"" improved from 20 percent to 71 percent (compared to 100 percent for a normal shoulder). Shoulder movement and strength increased, while pain decreased. The improvement was similar for patients with and without prior shoulder surgery.

However, complications occurred in 39 percent of the shoulders. Further surgery was required in six shoulders; in two cases, the RTSA procedure was considered a failure.

When complications occurred, long-term shoulder functioning was not as good but even with the high complication rate, 72 percent of patients rated their satisfaction level as excellent or good.

The results alleviate concerns that the clinical benefits of RTSA might not hold up over time in younger, more active patients. Despite its high complication rate, Dr. Gerber and colleagues conclude that RTSA ""provides substantial and lasting improvement"" in shoulder function and pain, in a group of patients with limited treatment options.

Good long-term improvement after 'reverse' shoulder replacement in patients under 60	2017-10-29 05:00:00	https://web.archive.org/web/20171026212801/https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-10/wkh-gli102617.php	news_reviews_00152	true
"Widely available ibuprofen is a better choice for pain relief in children who have undergone minor orthopedic outpatient surgery, as it has fewer adverse effects compared with oral morphine, according to results from a clinical trial published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal).

""This result suggests that adequate pain management should be an important goal of care, even after minor outpatient surgery, and that more effective pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies should be explored,"" writes Dr. Naveen Poonai, Clinician Scientist, Lawson Health Research Institute, and Associate Professor, Emergency Medicine, Department of Paediatrics, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, Western University, with coauthors.

The study included 154 children aged 5 to 17 years who underwent minor orthopedic surgery, such as keyhole surgery on joints, ligament and tendon repair, suture or hardware removal at London Health Sciences Centre in London, Ontario.

In the first 24 hours, more than 80% of the children in the study needed pain relief at home. Pain scores for children in both the oral morphine and ibuprofen groups were similar, but the children receiving oral morphine reported more adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, dizziness and constipation.

""Morphine did not provide superior analgesia, but was associated with significantly more adverse effects, making ibuprofen a better analgesic option,"" write the authors.

They note that as neither treatment completely relieved pain, more research is needed into effective pain relief, especially for more severe pain.

Oral morphine use at home has not been previously studied in children who have had minor surgery nor has it been compared with ibuprofen.

"In a remarkably rapid translation of laboratory research findings into a treatment with the potential to benefit patients, UC San Francisco scientists have successfully completed a Phase II clinical trial showing that an FDA-approved antihistamine restores nervous system function in patients with chronic multiple sclerosis (MS).

In light of previous laboratory studies of the antihistamine compound at UCSF, the researchers said, the drug most likely exerted its effect by repairing damage MS had inflicted on myelin, an insulating membrane that speeds transmission of electrical signals in the nervous system.

The drug tested in the trial, clemastine fumarate, was first identified as a candidate treatment for MS in 2013 by UCSF's Jonah R. Chan, PhD, Debbie and Andy Rachleff Distinguished Professor of Neurology, vice chief of the Division of Neuroinflammation and Glial Biology, and senior author of the new study. First approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1977 for allergies, the drug has been available over the counter in generic form since 1993.

The researchers said that the Phase II results, published online on 10 October, 2017 in The Lancet, are the first in which a drug has been shown to reliably restore any brain function damaged by a neurological disease in human patients.

""To the best of our knowledge this is the first time a therapy has been able to reverse deficits caused by MS. It's not a cure, but it's a first step towards restoring brain function to the millions who are affected by this chronic, debilitating disease,"" said the trial's principal investigator, Ari Green, MD, also Debbie and Andy Rachleff Distinguished Professor of Neurology, chief of the Division of Neuroinflammation and Glial Biology, and medical director of the UCSF Multiple Sclerosis and Neuroinflammation Center.

Chan and Green are co-directors of the UCSF Small-Molecule Program for Remyelination, and both are members of the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences.

The new results are particularly notable, Chan said, because patients in the trial had suffered from MS symptoms caused by injury to myelin for years. ""People thought we were absolutely crazy to launch this trial, because they thought that only in newly diagnosed cases could a drug like this be effective -- intuitively, if myelin damage is new, the chance of repair is strong. In the patients in our trial the disease had gone on for years, but we still saw strong evidence of repair.""

MS is an autoimmune neurodegenerative disorder that affects nearly 2.5 million people worldwide. The disease strikes when the immune system attacks myelin, layers of fatty insulating membrane that surround nerve fibers. Unlike the rubber insulation around wires, however, myelin helps electrical signals in neurons move faster and more efficiently. As myelin damage continues over the course of the disease, neurons progressively lose their ability to reliably transmit electrical signals, resulting in progressive loss of vision, weakness, walking difficulties, and problems with coordination and balance.

Current MS treatments aim to prevent the immune system from doing further harm, but none have been shown to repair damaged myelin. In both his 2013 research and in subsequent studies with a mouse model of MS, however, Chan and colleagues had demonstrated that clemastine fumarate promotes myelin regeneration and restores neural function, promising preclinical results that inspired the new study, known as the ReBUILD trial.

Because the visual system is often one of the first and most prominent parts of the brain to be affected in MS, and because there are well-established tools to measure the speed of neural transmission in the areas of the brain devoted to vision, the research team used a method known as visual evoked potentials, or VEPs, to assess clemastine's therapeutic effects in the trial.

The five-month Phase II trial enrolled 50 patients with relapsing but generally long-standing MS whose VEPs reflected preexisting deficits in neural transmission. The researchers showed flickering patterns on a screen to participants, and used electrodes placed over the brain's visual areas at the back of the head to gauge how long it took for the flickering signal presented to the eye to generate an electrical response that could be detected by the electrodes. The time from presentation of the pattern to the detection of the VEP is a measurement of how long it took for the signal to travel via nerve fibers from the retina, at the back of the eye, to the visual areas at the back of the brain.

To enhance the power of their study, the researchers used a ""crossover"" design: they divided the patient population in two and gave the drug, blinded to both participant and researcher, to one group, and a placebo to the other for 90 days; then they switched between the two groups, giving a placebo to the first group and the drug to the other for the next 60 days. This ""flip-flop"" technique gave the researchers the ability to compare patients to themselves -- a form of control that increased the statistical power of the study by nearly an order of magnitude, Green said.

During the periods when each group was taking the drug, the neural signal from the eye to the back of the brain was significantly accelerated over the baseline measurements taken before the patients began the study. The effect persisted in the group that had switched to placebo, suggesting that durable repair of myelin had been induced by the drug.

Although the research team could not directly observe evidence of rebuilding of myelin in trial participants using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Chan and Green said that this reflects a weakness of current MRI techniques as a tool for this purpose rather than evidence that myelin regeneration did not take place. ""We still don't have imaging methods that have been proven to be able to detect remyelination in humans,"" said Chan.

That myelin increases the speed of neural transmission is one of the most well-established concepts in neurobiology, and combined with the clear evidence from Chan's preclinical research showing that clemastine fumarate promotes myelin formation, myelin regeneration is the only plausible explanation for the VEP results, the authors said.

""This is the first step in a long process,"" Green said. ""By no means do we want to suggest that this is a cure-all. We want to ground-truth myelination metrics -- we're designing the crucible that's going to be used to test any future method for detecting remyelination.""

Allergy drug improves function in patients with chronic injury from multiple sclerosis	2017-10-29 05:00:00	https://web.archive.org/web/20171011180858/https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-10/uoc--ad100917.php	news_reviews_00158	true
"ViewRay, Inc. (Nasdaq: VRAY), maker of the world's first and only clinical MRI-guided radiation therapy system, announced today outcomes data presented during the recent 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO). This data highlighted compelling early results using the company's MRIdian system for the treatment of inoperable, locally advanced pancreatic cancer.

Unlike any other system on the market today, MRIdian allows clinicians to see the tumor and nearby soft-tissue anatomy throughout radiation treatments using real-time diagnostic MR-visualization. As a result, MRIdian's on-table adaptive radiation therapy allows doctors to respond to subtle anatomical changes observed on a day-to-day basis and reshape the dose to better match the current contours of the tumor. By more accurately targeting the tumor, and reducing treatment radiation dose to surrounding organs such as the duodenum, small bowel, stomach and liver, a higher and potentially more effective radiation dose may be delivered without increasing the risks of side effects and complications for the patient.

As featured in the ASTRO Scientific Session poster titled ""High Dose Adaptive MRI Guided Radiation Therapy Improves Overall Survival of Inoperable Pancreatic Cancer,"" key data points and findings from the presentation include the following:

The study detailed a retrospective review of 42 locally-advanced pancreatic cancer patients treated with MRIdian at four institutions (University of California Los Angeles, University of Wisconsin, VU University Medical Center, Washington University).

The authors examined survival and toxicity rates for two unique cohorts of patients. One sample received a higher biologically effective dose (maxBED10 >90), primarily enabled by MRIdian MR-guided on-table adaptive radiotherapy. The other sample received a lower, more conventional biologically effective dose (maxBED10 <90), using non-adaptive therapy.

The cohort receiving a higher dose demonstrated a near doubling of median overall survival (Kaplan-Meier estimated median overall survival of 27.8 months compared to 14.8 months).

Patients treated with higher radiation doses reported no grade 3 or higher toxicities (0 percent). In comparison, those patients receiving lower doses via non-adaptive treatments experienced 15.8 percent grade 3 or higher toxicities.

""High-definition MR now enables oncologists to detect the slightest anatomical changes that occur from one day to the next and in real-time while the patient is being treated. Coupled with new adaptive radiation therapy software tools, we create new customized plans in minutes, all while the patient is on the treatment table,"" said Percy Lee, M.D., senior author and Associate Professor and Vice Chair of Education for the Department of Radiation Oncology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. ""The data presented at the 2017 ASTRO Annual Meeting suggests that higher radiation doses with adaptive MR guided radiation therapy may improve survival in pancreatic cancer while maintaining a very favorable toxicity profile. These outcomes warrant further investigations.""

The early results highlighted above, along with other data obtained using MRIdian will be tested in a multi-center, prospective, single-arm clinical trial for inoperable, locally advanced or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. The trial will be conducted by ViewRay's Clinical Cooperative Think Tank (C2T2), a group of MRIdian medical institutions focused on evidence gathering to support MR-guided radiation therapy.

"WASHINGTON, DC (Oct. 2, 2017) -- An intensive text messaging program provides some pregnant women help in fighting the urge to light up a smoke, according to a study out today.

""Our findings show that a text messaging program helped some groups of pregnant women quit smoking during pregnancy,"" says lead author Lorien C. Abroms, ScD, MA, an associate professor of prevention and community health at Milken Institute School of Public Health (Milken Institute SPH) at the George Washington University. ""The study's findings suggest a potential new quitting strategy, especially for those later in their pregnancies and older pregnant women.""

The researchers recruited pregnant women who were already enrolled in an established text messaging program called Text4baby. Text4baby has been found to have a positive health impact on alcohol consumption during pregnancy--but not smoking. Abroms and her team wanted to find out if a more intensive mobile phone program called Quit4baby would be more effective. To find out, the team recruited nearly 500 pregnant women, who smoked an average of 7 cigarettes per day and wanted more help to quit.

Quit4baby is targeted to smoking cessation and sends more text messages--between 1 and 8 per day aimed at bolstering a pregnant woman's resolve to quit. The messages help educate the women about the health risks associated with smoking and they are interactive--allowing a woman to text back for more help if she is experiencing a craving or goes back to smoking.

After three months, 16 percent of the women who were enrolled in both Text4baby and Quit4baby had quit compared with just 11 percent of women getting just Text4baby. However, the difference between the two groups did not reach statistical significance, the authors say.

The more intensive intervention did seem to help two subgroups quit smoking at least in the short run, Abroms says. The combo of Text4baby and Quit4baby helped women age 26 and older and those in the second and third trimester of pregnancy quit through the delivery date and in some cases beyond. However, the researchers found that the resolve to quit seemed to disappear postpartum as many of these women started smoking again.

Very little help is provided to pregnant smokers who want to quit so the study's findings are important, especially if the strategy can be adjusted to be more effective, Abroms says. Despite the health risks, about 10 percent of women smoke throughout their pregnancy in the United States.

Additional studies must be done to find out if Quit4baby can be paired with other smoking cessation tools in order to provide long-term help for pregnant women who want to kick their smoking habit for good, she says.

The study, ""A Randomized Trial of Text Messaging for Smoking Cessation in Pregnant Women,"" was published October 2 in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

"Up to sixteen weeks of intermittent fasting without otherwise having to count calories helps fight obesity and other metabolic disorders. Such fasting already shows benefits after only six weeks. This is according to a study by Kyoung-Han Kim and Yun Hye Kim in the journal Cell Research which is published by Springer Nature. Intermittent fasting in mice helped to kick-start the animals' metabolism and to burn fat by generating body heat. The research team was led by Hoon-Ki Sung of The Hospital for Sick Children in Ontario, Canada.

Research has shown that our unhealthy eating habits and sedentary lifestyles are playing a major role in the development of lifestyle-related metabolic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and obesity. For this reason, dietary interventions like intermittent fasting are gaining popularity to treat conditions such as obesity.

The research team in this study wanted to better understand the reactions that interventions such as fasting trigger on a molecular level in the body. They exposed groups of mice to sixteen weeks of intermittent fasting. The recurring regimen saw the animals being fed for two days, followed by one day without anything to eat. Their calorie intake was not adjusted otherwise. Four months later the mice in the fasting group weighed less than those in the control group who continued to eat the same volume of food. The lower body weight of the mice in the fasting group was not the only effect. The fasting regime helped lower fat build-up in the white fat by increasing the brown-like fat (involved in burning energy and producing body heat) of mice on the high fat diet. Their glucose and insulin systems also remained more stable. In a further experiment, similar benefits were already seen after only six weeks of intermittent fasting.

Through an analysis into the underlying biology involved, the researchers found that such intermittent fasting tempers an immune reaction in fat cells. There are changes in certain gene pathways involved in the immune system and the body's reaction to inflammation. A type of white blood cell known to play a role in fighting inflammation is triggered. Known as anti-inflammatory macrophages, these cells stimulate the fat cells to burn stored fats or lipids by generating heat. This happens during periods of intermittent fasting because there is an increase in vascular growth factor (VEGF) that help form blood vessels and activate anti-inflammatory macrophage.

""Intermittent fasting without a reduction in calorie intake can be a preventative and therapeutic approach against obesity and metabolic disorders,"" says Kyoung-Han Kim.

""Strikingly, these fasting-stimulated changes in the growth of vascular cells and subsequent immune alterations occur even after a single cycle of 24-hour fasting, and are completely reversed when mice start eating again,"" adds Yun Hye Kim.

"Benefits of green tea were already known; new UCLA study shows that polyphenols in both varieties alter gut bacteria

UCLA researchers have demonstrated for the first time that black tea may promote weight loss and other health benefits by changing bacteria in the gut. In a study of mice, the scientists showed that black tea alters energy metabolism in the liver by changing gut metabolites.

The research is published in the European Journal of Nutrition.

The study found that both black and green tea changed the ratio of intestinal bacteria in the animals: The percentage of bacteria associated with obesity decreased, while bacteria associated with lean body mass increased.

Previous studies indicated that chemicals in green tea called polyphenols are absorbed and alter the energy metabolism in the liver. The new findings show that black tea polyphenols, which are too large to be absorbed in the small intestine, stimulate the growth of gut bacterium and the formation of short-chain fatty acids, a type of bacterial metabolites that has been shown to alter the energy metabolism in the liver.

""It was known that green tea polyphenols are more effective and offer more health benefits than black tea polyphenols since green tea chemicals are absorbed into the blood and tissue,"" said Susanne Henning, the study's lead author and an adjunct professor at the UCLA Center for Human Nutrition, which is part of the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. ""Our new findings suggest that black tea, through a specific mechanism through the gut microbiome, may also contribute to good health and weight loss in humans.""

""The results suggest that both green and black teas are prebiotics, substances that induce the growth of good microorganisms that contribute to a person's well-being,"" she said.

In the study, four groups of mice received different diets -- two of which were supplemented with green tea or black tea extracts:

Low-fat, high-sugar High-fat, high-sugar High-fat, high-sugar and green tea extract High-fat, high-sugar and black tea extract

After four weeks, the weights of the mice that were given green or black tea extracts dropped to the same levels as those of the mice that received the low-fat diet throughout the study.

The researchers also collected samples from the mice's large intestines (to measure bacteria content) and liver tissues (to measure fat deposits). In the mice that consumed either type of tea extract, there was less of the type of bacteria associated with obesity and more of the bacteria associated with lean body mass.

However, only the mice that consumed black tea extract had an increase in a type of bacteria called Pseudobutyrivibrio, which could help explain the difference between how black tea and green tea change energy metabolism.

Dr. Zhaoping Li, director of the UCLA Center for Human Nutrition, chief of the UCLA Division of Clinical Nutrition and the study's senior author, said the findings suggest that the health benefits of both green tea and black tea go beyond their antioxidant benefits, and that both teas have a strong impact on the gut microbiome.

""For black tea lovers, there may be a new reason to keep drinking it,"" she said.

The findings build on a 2015 UCLA study that demonstrated that both green tea and black tea helped prevent obesity in mice that consumed a high-fat, high-sugar diet.

###

The new study also concluded that both green tea and black tea have different effects on liver metabolism. According to Henning, the molecules in green tea are smaller and can more readily be absorbed into the body and reach the liver directly, while black tea molecules are larger and stay in the intestine rather than being absorbed. When black tea molecules stay in the intestinal tract, they enhance the growth of beneficial bacteria and the formation of microbial metabolites involved in the regulation of energy metabolism.

"A breakthrough study led by the University of Sydney's Brain and Mind Centre and Royal Prince Alfred Hospital has revealed unique molecules in the blood of people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) that could become definitive diagnostic biomarkers of the world's most common neurologic disability in young adults.

Published today in Scientific Reports, the discovery identifies tiny 'dysregulated' micro-RNA molecules that correctly diagnose MS and discriminate between patients at different disease stages - all in a simple blood test.

Currently, there is no definitive test for MS. Diagnosis and disease monitoring relies on several parameters, including clinical examination, MRI, cerebrospinal fluid assessment, and electrophysiology.

MS is a chronic disease, so current diagnostic and monitoring tests are costly and still have limited utility to discriminate between different stages of the disease.

Key findings

In addition to identifying biomarkers that distinguish healthy people from those with MS, the researchers identified nine unique micro-RNA molecules that differentiate between two MS sub-types: relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and progressive MS.

Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) affects 70 percent of people and often evolves into a secondary progressive form of MS. 10-15 percent of people with MS are diagnosed with a progressive form of the disease from the outset known as primary progressive MS.

The team also validated eight out of nine micro-RNA molecules in an independent group of progressive MS cases, confirming the reproducibility of the findings.

""This is the first demonstration that micro-RNAs associated with circulating exosomes in blood are informative biomarkers not only for the diagnosis of MS, but in predicting disease subtypes with a high degree of accuracy,"" said Associate Professor Michael Buckland, Head of the Department of Neuropathology at RPA Hospital and the Brain and Mind Centre, University of Sydney.

The research was made possible through the generosity of patients at the Brain & Mind Centre's multidisciplinary Multiple Sclerosis Clinic, a collaborative service offered by Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, and the University of Sydney. The research was funded by an Incubator grant from MS Research Australia.

""This blood test may allow people with MS to begin treatment earlier, and identify the most appropriate treatment for their condition,"" said Dr Matthew Miles, CEO MS Research Australia.

""This, in turn may lead to fewer relapses and a slower loss of brain volume, resulting in slowing or potentially halting progression of the disease for the person living with MS. It will also help remove the uncertainty surrounding which sub type of the disease an individual has and therefore be a catalyst for better outcomes for all people with MS.""

About the science

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS).

The research team assessed the utility of microRNAs (miRNA) in serum (blood) exosomes as biomarkers of MS disease.

Micro-RNA are small non-coding RNA that control many genes and processes vital for cellular life such as metabolism, development and the immune system. They are called miRNA because they are very short, only 18-25 letters long. Science has so far identified about 1800 human miRNAs.

Exosomes are nano-sized particles shed by almost all cell types in the body and are packed with micro-RNAs and other types of small RNA. The research team has shown previously that some micro-RNAs are selectively packaged into exosomes for release from the cell.

Exosomes are tiny packages released by both healthy and diseased cells in the body. They circulate in blood and can be purified in their millions from a single vial of blood. Dubbed the biological equivalent of 'tweeting', the exosomes circulate throughout the body and can deliver their cargo of information to multiple cells in almost real-time.

In inflammatory diseases such as MS, there is a significant increase in circulating exosome concentrations.

""In studying the blood exosomes of healthy volunteers and patients with MS, the research team identified a 'molecular signature' of MS that not only correctly diagnoses MS, but also discriminates between patients with different stages of disease,"" Associate Professor Buckland said.

""Exosomes released by brain cells circulating in the blood, so they offer an easily accessible way to monitor diseases of the brain. We are only now starting to wake up to their enormous potential as clinical tests.""

Given exosomes can cross the blood-brain barrier, it is likely that some of the circulating exosomes in MS patients come from affected central nervous system cells or the associated inflammatory milieu.

The researchers hypothesised that physiological changes associated with MS and its progression is reflected in differences in serum exosomal micro-RNAs.

Using next generation sequencing and integrative bioinformatics they found that serum exosome micro-RNA profiles not only distinguish MS from healthy controls, but also distinguish relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) from progressive MS with high accuracy.

"A procedure used to relieve chest pain in hundreds of thousands of heart patients each year is useless for many of them, researchers reported on Wednesday.

Their study focused on the insertion of stents, tiny wire cages, to open blocked arteries. The devices are lifesaving when used to open arteries in patients in the throes of a heart attack.

But they are most often used in patients who have a blocked artery and chest pain that occurs, for example, walking up a hill or going up stairs. Sometimes patients get stents when they have no pain at all, just blockages.

Heart disease is still the leading killer of Americans — 790,000 people have heart attacks each year — and stenting is a mainstay treatment in virtually every hospital. More than 500,000 heart patients worldwide have stents inserted each year to relieve chest pain, according to the researchers. Other estimates are far higher."	‘Unbelievable’: Heart Stents Fail to Ease Chest Pain	2017-11-02 05:00:00	https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/health/heart-disease-stents.html	story_reviews_00148	true
"A new study raised questions about the benefits of a relatively common procedure for heart patients—implanting tiny devices that prop open clogged arteries to relieve chest pain.

The 200-patient study conducted by U.K. researchers found that patients with stable chest pain, or angina, who received stent devices experienced no significant improvement in exercise time on a treadmill, compared with similar patients who received no stents during sham procedures.

All patients had received intensive treatment with heart drugs for six weeks before the real or fake procedures.

“Symptoms didn’t improve as much as expected” in the patients who received stents, Rasha Al-Lamee, an interventional cardiologist at Imperial College London and one of the study’s lead investigators, said in an interview. She presented results of the study at the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics medical conference in Denver; results were simultaneously published online Thursday by The Lancet.

Dr. Al-Lamee cautioned that the findings apply to a minority of the population of patients who now receive stents, those with narrowing of only one artery and certain other characteristics. She said the study doesn’t apply to patients having heart attacks, who may benefit from stents, and to patients with chest pain who have disease in more than one artery.

The study also found that stents improved blood supply to the heart versus placebo, she said.

Still, the study could affect a portion of a multibillion business for stent manufacturers including Medtronic PLC, Abbott Laboratories and Boston Scientific Corp. About 500,000 stents are implanted for stable angina each year world-wide, the study’s researchers wrote in The Lancet.

Abbott spokesman Jonathon Hamilton said the new study had patients with mild disease “who weren’t reflective of patients who typically undergo stenting procedures,” and that some patients received stents in the trial who wouldn’t have gotten them otherwise because of the study design.

Medtronic and Boston Scientific all referred questions about the study to a statement issued Thursday by the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, whose members include cardiologists who perform stent procedures. The SCAI said it questioned the study’s conclusions, and that SCAI believes stents are the preferred treatment for cardiac patients who need more than medicines to improve health and quality of life.

But some doctors said the study’s outcome should discourage use of stents in many patients.

The results show “unequivocally” that there are no benefits for stent procedures compared with drugs for stable angina, two cardiologists wrote in an editorial accompanying the results in The Lancet.

The cardiologists, David L. Brown of the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, and Rita F. Redberg of University of California, San Francisco, called for cardiology-treatment guidelines to downgrade the recommendation of stents for stable chest pain, and focus on treating these patients with medicine.

Past studies have proven that stents can save lives when used in acute situations like heart attacks. But other studies have challenged their uses in patients with less severe disease and symptoms, including a landmark study released in 2007. Changes to treatment guidelines since then have curbed the over-use of stent procedures, according to a 2015 study .

While the new study’s findings are being debated, it is notable for its design: It is the first to compare stents with placebo while keeping patients in the dark about whether or not they received a stent. All patients had catheters inserted in an artery and were heavily sedated before being taken into a catheter lab. But only about half were given actual stents, while the rest were left on cath-lab tables for about 15 minutes, then had the catheters removed.

Researchers chose this design to minimize the “placebo effect” seen in past studies, in which a portion of symptom improvement in patients receiving stents could be attributed to their expectation that the stent would make them feel better.

All patients in the study took drugs including aspirin, anti-platelet drugs, cholesterol-lowering statins and beta blockers for about six weeks. This was followed by baseline treadmill tests and either the stent or sham procedure. They underwent treadmill tests again six weeks after the procedures. Researchers used exercise time as the main measure because physical exertion is usually what triggers angina, and it usually goes away when patients rest, Dr. Al-Lamee said.

Patients receiving stents improved their exercise times by an average of 28 seconds, while those who didn’t improved their times by an average of nearly 12 seconds. But the difference wasn’t statistically significant, which means it could have been due to chance.

"ANN ARBOR--New research from the University of Michigan Life Sciences Institute has determined how a common holiday spice--cinnamon--might be enlisted in the fight against obesity.

Scientists had previously observed that cinnamaldehyde, an essential oil that gives cinnamon its flavor, appeared to protect mice against obesity and hyperglycemia. But the mechanisms underlying the effect were not well understood.

Researchers in the lab of Jun Wu, research assistant professor at the LSI, wanted to better understand cinnamaldehyde's action and determine whether it might be protective in humans, too.

""Scientists were finding that this compound affected metabolism,"" said Wu, who also is an assistant professor of molecular and integrative physiology at the U-M Medical School. ""So we wanted to figure out how--what pathway might be involved, what it looked like in mice and what it looked like in human cells.""

Their findings, which appear in the December issue of the journal Metabolism, indicated that cinnamaldehyde improves metabolic health by acting directly on fat cells, or adipocytes, inducing them to start burning energy through a process called thermogenesis.

Wu and her colleagues tested human adipocytes from volunteers representing a range of ages, ethnicities and body mass indices. When the cells were treated with cinnamaldehyde, the researchers noticed increased expression of several genes and enzymes that enhance lipid metabolism. They also observed an increase in Ucp1 and Fgf21, which are important metabolic regulatory proteins involved in thermogenesis.

Adipocytes normally store energy in the form of lipids. This long-term storage was beneficial to our distant ancestors, who had much less access to high-fat foods and thus a much greater need to store fat. That fat could then be used by the body in times of scarcity or in cold temperatures, which induce adipocytes to convert stored energy into heat.

""It's only been relatively recently that energy surplus has become a problem,"" Wu said. ""Throughout evolution, the opposite--energy deficiency--has been the problem. So any energy-consuming process usually turns off the moment the body doesn't need it.""

With the rising obesity epidemic, researchers like Wu have been looking for ways to prompt fat cells to activate thermogenesis, turning those fat-burning processes back on.

Wu believes that cinnamaldehyde may offer one such activation method. And because it is already used widely in the food industry, it might be easier to convince patients to stick to a cinnamon-based treatment than to a traditional drug regimen.

""Cinnamon has been part of our diets for thousands of years, and people generally enjoy it,"" Wu said. ""So if it can help protect against obesity, too, it may offer an approach to metabolic health that is easier for patients to adhere to.""

Now, before anyone goes dumping tons of extra cinnamon in their egg nog in hopes of keeping holiday-season pounds at bay, Wu cautioned that further study is needed to determine how best to harness cinnamaldehyde's metabolic benefits without causing adverse side effects.

"DARIEN, IL - Nov. 16, 2017 - A new study shows that positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy improves quality of life measures in people who have obstructive sleep apnea.

Results show that there were significant and clinically meaningful improvements in general quality of life and sleep-related quality of life measures after the initiation of PAP therapy for sleep apnea. The improvements were more robust in those who were adherent to PAP therapy.

""Quality of life is one of the most vital outcomes for patients and often one of the primary reasons to seek medical attention,"" said lead author and principal investigator Dr. Harneet Walia, assistant professor at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University and staff at the Cleveland Clinic's Sleep Disorders Center. ""We noted consistent improvement in global and sleep-specific quality-of-life measures after PAP therapy.""

The study is published in the Nov. 15 issue of the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine.

Nearly 30 million adults in the U.S. have obstructive sleep apnea, a chronic disease that involves the repeated collapse of the upper airway during sleep. Common warning signs include snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness. One treatment option for sleep apnea is PAP therapy, which uses mild levels of air pressure, provided through a mask, to keep the throat open while you sleep.

The study involved 2,027 patients with sleep apnea who began PAP therapy between Jan. 1, 2010, and Dec. 31, 2014. Participants had a mean age of 56 years, and about 54 percent were men. General quality of life measures, such as mobility and usual activity, were assessed using the European Quality of Life-5D (EQ-5D) questionnaire. Sleep-specific quality of life was examined with the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), which assesses the effect of sleep disorders and excessive daytime sleepiness on activities of daily living such as productivity and intimacy. Scores before and after up to one year of PAP therapy were compared.

Results also show that older patients and those in a higher socioeconomic subgroup had better quality of life measures after PAP therapy.

""Our study also serves as a basis for targeted efforts to optimize quality of life in younger adults and lower socioeconomic subgroups,"" said Walia. ""This information will guide clinicians in terms of expected quality of life outcomes with sleep apnea treatment."" The American Academy of Sleep Medicine previously identified quality of life as one of three sleep apnea outcome measures that clinicians can track to optimize care for adult patients. Implementation of a quality assurance program to track these quality measures can help improve patient outcomes, reduce the public health burden of sleep apnea, and provide a measurable standard for evaluating and managing sleep apnea.

"CHICAGO -- Among women with dense breast tissue, for whom traditional mammograms are less effective at detecting cancer, who request additional screening after a negative mammogram, abbreviated breast MRI (AB-MR) may be a valuable cancer detection tool. In a study of 195 asymptomatic women with dense breast tissue who had a negative mammogram within the previous 11 months, AB-MR detected five additional cancers after a negative screening mammography, according to preliminary findings from a Penn Medicine team presented this week at the Radiological Society of North America meeting in Chicago.

To put this in perspective, the cancer detection rate of mammography is roughly 4 cancers in 1,000 women who have a mammogram. Digital tomosynthesis (DBT), or 3D mammography, does slightly better, detecting approximately 25 percent more cancers, or roughly 5 cancers in 1,000 women screened. Based on the preliminary results at Penn Medicine, the cancer detection rate of AB-MR screening is 25 cancers per 1,000 patients. One in eight women in the United States will develop breast cancer at some point during their life.

""Having dense breast tissue makes it more difficult to detect a cancer on a mammogram,"" said the study's lead author, Susan Weinstein, MD, an associate professor of Radiology and the director of breast MRI at Penn Medicine. ""Based on the literature and our results, women with dense breast tissue who desire supplemental screening, these results suggest that AB-MR may be a better option than other supplemental screening tests such as whole breast ultrasound.

The most common exam offered for asymptomatic patients seeking supplemental screening is a whole breast screening ultrasound examination. However, screening ultrasound examinations have higher rates of false positives, meaning more cases of positive screenings where no cancer is present.

Based on the results from Penn's study, the AB-MR may be a better option. American Cancer Society guidelines currently recommend a full breast MRI, not an AB-MR, in women who, based on family history of breast or ovarian cancer and/or previous treatment for Hodgkin disease, have a 20 to 25 percent or greater lifetime risk of breast cancer.

"""We are committed to providing patients with the highest quality, most effective options to address their urology needs,"" said Matthias Hofer, MD , urologist at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. ""The UroLift System has an excellent safety profile and provides men suffering from an enlarged prostate a beneficial first-line treatment alternative to drug therapy or more invasive surgery. Importantly, the UroLift System provides fast and meaningful relief from BPH symptoms, improving overall quality of life for our patients.""

The UroLift System's permanent implants, delivered during a minimally-invasive procedure, act like window curtain tie-backs to hold the lobes of an enlarged prostate open. Patients recover from the procedure quickly, and return to their normal routines with minimal downtime.

Data from clinical trials showed that patients receiving UroLift implants reported rapid symptomatic improvement, improved urinary flow rates, and sustained sexual function. Patients also experienced a significant improvement in quality of life. Most common adverse events reported include hematuria, dysuria, micturition urgency, pelvic pain, and urge incontinence. Most symptoms were mild to moderate in severity and resolved within two to four weeks after the procedure.

The Northwestern Medicine Urology Program ranks amongst the nation's most experienced and well respected, providing comprehensive inpatient and outpatient care, including state-of-the-art diagnostic and treatment capabilities for men, women and adolescents.

About BPH Treatment

More than 500 million aging men worldwide have an enlarged prostate. Medication is often the first line therapy but relief can be inadequate and temporary. Side effects of treatment can include sexual dysfunction, dizziness and headaches, prompting many patients to quit using the drugs. For these patients, the classic alternative is surgery that cuts or ablates prostate tissue to open the blocked urethra. While current surgical options, such as the 'gold standard' surgery, Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP), can be very effective in relieving symptoms, they can also leave patients with permanent side effects such as urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction and retrograde ejaculation (dry orgasm).

About UroLift

The UroLift System provides an alternative to tissue removing surgery for the treatment of an enlarged prostate. Performed through the urethra, an urologist uses the UroLift System to push aside the obstructive prostate lobes and positions small, tailored permanent UroLift implants to hold the prostate lobes in the retracted position. This opens the urethra while leaving the prostate intact. Adverse reactions associated with UroLift System treatment were comparable to other minimally invasive surgical therapies as well as standard cystoscopy. The most common adverse events reported during the study included pain or burning with urination, blood in the urine, pelvic pain, urgent need to urinate, and the inability to control urine because of an urgent need to urinate. Most symptoms were mild to moderate in severity and resolved within two to four weeks after the procedure.

"The question

People treated in the emergency room for a sprain, strain or fracture are generally given opioids to help them cope with the pain, often leaving with a prescription for opioids, too. Might non-opioid painkillers work just as well as these addictive drugs?

This study

The study involved 416 adults (average age, 37) who had gone to an emergency department with an extremity injury causing moderate to severe pain (averaging 8.7 on a scale of 1 to 10).

For pain, they were randomly assigned to take acetaminophen along with a non-opioid — ibuprofen — or with one of three commonly prescribed opioids: oxycodone, hydrocodone or codeine.

Within two hours, all participants reported essentially identical declines in pain, about four points on the scale. Even for people who initially had rated their pain as a 10 (for the worst pain possible) or had broken a bone, there was virtually no difference in pain reduction between those who had and had not taken an opioid.

Who may be affected?

Adults with arm or leg pain caused by a sprain, strain or fracture. Research has shown that even short-term opioid use, such as that stemming from an initial prescription for pain from an injury or surgery, can make people predisposed to a dependence on the powerful drugs — partly from their effectiveness at relieving pain and partly from the euphoria they produce. Abuse of opioids has become an epidemic in the United States, with opioids now causing 60 percent of drug overdose deaths.

Caveats

Data on pain came from the participants' ratings; no information on side effects was collected. The study did not assess longer-term pain reduction.

"(CNN) The first large head-to-head comparison of two opioid addiction medications found that, although they were equally effective in getting people off of high levels of opioids, users had a significantly more difficult time starting a regimen of naltrexone, compared with buprenorphine.

Buprenorphine is commonly known by the the brand name Suboxone, and naltrexone is sold under the brand name Vivitrol.

The study, published Tuesday in the Lancet , looked at 570 patients with opioid addiction at eight inpatient treatment centers across the country for 24 weeks. Half of the group was assigned to naltrexone and the other half to bupenorphine.

Six percent of those enlisted to use buprenorphine were unable to start their treatment, whereas 28% of those assigned to naltrexone dropped out before starting the therapy.

That hurdle is attributed to the fact that in order to start naltrexone, a person has to have detoxed or not used opioids for several days, whereas a user can transition from opioids to buprenorphine seamlessly. ""If you're currently opiate-dependent ... (naltrexone) takes more work,"" said Dr. Joshua Lee , the lead author of the study, who studies opioid addiction behavior and treatment at New York University.

Once on either of the medications, people fared equally well. ""They tend to stay on medications about the same rate. They report good outcomes, avoiding heroin use,"" Lee said. However, both groups also reported similar challenges staying with the regimens: Just 40% of patients still used the drugs after 24 weeks.

What was important, Lee said, was for opioid addicts as well as treatment providers to understand that addiction isn't one-size-fits-all. ""Much like you would expect if the doctor told you 'you have cancer' or 'you have diabetes,' then there are different ways you could pursue treatment,"" he said.

The gold standard of addiction treatment

Public health experts consider medicated-assisted treatment the gold standard of opioid addiction treatment. It combines medication with counseling to help addicts wean off of high opioid use. Public health experts say it can help solve the staggering opioid overdose epidemic.

This year alone, the CDC estimates that more than 64,000 people have died of drug overdoses, most of them from opioids -- more than the number of American troops lost during the entire Vietnam War . Studies have found that using medicated-assisted treatments can reduce overdose mortality by half.

Methadone may be the best-known form of medicated-assisted treatment, but it requires patients to have the drug administered daily in a clinic. Two other options have become increasingly popular: buprenorphine, which can be taken outside a clinic, and naltrexone, which is administered monthly.

Naltrexone has become become an increasingly popular choice among drug courts . Some say that's because of the once-a-month administration, and others say it's because it requires that users completely detox before starting the regimen.

Understanding addiction

""People need choices,"" said Caleb Banta-Green, a professor at the University of Washington's School of Public Health. Banta-Green, who was not involved in the new study, said that getting the right treatment means understanding addiction from a psychological as well as biological perspective.

Legally prescribed opioid drugs like oxycodone and hydrocodone work in the same manner as illicit drugs like heroin. They all chemically bind to the opioid receptors in the brain to help dull pain and, in some people, provide euphoria.

The body also produces natural opioids, but the more narcotics a person takes, the less opioids the body naturally produces. Without the opioids, people can go into withdrawal, all contributing to a cycle of dependency.

""To feel normal, they need opiates on those receptors,"" Banta-Green said. Buprenorphine and methadone, which are opioids, work by reducing people's cravings. ""They bind to prevent withdrawal, giving some opiate effect,"" he said.

On the other hand, naltrexone works by chemically blocking those receptors, which is why someone needs to detox before starting the regimen. ""You're not getting an opiate effect,"" Banta-Green explained.

If a person takes an opioid while on naltrexone, it is unlikely they will feel any opioid sensation. If a person is using opioids and takes naltrexone, it can induce a feeling of withdrawal. ""It addresses craving in a different way. The person knows they can't use,"" he said.

So, for example, a person who is actively using opioids and can't manage the withdrawals may be better suited for buprenorphine, while someone coming from a facility where he or she has detoxed and who doesn't want to use opioids may be better suited for naltrexone.

What is key, said Dr. Miriam Komaromy, is meeting a patient where they are and understanding what best meets their needs.

Addiction ""is an incredibly deadly disease,"" said Komaromy, an addiction specialist at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center. And as public policymakers, prisons and drug courts play a larger role in treating addiction, public health experts like Komaromy argue that it is imperative to look at ""evidence-based ways instead of having a moralistic view.""

Banta-Green says he talks to a lot of judges who are trying to understand addiction treatment. ""I say this a lot to judges: You can't just offer one medication. Just like any other medication, some people are going to feel right with one as opposed to the other."""

"The American Heart Association has changed the definition of hypertension for the first time in 14 years, moving the number from the old standard of 140/90 to the newly revised 130/80.

The change is outlined in the American Heart Association 2017 Hypertension Practice Guidelines, an extensive report by experts without relevant ties to the pharmaceutical industry.

The changes are expected to drastically impact adult Americans: revising the hypertension threshold downward will increase the percent of U.S. adults living with high blood pressure from 32 percent to 46 percent -- nearly half of the adult population. It will also disproportionately affect younger people by tripling the number of men under 45 and doubling the number of women under 45 with the diagnosis.

American Heart Association

The new guidelines reflect years of research, which have shown that people within the new range of blood pressure defined as hypertension have doubled their risk of cardiovascular problems in the future, such as heart attacks or strokes. As such, health care professionals should be identifying these patients and helping to initiate interventions to bring down blood pressure.

While the new guidelines significantly increase the number of Americans with a diagnosis of hypertension, they do not suggest a proportionate increase in treating with medication. The number of Americans with hypertension who are recommended for medical treatment would increase by only 4.2 million adults, or 5 percent more than were previously recommended. Medication will be recommended for patients with previous cardiovascular events, such as heart attack, or significant cardiovascular risk factors determined by factors such as age, blood tests and having other medical conditions that increase risk of heart attack.

The study authors recommend lifestyle changes, including exercise, diet modifications and weight loss, as the first step to reducing high blood pressure.

Doctors in the guidelines stress the importance of using two separate blood pressure readings on two different occasions to diagnose hypertension. They recommend that those with hypertension use approved blood pressure monitors at home. Writing down these readings at home can help tell the difference between people with truly abnormal blood pressure and those with “white-coat syndrome” -- with high blood pressure only under stress like at the doctor’s office.

High blood pressure increases the risk of cardiac problems and strokes, and is sometimes called “the silent killer” because so many adults live with high blood pressure and don’t know it.

"The 161 subjects involved in the study consumed at least three portions of chicken and eggs per week, that were naturally enriched with omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFA), the same nutrients found in oily fish.

The results from the clinical study saw an increase in omega-3-PUFA levels in blood and a positive shift in what is described as the 'omega-3 Index'-a test that measures the amount of the omega-3 fatty acids, Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) and Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) in red blood cell membranes, which reflects the levels in your heart and other tissues.

A low omega-3 Index (<4%) indicates a heightened risk of heart and brain disease. The study showed that consuming omega-3 enriched chicken and eggs resulted in a halving of the number of subjects with such a high-risk omega-3 Index.

The chicken meat and eggs used in the study came from birds offered OmegaPro, a sustainable and algae-based source of omega-3 PUFA, developed by Devenish.

The findings were presented by Professor Alice Stanton of The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland:

""Greater consumption of oily fish has long been linked to a reduced incidence of heart attack, stroke, diabetes and cancer and improved brain health, vision, muscle and joint health,"" said Professor Alice Stanton.

""International guidelines recommend eating oily fish at least once per week, however, many people do not eat fish at all and less than 20% of the world's population have optimal omega-3 PUFA levels.

""Therefore, in this project we studied the recently developed alternatives to oily fish or supplementation, namely chicken meat and eggs, naturally enriched with sustainable algae-based omega-3 PUFA.

""Omega-3 enriched chicken and eggs offer consumers an attractive alternative to eating oily fish or to the lifelong taking of supplements, with the potential for substantial health benefits,"" Professor Stanton said.

Dr. Heather Hayes, Director of Food Innovation with Devenish, said:

""Offering birds a natural and sustainable source of omega-3 PUFA is good for the bird and good for the consumer. Taste panel studies have shown that the omega-3 enriched chicken meat tastes as good, if not better than conventional chicken.

""This science has demonstrated the importance of food nutrients to promote good health and prevent ill health. We are also focusing our research efforts on producing sustainable and nutrient rich pork, beef and milk, with scientifically proven health claims. Omega-3 is just one nutrient that we are interested in-we are working on others too.""

Owen Brennan, Executive Chairman, Devenish, added:

""We worked closely with Moy Park, Waitrose and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, to deliver an innovative, nutrient-rich food, that increases omega-3 levels in consumers, naturally. The science shows the importance of food nutrients to promote good health in consumers and the innovation starts on the farm.

""The farmer has a key role to play in delivering sustainable and nutritious food with a health claim. Devenish is working hard to increase the opportunity for consumers to benefit from this nutrient-rich food, as less than 20% of the world's population is eating enough Omega-3.""

Dr. Patrick Wall, Professor of Public Health at University College Dublin, said:

""By enriching the birds' diet, the meat and eggs become naturally enriched with omega-3 PUFA and the associated nutritional benefits are then passed on to consumers.

""Morbidity is unevenly distributed in society and poorer people experience poorer health. By including the omega-3 in chicken and eggs, both very affordable sources of quality protein, all segments of the population can benefit from this approach to using innovative animal nutrition to benefit human health.""

Professor Chris Elliott, Founder of the Institute for Global Food Security & Pro Vice Chancellor, Faculty of Medicine, Health & Life Sciences, Queens University Belfast said:

""The cost to the health service of treating cardiovascular related illness in the UK is £10billion/year. Having access to sustainably produced nutrient-rich food, with a scientifically proven health claim, offers huge potential to turn this around globally.""

"(CNN) A saliva test may someday be able to diagnose a concussion and predict how long symptoms last, according to a study published Monday in the JAMA Pediatrics.

In their study, Penn State College of Medicine researchers found five small molecules called microRNAs in saliva with real potential for identifying concussive symptoms in children, teens and young adults. MicroRNAs influence protein activities throughout the body, and they are easily measured in biofluids, including blood, cerebrospinal fluid and saliva, according to the authors.

Dr. Steve Hicks, senior author of the study and an assistant professor of pediatrics at Penn State College of Medicine, said the ""five microRNAs in saliva could predict with approximately 85% accuracy which concussed children would have symptoms one month later. In comparison, standard survey measures that are typically used in clinics were approximately 65% accurate.""

The study was funded in part by Quadrant Biosciences, a biotech company that hopes to bring a saliva test for concussion to market in the next 12 to 24 months, Hicks said.

Concussions affect mostly children

In 2013, there were about 2.8 million traumatic brain injury-related ER visits, hospitalizations and deaths in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

JUST WATCHED Concussions keep kids out of school Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Concussions keep kids out of school 01:08

Nearly two-thirds of concussions take place in children and teens, Hicks and his co-authors noted. Although most patients' symptoms disappear within two weeks, one-third of children and teens may experience prolonged symptoms of concussion.

""It's frustrating for both parents and physicians that we can't accurately and objectively predict how long a child's concussion symptoms might last, what those symptoms are likely to consist of and when it might be safe for them to return to sports or school,"" said Hicks, who, as a practicing pediatrician, has routinely cared for kids with concussions.

For the study, Hicks and his co-authors looked at 52 patients between the ages of 7 and 21, with an average age of 14.

MicroRNA expression was measured in saliva spit into a cup by the patients, who had been injured mostly in sports or car accidents, when they arrived at Penn State Hershey Medical Center for an evaluation. Of the 52, 30 had prolonged symptoms and 22 had short-term symptoms of mild traumatic brain injury.

Levels of five microRNAs accurately identified patients with prolonged symptoms in the study. Even more, the five saliva biomarkers were more accurate than the Standardized Concussion Assessment Tool 3, a questionnaire currently used to help make a diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury. The questionnaire is not a standalone tool but one used in conjunction with an assessment made by a medical professional. It notes that an athlete may have a concussion even if their score is ""normal.""

""We found three microRNAs that were highly associated with specific symptoms one month after injury, such as headache, fatigue and memory difficulties,"" Hicks said. He added that creating an actual test for use by doctors will require collaboration on the part of researchers.

""Fortunately, the technology required to measure saliva RNA is already employed in medicine; we use it to check patients for upper respiratory viruses in our hospitals and clinics every day,"" Hicks said. ""Modifying this approach for patients with concussions could potentially provide a rapid, objective tool for managing brain injury.""

The new research ""represents an advance in the science of sport-related concussions,"" according to an editorial published alongside the study in JAMA Pediatrics.

'Way too early to know'

However, the editorial authors, Dr. William P. Meehan III of Micheli Center for Sports Injury Prevention at Boston Children's Hospital in Massachusetts and Dr. Rebekah Mannix of Brain Injury Center at Boston Children's Hospital, noted that ""the relatively small sample size in this study requires larger-scale studies to determine the reliability"" of the results.

For example, they noted that the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications is common among those with more severe injury. In the study, those who had used anti-inflammatory medications were the ones with longer-term symptoms. Possibly, then, the drugs may be a potential 'confounding' variable, they wrote, meaning that medication may influence test results and symptoms, adding an element of confusion to the study and its possible interpretation.

Still, ""the findings are promising, representing potential biomarkers for the diagnosis, recovery, and prognostic assessment of a sport-related concussion.""

Dr. Jeffrey Kutcher, a neurologist and National Director of The Sports Neurology Clinic at The CORE Institute, said that ""work like this is important because it does provide potential for tests that can be helpful in the clinical setting.""

""I think the main caveat is, this is way too early to know what this type of tool can do for us,"" added Kutcher, who was not involved in the new research. ""The main reason is that there's a difference between simply having a brain that experiences force and being concussed.""

The saliva biomarker may be showing that neurons experienced force and not that a there is a concussion, with which the brain cannot perform its typical functions within a normal range, he said: ""I would hesitate to assign too much potential groundbreaking science.""

Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.

Other biomarkers, including blood, are being investigated as potential concussion tests, he said, though ""nothing is at this stage or beyond this.""

There are also tools that look at the electrical networks that brains form, he said, disclosing that he is consulting for a company working on one such technology. A patient undergoes an electroencephalogram while doing a cognitive task, and the EEG records how the brain responds.

""By actually (measuring) the brain network activity directly, you can look at really what is the functional health of the brain,"" he said.

In addition, some scientists are exploring functional MRI techniques to look at the metabolic function of different areas of the brain to gain insight into concussion, he said.

Hicks said he and his colleagues are collaborating with others to examine saliva biomarkers in adult athletes and members of the armed services.

""Because the markers we identified in this study are not correlated with patient age, we are hopeful they may be applied in adult populations, as well,"" he said."

"A Wisconsin woman traveled hundreds of miles to MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington for a delicate operation: replacing under-arm lymph nodes lost in cancer surgery. A small but growing number of hospitals offer the procedure. See photos.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Breast cancer treatment left Susan Wolfe-Tank with an arm too painfully swollen to lift anything heavy or even fit into her usual clothing — a debilitating condition that gets little attention and has no cure.

Desperate, the Wisconsin woman traveled hundreds of miles to seek a delicate operation — replacing under-arm lymph nodes lost in cancer surgery — as a small but growing number of hospitals offer microsurgical attempts at relief from lymphedema that help some patients but not all.

“Right in this area, feel that — that is your lymph node,” Dr. David Song of MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington told Wolfe-Tank during a recent check-up.

Song, Georgetown’s plastic surgery chief, had removed healthy lymph nodes from Wolfe-Tank’s back and side and implanted them in the affected arm. As the new nodes took root, her arm was shrinking. A delighted Song’s only caution: “Take care of them,” by wearing a compression sleeve as prescribed.

“This isn’t a cure. I will still have to be careful,” said Wolfe-Tank, 51, of Hurley, Wisconsin. But, “I will be able to cross-country ski again, just live a normal life. Look at my arm, it’s incredible.”

Lymphedema is a chronic swelling, often in an arm or leg, that in severe cases can be disfiguring, impair mobility, cause disabling pain, harden the skin and lead to infection.

Lymph nodes work like biological pumps in a network that’s part of the immune system. They drain watery fluid called lymph that, traveling through tiny channels, brings nutrients to cells and takes away bacteria and waste material. Lose or damage enough lymph nodes or channels in a particular area and that fluid builds up.

There’s no good count, but millions of Americans are estimated to have some degree of lymphedema, and while it can be hereditary or result from injury, many U.S. cases are a lasting side effect of treatment for a variety of cancers.

Consider breast cancer. While better surgical techniques in recent decades have lowered the risk, experts estimate that still about 6 percent of breast cancer survivors who undergo a “sentinel node biopsy” — removing a few nodes to check for spreading cancer — will develop lymphedema. That risk jumps to about 20 percent for women like Wolfe-Tank who need additional lymph nodes removed because of more advanced cancer. Radiation causes further harm.

Yet too often women aren’t warned about symptoms or checked for early signs, when lymphedema is more easily treated, said Dr. Sheldon Feldman of New York’s Montefiore Einstein Center for Cancer Care. He co-authored physician guidelines issued this fall by the American Society of Breast Surgeons on prevention and treatment of breast cancer-related lymphedema.

Typical patients have “had that swelling for a while,” Feldman said. “Now the treatment is an uphill battle.”

The main treatment consists of wearing compression bandages and massage to bring down swelling. A lymphedema specialist initially prescribed a large pump that massaged Wolfe-Tank’s arm for an hour a night, temporarily relieving some of the pain.

“But if I used my arm, I was back to square one,” Wolfe-Tank said. “I didn’t fit into my coat anymore. I live in the snow capital of Wisconsin. I’m not supposed to shovel. We’ve got to fix this.”

Wolfe-Tank had struggled for four years when an oncologist recommended lymph node transfer. The rationale: There are more lymph nodes in the body’s trunk than in the limbs — more avenues to drain off fluid — and thus it should be safe to move a few. Hunting for a surgeon, Wolfe-Tank found Song, who transferred about five nodes along with supportive blood vessels and other tissue, hoping they’d grow new channels to drain fluid.

It’s not the only option. A technique called lymphovenous bypass reroutes lymph-carrying channels, going around damaged or missing nodes to drain into veins instead.

Some surgeons use a variation of that technique protectively, in hopes of preventing lymphedema from forming in the first place. During the initial cancer surgery, they check which lymph-carrying channels the node removal left dangling — and connect them to blood vessels to drain.

“Surgical options offer great potential,” note the breast surgeons’ new guidelines. But they don’t work for everyone.

About a third of lymph node transfer patients see some positive effect, Song said.

And Feldman noted that over about the past decade, the microsurgeries have been studied only in small research trials, and results vary with surgeon experience. One debate is whether to offer lymph node transfer early, before patients build up as much damage as Wolfe-Tank did. Insurance coverage also varies.

Feldman’s bottom line: Patients considering microsurgery should be evaluated in a comprehensive lymphedema program to determine their best options.

Replacing lymph nodes to ease painful legacy of cancer care	2017-11-27 12:40:00	https://web.archive.org/web/20180319011237/https://wtop.com/local/2017/11/replacing-lymph-nodes-to-ease-painful-legacy-of-cancer-care/slide/1/	story_reviews_00140	true
"An emerging treatment for a common hospital-acquired infection could be (slightly) less gross in the future. Researchers have found that delivering a fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) in a pill—a poop pill, basically—is no worse than a similar procedure done with a colonoscopy.

Neither option may sound particularly enticing, but FMTs are wildly effective at treating a very nasty infection called Clostridium difficile. One of the first controlled clinical trials for FMTs in 2013 ended early because the patients who received the treatment were doing so much better than patients who didn’t. In the new study, almost 90 percent of adults treated with the capsules were cured.

“It’s absolutely insane. We just don’t see kind of efficacy with drugs,” Dr. Dina Kao told Newsweek. Kao is one of the authors of the paper and a gastroenterologist at the University of Alberta. Kao and her colleagues published the findings in the Journal of the American Medical Association on Tuesday.

C. difficile infections can set in after a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which can wipe out some of the bacterial populations normally found in people’s gut. The transplants work by replacing those “healthy” bacteria. “C. difficile is the single biggest cause of diarrhea in a health care setting,” Kao said. “It is our public enemy No. 1 in hospitals.”

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, C. difficile infects half a million people in the United States per year and kills 15,000 people. But patients may be hesitant to accept this potentially life-saving treatment because there are feces involved. Previous research found that while every part of this treatment was unappealing to most people, being offered the treatment in a pill form made patients significantly more open to the idea. Other efforts to take the “poop” out of the poop pills—to just include the bacteria thought to be behind the benefits—have failed.

The 116 patients used in this study may have been selected in part because they were ideal candidates for FMTs, Dr. Elizabeth Hohmann noted, but she said the paper is solid overall. (Hohmann, a researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital who has also done research on FMTs, was not involved in his research.) “The results are sort of a best-case scenario,” she said. “What I like about this paper is that it validates the upper-GI route and demonstrates that you can get very good cure rates without doing a colonoscopy.”

That’s important because colonoscopies and the anesthesia required for the procedure can put a lot of stress on a person’s body and can be complicated for the people most at risk for C. difficile infections, Hohmann noted

Kao’s study also showed that people found FMTs far less unpleasant when the poop came in a pill. Two-thirds of the 57 patients who got the pills said their experiences were “not at all unpleasant,” while just 44 percent of the 59 patients who received the FMT via a colonoscopy could say the same.

But most importantly, the study found no difference in effectiveness between the two therapies. There was a significant difference in cost. Though the procedures were done in a Canadian hospital, the FMTs delivered by colonoscopy cost nearly $500 USD more than the capsules, which cost about $300.

FMTs are not yet common practice, though Kao noted that it is becoming the standard of care for C. difficile infections. “For this group of patients, nothing else really works,” she said. However, the same cannot be said yet for other conditions. While the FDA said in 2013 that doctors can try fecal transplants in patients with C. difficile infections, the agency noted doctors should only use FMT for other conditions in clinical trials. Over 100 clinical trials are ongoing for various FMT therapies, including ones to treat ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease in children. (New FDA guidelines have been in the works since 2016 but aren’t finalized.)

Despite the FDA’s advice, some people have set up shop as FMT providers anyway. Buzzfeed reported in June that one clinic in Tampa was even providing FMTs as a treatment for autism.

Though physicians think they know how FMTs work, it remains somewhat mysterious. One recent, small study found that even stool samples that are entirely free of bacteria can be effective, perhaps because there are non-bacterial organisms that also help.

“We still don’t understand what’s going on, and in these other conditions it’s not as clear-cut that the disturbance in the bacterial composition is the cause,” Kao said. “Stool is such a complex mixture.”"	Eating a Poop Pill Works to Cure This Deadly and Common Hospital Infection	2017-11-28 18:09:40	https://web.archive.org/web/20171128203903/http://www.newsweek.com/poop-pill-cure-deadly-and-common-hospital-infection-724329	story_reviews_00139	true
"CHICAGO - The majority of patients were pain free after receiving a new image-guided pulsed radiofrequency treatment for low back pain and sciatica, according to a study presented today at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA).

Low back pain is an extremely common problem that affects at least 80 percent of the population at some point in their lifetime. It is the most common cause of job-related disability. Low back pain affects men and women equally.

Most back pain is short-term, but about 20 percent of people affected by acute low back pain go on to develop chronic low back pain lasting a year or more. A compressed and herniated disk, in which the rubbery cushion between vertebrae impinges on and irritates nearby nerves, is a major cause of low back pain that can radiate to the legs.

""The nerve root is a sensitive structure that when pinched becomes inflamed and causes pain,"" said lead investigator Alessandro Napoli M.D., Ph.D., an interventional radiologist at Sapienza University of Rome. ""The body reacts with muscle constriction, which decreases the distance between vertebrae, and a vicious cycle is created.""

The single-center prospective study included 80 patients experiencing at least three months of low back pain due to a herniated disk that had not responded to conservative treatments including exercise and medication.

The patients underwent a minimally invasive interventional radiology procedure in which, with the help of CT imaging, a needle is guided to the location of the bulging disc and nerve root. A probe is then inserted through the needle tip and delivers pulsed radiofrequency energy to the area over a 10-minute period. Even without touching the disc, the pulsation serves to resolve the herniation.

""The probe delivers a gentle electrical energy, so there's no thermal damage,"" Dr. Napoli said. ""The results have been extraordinary. Patients have been relieved of pain and resumed their normal activities within a day.""

Of the 80 patients treated, 81 percent were pain free one year after a single 10-minute treatment session. Six patients required a second pulsed radiofrequency session. Ninety percent of the patients were able to avoid surgical treatment.

""Following this treatment, inflammation and pain go away. With relaxation of the muscles, the distance between the vertebrae returns,"" Dr. Napoli explained.

Dr. Napoli said no patients experienced side effects after receiving the minimally invasive outpatient treatment.

""There's a big gap between conservative treatments for disc compression and herniation and surgical repair, which can lead to infection, bleeding and a long recovery period,"" Dr. Napoli said. ""Evolving technologies like this image-guided treatment may help a substantial number of patients avoid surgery.""

"Scientists working to develop a 'game-changing' new antibiotic have made a significant advance towards creating commercially viable drug treatments by producing two simplified synthetic versions of the substance which are just as potent at killing superbugs like MRSA as its natural form.

The breakthrough by researchers at the University of Lincoln, UK, marks another important step to realising the potential of teixobactin in aiding the global fight against antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Teixobactin is a recently discovered natural antibiotic which many in the international scientific community believe could lead to creation of the first commercially viable new antibiotic drug in 30 years.

The Lincoln team has successfully synthesized new simplified versions of teixobactin which harness the same powerful antibiotic effects in a way that could be produced on a commercial scale. Their findings are published in the Royal Society of Chemistry's journal, Chemical Science.

Until now, scientists attempting to synthesise teixobactin believed they needed to use cationic (or positively charged) amino acids which bind to the bacterial target using a 'side chain'. This meant they had to use either the very rare amino acid found naturally in teixobactin, called enduracididine, or alternative ones which had lower potency against superbugs.

Each amino acid sits at a specific place in teixobactin's structure, and the Lincoln team has now successfully replaced enduracididine - which holds position ten - with two alternative amino acids which are not positively charged. These amino acids lack the 'binding' part, over-turning the prior understanding that enduracididine is essential for to so-called 'target binding' to be highly potent against superbugs.

With this new knowledge, synthesised versions of teixobactin can be more easily developed, taking the process from up to 30 hours to just ten minutes for a single coupling step - a significant step towards turning teixobactin into a viable new drug. Importantly, the two new simplified forms of teixobactin have also proven to have identical potency against superbugs as the natural form of teixobactin.

Dr Ishwar Singh, a specialist in novel drug design and development from the University of Lincoln's School of Pharmacy, is leading the research team. He explained: ""When teixobactin was discovered it was ground breaking in itself as a new antibiotic which kills bacteria without detectable resistance including superbugs such as MRSA. We have been investigating a way to simplify the design while retaining the high potency against resistant bacteria such as MRSA.

""This simplified design and more efficient synthesise will enable work to be carried out at a commercial level. Enduracididine was severely limiting our ability to do this because of its scarcity, a complex multistep synthesis, and long and repetitive steps of between 16 and 30 hours with high failure rate and very low yields.

""We needed to make a change to the structure so that we could make the molecule more viable for drug development. We had tried replacing it with other amino acids with a similar make up, but they all were less potent in comparison to the natural form of teixobactin. Now, we have discovered that we can in fact use amino acids which are structurally different, and are commercially-available. They are also 16 times more potent than a clinically-used antibiotic in killing the superbug MRSA, and they were also highly potent against other antibiotic-resistant infections, such as vancomycin resistant enterococci, and tuberculosis.""

The work builds on the success of the team's pioneering research to tackle antimicrobial resistance over the past 18 months. Dr Singh is working with colleagues from the School of Life Sciences and the School of Chemistry at the University of Lincoln to develop teixobactins into a viable drug.

It has been predicted that by 2050 an additional 10 million people will succumb to drug resistant infections each year. The development of new antibiotics which can be used as a last resort when other drugs are ineffective is therefore a crucial area of study for healthcare researchers around the world.

"Standard guidelines for stroke treatment currently recommend clot removal only within six hours of stroke onset. But a milestone study with results published today in the New England Journal of Medicine shows that clot removal up to 24 hours after stroke led to significantly reduced disability for properly selected patients.

The international multi-center clinical study, known as the DAWN trial, randomly assigned 206 stroke victims who arrived at the hospital within six to 24 hours to either endovascular clot removal therapy, known as thrombectomy, or to standard medical therapy.

Thrombectomy involves a catheter placed in the femoral artery and snaked up the aorta and into the cerebral arteries where the clot that is blocking the artery, and causing the neurological symptoms, is retrieved.

Almost half of the patients (48.6 percent) who had clot removal showed a considerable decrease in disability, meaning they were independent in activities of daily living 90 days after treatment. Only 13.1 percent of the medication group had a similar decrease. There was no difference in mortality or other safety end-points between the two groups.

""These findings could impact countless stroke patients all over the world who often arrive at the hospital after the current six-hour treatment window has closed,"" says co-principal investigator Raul Nogueira, MD, professor of neurology, neurosurgery and radiology at Emory University School of Medicine and director of neuroendovascular service at the Marcus Stroke & Neuroscience Center at Grady Memorial Hospital.

""When the irreversibly damaged brain area affected by the stroke is small, we see that clot removal can make a significant positive difference, even if performed outside the six-hour window,"" says co-principal investigator Tudor Jovin, MD, director of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Stroke Institute. ""However, this does not diminish urgency with which patients must be rushed to the ER in the event of a stroke. The mantra 'time is brain' still holds true.""

To select patients for the trial, the researchers used a new approach which used brain imaging and clinical criteria as opposed to just time alone.

""Looking at the physiological state of the brain and evaluating the extent of tissue damage and other clinical factors seems to be a better way to decide if thrombectomy will benefit patients as opposed to adhering to a rigid time window,"" says Nogueira.

The researchers planned to enroll a maximum of 500 patients over the course of the study period. However, a pre-planned interim review of the treatment effectiveness after 200 patients were enrolled in the trial led the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board overseeing the study to recommend early termination of the trial, based on pre-defined criteria demonstrating that clot removal provided significant clinical benefit in the studied patients.

""Our research and clinical teams are immensely proud of these breakthrough findings, which are so profound they will likely result in a paradigm shift that will not be seen again for many years in the field of stroke therapeutics,"" says Michael Frankel, MD, professor of neurology, Emory University School of Medicine, chief of neurology and director of the Marcus Stroke and Neuroscience Center for the Grady Health System.

According to Frankel, the Emory neuroscience team was a major contributor to the DAWN trial, working at Grady Memorial Hospital, the second leading site of the trial's enrollment.

The DAWN trial included trial locations in the United States, Spain, France, Australia and Canada. The trial was sponsored by Stryker Corporation, a medical technology company that manufactures the clot removal devices used in the study.

The DAWN trial results were presented at the European Stroke Organization Conference in May.

"A new paper in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute finds that testing for cervical cancer using HPV testing in addition to the Pap smear is unlikely to detect cancer cases that wouldn't be found using HPV testing alone.

The main goal of cervical screening programs is to detect and treat precancer before cancer develops. Cytology-based screening, known as the Pap test or Pap smear, is used to detect abnormal cells. The Pap test can also find noncancerous conditions, such as infections and inflammation.

Cervical cancer screening guidelines have changed dramatically over the last 15 years, following introduction of testing for the dozen high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types that cause virtually all cervical cancer and its precursors. Despite more research into HPV, and the introduction of preventive HPV vaccines, screening will remain important and comprise many millions of tests annually for decades to come. But improved screening methods have also introduced some confusion, even controversy.

HPV testing is more sensitive than the Pap test for detecting precancer. The HPV test captures the known cancer causing viruses, but there are gynecologists who believe that there may be unknown cancer causing viruses and so continue to do the Pap smear (plus HPV testing).

However, reports of rare HPV-negative, Pap-test-positive cancers are motivating continued use of both tests (cotesting) despite increased testing costs. An HPV test, in which doctors test a cervicovaginal specimen for the presence of the nucleic acids of carcinogenic types of HPV, is more sensitive than the Pap test (a microscopic examination of exfoliated cells) for detection of precancers. Thus, if a single screening method were chosen to complement HPV vaccination, primary HPV testing likely would gradually supplant the Pap test.

In the US, an interim guidance issued by a committee of experts from several clinical societies recommended primary HPV testing every three years, the same as the Pap test. Alternatively, current guidelines recommend cotesting but, in recognition of the additional reassurance provided by this approach compared with the Pap test alone, the screening interval is extended to every five years. Draft guidelines from the US Preventive Services Task Force recently recommended either primary HPV testing every five years or the Pap test every three years for women 30 to 64, and did not recommend cotesting.

The accumulated evidence supports inclusion of HPV testing in screening; thus, the main choice moving forward is between cotesting and primary HPV testing alone.

Researchers were searching for realistic performance data to quantify the additional benefit of the Pap test component of cotesting, as the costs of intensive screening of all women using two screening tests are substantial.

In January 2003, just prior to US FDA approval of HPV and Pap test cotesting in mid-2003 and interim guidelines in 2004, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large integrated health care organization, introduced three-year cotesting in women aged 30 years and older. Kaiser Permanente has now screened over a million women by cotesting. This remains the most extensive experience of HPV testing incorporated into routine screening in the world.

Researchers here quantified the detection of cervical precancer and cancer by cotesting compared with HPV testing alone at Kaiser Permanente, where 1,208,710 women have undergone triennial cervical cotesting since 2003. Screening histories preceding cervical cancers (n=623) and precancers (n=5,369) were examined to assess the relative contribution of the Pap test and HPV test components in identifying cases.

The analysis found that HPV testing identified more women subsequently diagnosed with cancer and precancer than the Pap test. HPV testing was statistically significantly more likely to be positive for cancer at any time point, except within 12 months. HPV-negative/ Pap test-positive results preceded only small fractions of cases of precancer (3.5%) and cancer (5.9%); these cancers were more likely to be regional or distant stage than other cases.

Given the rarity of cancers among screened women, the contribution of the Pap test to screening translated to earlier detection of at most five cases per million women per year. Two-thirds (67.9%) of women found to have cancer up to 10 years of follow-up at Kaiser Permanente were detected by the first cotest performed.

The researchers conclude that the added sensitivity of cotesting versus HPV alone for detection of treatable cancer affected extremely few women.?

"Bottom Line: For adults coming to the emergency department for arm or leg pain due to sprain, strain, or fracture, there was no difference in pain reduction after 2 hours with ibuprofen-acetaminophen vs three comparison opioid-acetaminophen (paracetamol) combinations.

Why The Research Is Interesting: The United States is facing an opioid epidemic with almost 500,000 individuals dying from opioid overdoses since 2000. Despite the epidemic, opioid analgesics remain a first-line treatment for moderate to severe acute pain in the emergency department. The combination of ibuprofen and acetaminophen may represent an effective non-opioid alternative.

Who: 416 patients (ages 21 to 64 years) with moderate to severe acute extremity pain in two urban emergency departments were randomly assigned to receive

400 mg ibuprofen and 1,000 mg acetaminophen

5 mg oxycodone and 325 mg acetaminophen

5 mg hydrocodone and 300 mg acetaminophen; or

30 mg codeine and 300 mg acetaminophen

When: July 2015 to August 2016

What (Study Measures): The between-group difference in decline in pain two hours after taking the study drugs.

How (Study Design): This was a randomized clinical trial (RCT). Randomized trials allow for the strongest inferences to be made about the true effect of an intervention such as a medication or a procedure. However, not all RCT results can be replicated because patient characteristics or other variables in real-world settings may differ from those that were studied in the RCT.

Authors: Andrew K. Chang, M.D., M.S., of Albany Medical College, Albany, New York, and coauthors

Results: After 2 hours pain was less in all participants, without any important difference in effect between the four groups.

Study Limitations: The results apply only to pain after two hours. About 1 in 5 patients required additional medication to control their pain.

Study Conclusions: There were no important differences in pain reduction after 2 hours with ibuprofen-acetaminophen or opioid-acetaminophen combination pills in emergency department patients with acute extremity pain. The findings suggest that ibuprofen-acetaminophen is a reasonable alternative to opioid management of acute extremity pain due to sprain, strain, or fracture, but further research to assess longer-term effect, adverse events and dosing is warranted.

"Weight training or cardio? For older adults trying to slim down, pumping iron might be the way to go.

A new study by researchers at Wake Forest University suggests combining weight training with a low-calorie diet preserves much needed lean muscle mass that can be lost through aerobic workouts.

The findings, ""Effect of Exercise Type During Intentional Weight Loss on Body Composition in Older Adults with Obesity,"" appear in the November issue of the journal Obesity.

""A lot of older adults will walk as their exercise of choice,"" said Kristen Beavers, assistant professor of health and exercise science at Wake Forest and lead author of the study. ""But this research shows that if you're worried about losing muscle, weight training can be the better option.""

In this 18-month study of 249 adults in their 60s who were overweight or obese, restricting calories plus resistance training in the form of weight-machine workouts resulted in less muscle loss, but significant fat loss, when compared to weight loss plus walking or weight loss alone.

Losing weight is generally recommended for those with obesity, but preserving muscle - while losing fat - is particularly important for older adults in order to maximize functional benefit, Beavers said.

""Surprisingly, we found that cardio workouts may actually cause older adults with obesity to lose more lean mass than dieting alone.""

Loss of lean mass could have important consequences given the high risk of physical disability among the growing population of older adults.

The findings:

+ Total fat loss was much greater when participants combined diet plus walking (about 16 pounds) and diet plus weight training (about 17 pounds). Diet alone resulted in about 10 pounds of fat lost over 18 months.

+ Muscle mass loss was greatest with diet plus walking (about 4 pounds) compared with diet alone or diet plus weight training (each about 2 pounds). Put another way, the percentage of weight loss coming from muscle mass was 20% in the weight loss plus walking group, 16% in the weight loss alone group, and 10% in the weight loss plus weight training group.

+ Loss of fat was associated with faster walking speed, while loss of muscle was associated with reduced knee strength.

These results may be even more important for older adults who gain and lose weight with frequency, because seniors typically don't regain muscle - they regain fat mass - which is ""all the more reason for older adults to try and preserve muscle mass during weight loss,"" Beavers said.

This is the latest study from the Cooperative Lifestyle Intervention Program (CLIP-II), a single-blind, randomized controlled trial. The participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: a weight-loss-only group, who followed a calorie-restricted diet with no exercise regimen; a weight loss plus cardio (i.e., walking) group; and a weight loss plus weight-training group.

"Researchers say erenumab is ‘incredibly important step forward’ for condition that affects 8.5 million people in UK

This article is more than 1 year old

This article is more than 1 year old

A new migraine drug that can halve the length of attacks has been hailed as “the start of real change” in how the condition is treated.

Erenumab, a laboratory-made antibody that blocks a neural brain pathway called CGRP, is the first drug in 20 years proven to prevent migraine attacks.

Phase three trial data on nearly 1,000 patients showed that it typically cut between three and four “migraine days” per month. In half the patients treated, migraine duration was reduced at least by half.

Migraines could be caused by gut bacteria, study suggests Read more

Migraines are characterised by an intense, throbbing headache, sensitivity to light and noise, nausea, vomiting, low energy, and visual disturbances. Attacks can last anything from four to 72 hours.

Each year more than 8.5 million people in the UK are thought to experience migraine – more than the number affected by asthma, diabetes and epilepsy combined.

The condition is linked to depression and sick days caused by migraine are estimated to cost the UK economy more than £2bn per year.

The trial, called Strive, compared patients taking erenumab for six months with others given a non-active placebo dummy drug.



The research revealed that by months four to six, at least a 50% reduction in mean migraine days per month was achieved for just over 43% of patients injected under the skin with 70-mg of erenumab each month, while half of patients injected with the higher dose of 140-mg had such results. However, those given a placebo also saw benefits, with 26.6% of participants in this group experiencing such a reduction.



Lead investigator Prof Peter Goadsby, from King’s College hospital, London, said: “Strive … represents an incredibly important step forward for migraine understanding and migraine treatment.”

The findings, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, clearly showed that blocking the CGRP pathway could reduce the impact of migraine, he said. “The results of Strive represent a real transition for migraine patients from poorly understood, re-purposed treatments, to a specific migraine-designed therapy.”

Simon Evans, chief executive of the charity Migraine Action, said: “Migraine is too often trivialised as just a headache when, in reality, it can be a debilitating, chronic condition that can destroy lives. The effects can last for hours, even days in many cases.

“An option that can prevent migraine and that is well tolerated is therefore sorely needed, and we hope that this marks the start of real change in how this condition is treated and perceived.”



“Broadly speaking I think this is a very interesting study and I think it is a good step forward for the field and I think it is a good day for migraine sufferers,” said professor Zameel Cader, Director of the Oxford Headache Centre who was not involved in the research, pointing out that the results were on a par with currently available therapies for migraine.

“Placebo responses [in migraine studies] are quite high and I think that is partly due to the subjective nature of pain and because of the strong psychological effects that being treated have on that experience of pain and those symptoms,” he said, adding that injections generally result in an even stronger placebo effect than tablets.



Cader said that he too was looking at running trials using antibodies, and said he was excited about the approach since it might result in fewer side effects than current therapies, and would mean individuals would not have to remember to take a table every day.

“This is probably the first example of a migraine preventing drug that was rationally designed, rather than serendipitously found,” he added.

Amgen and Novartis, the codevelopers of erenumab, funded the trial, while Amgen also supplied the drug and conducted the data analyses."

"Then, last year, Konduros enrolled in a clinical trial, receiving an experimental gene therapy at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Almost immediately, he began producing the missing clotting factor. Several weeks later, after he dropped a heavy box on his shin, he watched a bruise develop and shrink within hours. “Are you kidding me?” he thought. “Life's easy if this is what happens.”

Konduros, 53, who runs a bakery and cafe in southeastern Ontario, is one of 10 men in an early-stage trial sponsored by Spark Therapeutics. (The disorder is much more common in men than women.) On Wednesday, researchers reported that a single intravenous infusion of Spark's novel gene therapy enabled patients to safely produce sufficient clotting factor to prevent dangerous bleeding episodes.

AD

AD

The treatment also “nearly universally eliminated” the need for preventive infusions of clotting factor a few times a week, the scientists said. And its effects lasted; after a year and a half, the longest patient follow-up, the therapy was continuing to work.

The results, published Wednesday online in the New England Journal of Medicine, represent “another example of the gene-therapy renaissance,” Matthew Porteus, a pediatrician at Stanford University, wrote in an accompanying editorial. He said the data suggests that the treatment ultimately might provide an “ideal cure” for hemophilia B.

Still, he noted, the study has some limitations. The follow-up period was relatively short, from 28 to 78 weeks in the new report; longer-term studies are needed to prove safety and effectiveness over extended periods. In addition, he said, researchers need to find ways to provide the therapy to a broader group of people, including children, and to figure out how to reduce the costs involved.

AD

AD

The researchers presented earlier findings on the gene therapy a year ago at the American Society of Hematology's annual meeting, but the latest data covers a larger patient group and a longer time period.

The hemophilia gene therapy is one of several being tested for conditions including sickle cell anemia and Huntington's disease. The one-time treatments seek to fight the disease by adding correct copies of a patient's defective genes. If approved, such treatments are expected to command stratospheric prices. For example, a separate Spark gene therapy for a rare type of childhood blindness, which is on track for Food and Drug Administration clearance soon, could cost $1 million per patient for infusions in both eyes, according to some Wall Street analysts.

Still, the therapies can produce at least some offsetting savings. Porteus noted in his editorial that the hemophilia therapy resulted in savings of about $200,000 a year per patient because of the elimination of clotting-factor infusions.

AD

Other experts also were impressed by the results. The hemophilia study “is small but very promising, and it gives me the sense that gene therapy for hemophilia B is going to be at our disposal in no time, maybe a few years from now,” said Aric Parnes, who is associate director of the Boston Hemophilia Center at the Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center and wasn't involved in the study. “One of the key things is, how long will the treatment last? Does it wane over time? So far, with a full year, it doesn’t look like that is happening.”

Lindsey George, the lead investigator and a hematologist at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said that nine of the 10 men in the trial didn't experience any bleeding episodes after the gene therapy treatment. The one patient who needed clotting factor because of bleeding used 91 percent less than before, she said.

“People were planning their lives around hemophilia, and now they are doing activities that they weren't before,” George said. “One man who came in a wheelchair is now out of a wheelchair and is coaching Little League.”

AD

AD

People with hemophilia B inherit a gene mutation on the X chromosome that interferes with their ability to produce normal levels of blood-clotting factor IX. (Because women have two copies of the X chromosomes, the other one can compensate, so they may carry the disease but not suffer from it.) Bleeding episodes — which can result from injury or occur spontaneously — can cause extensive damage and be life threatening.

The therapy developed by Spark, a biotech company spun off from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in 2013, involves a bioengineered gene designed to prompt the body to produce increased levels of a different clotting factor. The gene is transported to the liver, where clotting factor is made, by a harmless virus called an adeno-associated viral vector. For the current trial, which is being funded by Spark and Pfizer, researchers used a clotting factor that is 8 to 10 times as strong as the normal version. The stronger factor is called Factor IX-Padua, because it was discovered in 2009 in an Italian family.

Patients produced clotting-factor levels that were enough to allow blood to clot but not to spur an undesirable immune-system response, the researchers said.

"(Reuters Health) - Leaving a bedroom door or window open may help people sleep better, a study from the Netherlands suggests.

Open windows and doors helped reduce carbon dioxide levels and improve ventilation and air flow, which was related to better sleep quality for the healthy young adults in the study.

“We spend nearly a third of our life in the bedroom environment, but the air quality in our sleeping environment is often overlooked,” said study author Dr. Asit Mishra of Eindhoven University of Technology.

“Imagine this - you are in a confined space and have limited ability to adjust the situation (since you are asleep) while you are possibly surrounded by pollutants,” he told Reuters Health by phone. “This is how things are in bed, covered under duvets or a blanket.”

For one night of the study, 17 volunteers slept with an open window or internal door. On another night, the windows and door to the room were kept closed. In the meantime, Mishra and colleagues monitored carbon dioxide levels, temperature, background noise and humidity. The study participants were asked not to drink alcoholic beverages or caffeinated drinks, which could influence sleep. They each slept alone, and the bedroom layout with furniture arrangement was kept consistent.

For measuring sleep quality, participants wore an armband that measures skin temperature, heat flux, bed temperature and skin moisture levels. They also wore a sensor that tracked their movements at night, including indications of restlessness.

Closed environments tended to have less background noise – but they also had significantly higher carbon dioxide levels, which indicated lower ventilation levels.

Open conditions were slightly cooler than closed, although humidity levels were similar across settings, according to the report in the journal Indoor Air.

Notably, carbon dioxide levels were lower when windows or doors were open.

Overall, skin temperature and the bed temperature were higher in closed conditions than open conditions. The number of awakenings and sleep efficiency improved as carbon dioxide levels decreased.

“Opening an internal door can be a reasonably good alternative if you don’t want to open windows, either for noise concerns or security concerns,” Mishra said.

A limitation of the study is that the motion sensor often slipped off the sleepers at night.

“Sleep quality is affected by many factors, such as health and emotional states, bedding conditions and different environmental conditions, including noise levels and temperature,” said Dr. Nuno Canha of the University of Lisbon in Portugal. Canha, who wasn’t involved with this study, researches indoor air quality and sleep during different ventilation patterns. He is also part of LIFE Index-Air, a European research group that focuses on human exposure to pollutants.

In a recent study, Canha and colleagues found that closed doors and windows led to higher levels of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and other substances such as formaldehyde.

“Sleep is essential to our life in several areas: health, well-being and productivity,” Canha told Reuters Health by email. “The exposure we are under while asleep is continuous . . . and we should play it safe in order to breathe better air during sleep.”

TUESDAY, Dec. 12, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Physical activity appears to help people with lymphoma survive their disease.

That finding comes from a new study by Mayo Clinic researchers of nearly 4,100 people with lymphoma, a cancer that starts in the white blood cells that normally help fight infection.

""As physicians, we recommend physical activity for all cancer survivors to improve overall quality of life, but we did not know if physical activity would have an impact on survival in lymphoma patients,"" said study author Dr. Priyanka Pophali, a hematologist at Mayo Clinic.

""Our findings show that physical activity can have a positive impact on survival in lymphoma patients,"" she said in a Mayo news release.

Through periodic questionnaires, the researchers tracked the participants' physical activity levels from before their cancer diagnoses until three years afterwards.

People whose physical activity was greater than normal before diagnosis were less likely to have died from lymphoma, or from any other cause, than were those who'd been less active, the study found.

People who'd boosted their physical activity level after being diagnosed with lymphoma also were less likely to have died in that three-year span than were those who hadn't increased their activity level.

But the study couldn't prove that more exercise actually caused death risk to drop.

On the other hand, people whose physical activity level had declined after their diagnosis had higher death rates from lymphoma and other causes than those who had not changed their level of physical activity.

""Importantly, our study shows a survival benefit in patients who increase their level of physical activity,"" Pophali said. ""Therefore, since physical activity behaviors can be modified, physicians should counsel patients and survivors on the importance of physical activity and encourage them to maintain and, if possible, increase their level of physical activity.""

The study was presented Monday at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology in Atlanta. Research presented at meetings should be considered preliminary because it has not been subjected to the rigorous scrutiny given to research published in medical journals.

"The spread of some sexually transmitted infections could potentially be dramatically reduced by instructing people who have had unprotected sex to take antibiotics within 24 hours after the intercourse, a new study suggests.

But such a strategy, which was tested in a population of men who had frequent unprotected sex with a number of male sex partners, could spark a controversy over the use of antibiotics and the general threat of growing antibiotic resistance.

“My message with that study would be that we need to do more research to prevent STIs — because that’s a concern. And this strategy … could potentially be used,” said Dr. Jean-Michel Molina, head of infectious diseases at Saint-Louis Hospital in Paris and the lead author of the study.

advertisement

Molina insisted he would never support long-term use of antibiotics to prevent STIs, but said that the approach might be an effective short-term strategy when paired with other control approaches, like more frequent STI testing among high-risk populations.

“I don’t want this strategy to be used widely in any person, clearly,” Molina said. “But if you can select a group with a high incidence rate of syphilis or chlamydia, and you want to try to reduce the rate of syphilis quite quickly in this group of people, you may think that this strategy could be used for a couple of months.”

Rates of syphilis in particular have risen steadily in recent years; the rate in 2015-2016 — 8.7 cases per 100,000 people — was the highest since 1993, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. The rate of infection increased in every age group over the age of 15, in both men and women, and in all ethnic groups.

Molina’s study was recently published by the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was one of its funders.

The researchers randomly assigned 232 men to one of two groups. One of the groups was given antibiotics — the drug doxycycline — to take if they had unprotected sex. They were told to take two pills per encounter, and no more than six in a week, ideally within 24 hours and no later than 72 hours after the intercourse. In reality, the median use among the men was about 6.8 pills per month.

The men were tested regularly for STIs, and in the nine or so months they were followed, the rates of some sexually transmitted infections fell dramatically in the treatment group. The overall reduction of all STIs was 47 percent, but that average was dragged down by the fact that doxycycline doesn’t cure gonorrhea.

There was, however, a 70 percent reduction in chlamydia infections and cases of syphilis decreased by 73 percent. The authors noted, however, that the study length was short and they can’t tell if the strategy would work as well over the long term.

The results can’t be taken in isolation, others experts warned. Using doxycycline this way could drive the bacteria that cause the infections to develop resistance to the drug, warned Dr. Brad Spellberg, an infectious diseases specialist and chief medical officer at the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center in Los Angeles.

Spellberg also said people who used the drug this way would be exposing the bacteria they have in their gastro-intestinal tracts — their own gut flora — to regular doses of doxycycline. And those bacteria too could develop resistance to the drug, leading to a host of other health problems.

“You’re causing friendly fire injury,” he said.

The full picture of the knock-on effects of exposing your gut flora to antibiotics is still coming into focus, said Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics, and Policy and a leading voice on the dangers of mounting antibiotic resistance. He noted a recent report in the journal Science revealed that some cancer immunotherapy drugs worked less well in people who had recently taken antibiotics.

Molina noted that antibiotic resistance to doxycycline has not been seen in chlamydia or syphilis, despite the fact that the drug has been used to treat these infections for decades. Still, he said the possibility it could arise cannot be discounted.

A commentary published with the study argued that reducing infection rates in men who have sex with men and who are highly sexually active might lower STI infection rates more generally in a community.

Authors Christopher Fairley and Eric Chow, of Australia’s Melbourne Sexual Health Center at Monash University, said pressure from patients to be given doxycycline on a preventative basis might be substantial, given that the drug is also prescribed in six-month courses to treat acne. Like Molina and his co-authors, they said STI preventive use at this point is premature.

Laxminarayan did not dismiss the notion of this type of use out of hand, however. “I certainly think that for a small subset of the population, if this helps prevent syphilis, then it certainly is worth exploring further,” he said.

But he said additional studies should be conducted first to try to get a better picture of the potential consequences of using doxycycline this way, including the risk of resistance developing, the potential that it might further erode condom use, and any other unintended consequences."

"Could A Zap To The Brain Derail Destructive Impulses?

Picture this: While reaching for the cookie jar — or cigarette or bottle of booze or other temptation — a sudden slap denies your outstretched hand. When the urge returns, out comes another slap.



Now imagine those ""slaps"" occurring inside the brain, protecting you in moments of weakness.

In a report published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Stanford neuroscientists say they've achieved this sort of mind-reading in binge-eating mice. They found a telltale pattern of brain activity that comes up seconds before the animals start to pig out — and delivering a quick zap to that part of the brain kept the mice from overindulging.

Whether this strategy could block harmful impulses in people remains unclear. For now the path seems promising. The current study used a brain stimulation device already approved for hard-to-treat epilepsy. And based on the new findings, a clinical trial testing this off-the-shelf system for some forms of obesity could start as early as next summer, says Casey Halpern, the study's leader and an assistant professor of neurosurgery at Stanford. He thinks the approach could also work for eating disorders and a range of other addictive or potentially life-threatening urges.

As a physician-researcher, Halpern specializes in deep brain stimulation (DBS), a surgical treatment in which battery-powered implants send electrical pulses to brain areas where signals go awry.

The Food and Drug Administration has approved DBS therapy for movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, tremor and dystonia — usually in people who haven't responded well to medications. Occasionally DBS is a last-resort treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

Another study published Monday in PNAS suggests that DBS could help boost memory and other research is exploring its use for substance abuse and other reward-seeking behaviors.

Years ago, the Stanford team developed a mouse model to test if DBS could curb overeating. Granted, mice don't normally gorge themselves. Yet if offered fattier, tastier chow each day for just an hour, within 10 days the mice realize if they ""don't eat this now, that guy's coming back to take it away,"" Halpern says. So the animals learn to binge.

But when the researchers applied DBS stimulation to a part of the brain's reward circuit known as the nucleus accumbens, the mice quit stuffing themselves.

Trouble is, the moderation wore off in a few days, and the DBS also interfered with the animals' social behavior. That got Halpern thinking about a newer system — one that doesn't stimulate continuously, like DBS, but switches on briefly only after sensing a trouble signal, much like a pacemaker monitors and responds to abnormal heart rhythms.

In 2013, the FDA approved a newer-generation device, known as a responsive neurostimulation system (RNS), that does just that. Implanted within the brain, it senses early epileptic seizures and slows their spread with small zaps to the onset area. The RNS system costs around $40,000. But with medical devices, Halpern says, hospitals pay for the hardware and insurance companies often cover the surgery, if clinical trial data are good and the treatment is FDA approved. In the current study, Halpern and coworkers tested the RNS device in the binging mice.

First, they looked for a biomarker — an electrical blip that appears in the brain just before the animal reaches for fatty food. Next, the researchers programmed the stimulator to deliver a 10-second pulse whenever it detects this biomarker. They rigged some mice to this intermittent stimulator. For comparison, other animals got continuous DBS stimulation or random pulses.

The intermittent system controlled overeating much better than the continuous or random protocols — and nearly as well as in a separate group of mice that got zapped manually by a researcher watching their behavior on video. Plus, the treatment seemed specific to the food addiction. It did not affect anticipation associated with normal behaviors such as meeting a new mouse.

The results point to a real-time biomarker for impulsive behavior, says Dennis Turner, a Duke University neurosurgeon who was not involved in the study but wrote an October review about ongoing research on a range of potential brain stimulation biomarkers. ""That's the clear novelty.""

Figuring out if this biomarker would also work in people is challenging. Few are willing to undergo brain surgery for the purpose of research. But Halpern had a rare opportunity. One of his patients developed OCD so debilitating that he opted for DBS. He agreed to have his brain recorded during the surgery. Since food isn't allowed in the operating room, the researchers monitored the patient's brain as he anticipated payoffs in a computerized money-making task. As reported in the PNAS paper, the characteristic anticipatory signal appeared when he expected to make $5 but not for smaller sums, suggesting some level of specificity.

Of course, it's hard to conclude much from a single subject. But from other research ""we know it's safe to place an electrode in the nucleus accumbens, it's safe to stimulate it electrically, and we expect to be able to tune [the electrode] as we already do with DBS. So it seems like a nice opportunity,"" says Halpern, noting that addictive disorders haven't had new therapies for decades. ""I'm motivated by the clinical need.""

Could A Zap To The Brain Derail Destructive Impulses?	2017-12-18 06:00:00	https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/12/18/571679556/could-a-zap-to-the-brain-derail-destructive-impulses	story_reviews_00130	true
"It's no secret that many people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder may gravitate towards cigarette smoking. Many experts indicate that there is an association between people with the disorder and the desire to light up.

Dr. Jeffrey Newcorn, professor of psychiatry and director of the Division of ADHD and Learning Disorders at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, says that there is indeed a relationship between ADHD and smoking. ""People with ADHD are at somewhat of an increased risk to abuse drugs,"" he says, adding that the drug they're more likely to resort to is nicotine because of its role in modulating the neurotransmission of dopamine in the brain.

People with ADHD don't produce as much dopamine – a neurotransmitter linked to the ability to regulate emotional response – as someone without the disorder. Dopamine is also associated with feelings of reward and pleasure. Research has found a connection between ADHD symptoms and lowered dopamine levels, or issues with the efficiency of the brain's dopamine receptors.

Newcorn explains that through the years there have also been some schools of thought that people with ADHD have a harder time quitting the habit. This ultimately drove researchers to think about developing a nonstimulant alternative in the form of a drug that safely mimics the effects of nicotine. However, he says that this hasn't yet panned out.

Instead, what has gained more attention, Newcorn says, is research about any possible roles ADHD stimulant medications may play in helping someone with the disorder quit, or at least reduce nicotine use. ""There has been and continues to be a lot of interest in this area,"" Newcorn says.

More About Smoking Less, Not Stopping Completely

According to Scott H. Kollins, professor and vice chair for research in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Duke University School of Medicine, there isn't a concrete ""yes"" or ""no"" to the question of whether ADHD stimulants can help an ADHD person quit. In fact, he says that rather than this being an issue of quitting the habit altogether, it appears that the focus is more about ADHD stimulants' role in possibly lessening the number of cigarettes smoked.

In fact, Kollins was involved in a study – published in the Journal of Attention Disorders – that touched on this very subject. The journal states that ""our findings suggest that among adult regular smokers with ADHD who are interested in quitting, LDX does not increase the probability of smoking cessation more than does placebo, but is associated with a significant overall reduction in the amount of cigarettes smoked and is effective for reducing ADHD symptoms."" LDX stands for lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, an ADHD stimulant more commonly known by the brand name Vyvanse.

In this and other related research Kollins has been involved with, he says that overall, ""stimulants don't necessarily help people with ADHD quit smoking; people don't really improve any greater than with a placebo."" However, he states that ""the people taking ADHD stimulants smoked less compared to those taking a placebo.""

Kollins also points out that this study yielded results comparable other research on the topic. In fact, the LDX study notes that ""findings from this study are consistent with another published trial of osmotic-release methylphenidate in adult smokers with ADHD, which reported no effects of the stimulant drug on smoking cessation outcomes, but reductions in cigarettes smoked/day and significant drug-placebo differences in ADHD symptoms across the study (Winhusen et al., 2010)."" Concerta is an example of an osmotic-release methylphenidate.

All of this begs the question: What is it about ADHD stimulant medication that may produce this effect? Kollins explains that ""stimulants do similar things from a pharmacologic perspective as nicotine"" suggesting that taking such medication may replace the urge to light up as frequently. Treatment with stimulants may put ""the urge to smoke in check more,"" he speculates.

The Road Ahead

Such research isn't to say that taking ADHD stimulants will automatically make a person with the disorder ease up on their habit. ""You certainly couldn't say that stimulants could be used for smoking cessation in people with ADHD,"" Newcorn says. ""On the other hand, stimulants are an appropriate treatment for people with ADHD whether they smoke or not."" He explains that currently, thinking about stimulants in terms of helping people with ADHD with smoking cessation means ""talking about something off-label"" – in other words, not for intended use despite the fact that certain positive outcomes may arise by taking it.

But Newcorn adds that there may be ""reasonable strategies"" such as limiting a medication to a specific group of people and within a specific class of medication. For example, he explains that Wellbutrin, an antidepressant, and Zyban, a drug to help a person stop smoking, are the same drug, but they are marketed for different things. ""Many studies show that Wellbutrin could have a positive effect for people with ADHD,"" he says, making the point that sorting through such labeling and marketing intricacies could play a role in further exploration on the topic."

"If taking more vitamin and mineral supplements is part of your plan for a healthier new year, a new study may prompt you to reconsider.

Researchers who scoured the medical literature for evidence that calcium and vitamin D pills could help prevent bone fractures came up empty.

Their analysis focused on adults older than age 50 who lived on their own (that is, not in a nursing home or other type of residential care facility). Fractures are a serious health concern for this population — previous studies have found that about 40% of women in this age group will wind up with at least one “major osteoporotic fracture” at some point in their lives, and that among adults who break a hip, 20% died within a year of their injury.

The researchers, led by Dr. Jia-Guo Zhao of Tianjin Hospital in northeastern China, combed through clinical trials, systematic reviews and other reports published in the last decade, since late 2006. They identified 51,145 people who were included in studies assessing the role of calcium and/or vitamin D in preventing bone fractures.

Their findings appear in Tuesday’s edition of the Journal of the American Medical Assn.

Among the 14 trials that pitted calcium supplements against either a placebo or no treatment, there was no statistically significant relationship between use of the mineral (in pill form) and the risk of suffering a hip fracture. Nor was there any clear link between calcium supplements and fractures involving the spine or other bones.

Even when the researchers accounted for each study participant’s gender, past history of bone fractures, the amount of calcium they consumed in their diets and the dose of the calcium pills they took (if they did), there was still no sign that supplements were helpful.

An additional 17 trials examined the role of vitamin D, which helps the body absorb calcium. Once again, they found no statistically significant link between supplement use and hip fracture risk. Ditto for fractures in the spine and elsewhere.

Upon drilling down to certain subgroups, they found that for people who started out with at least 20 nanograms of vitamin D per milliliter of blood, adding more vitamin D through supplements was associated with a greater risk of hip fractures. The same was true for people who took high doses of vitamin D supplements just once a year.

Finally, there were 13 trials involving people who took a combined calcium-vitamin D supplement. As before, there was no statistically significant link between supplement use and the risk for any kind of fracture or combination of fractures. That held up even when accounting for gender, past fractures, supplement dose, dietary calcium or baseline blood levels of vitamin D.

The researchers noted that thousands of people in this final group were participants in the Women’s Health Initiative, a long-term study sponsored by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in the U.S. Earlier reports based on data gathered by the Women’s Health Initiative found that calcium and vitamin D supplements were associated with a lower risk of fractures, but only for women who took hormone therapy after menopause. To get a clearer picture of the direct link (if any) between supplements and fracture risk, Zhao and his colleagues opted not to include data from women on hormone therapy.

It’s still possible that calcium and vitamin D supplements are useful for people who live in nursing homes or other residential facilities, the study authors wrote. Such people are more likely to have osteoporosis, due to a combination of poor diet, less sun exposure (which the body needs to synthesize vitamin D) and other factors.

But for older adults who live on their own, they wrote, the results are clear: “These findings do not support the routine use of these supplements.”

Kale and other leafy vegetables may make your brain seem 11 years younger"	Do you take calcium and vitamin D to protect your bones? A new study says it doesn't help	2017-12-26 06:00:00	https://web.archive.org/web/20171227030848/http://beta.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-vitamins-bone-fractures-20171226-story.html	story_reviews_00128	true
"WASHINGTON -- Consuming soy foods (such as soy milk, tofu and edamame) and cruciferous vegetables (such as cabbages, kale, collard greens, bok choy, Brussels sprouts, and broccoli) may be associated with a reduction in common side effects of breast cancer treatment in breast cancer survivors, say a team of scientists led by Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center.

In the study, published in Breast Cancer Research and Treatment, higher intake of cruciferous vegetables and soy foods were associated with fewer reports of menopausal symptoms. Higher soy intake was also associated with less reported fatigue. The breast cancer survivors studied included 173 non-Hispanic white and 192 Chinese Americans including US-born Chinese and Chinese immigrants.

Researchers say breast cancer survivors often experience side effects from cancer treatments that can persist months or years after completion of treatment. For example, because many treatments designed to prevent breast cancer recurrence inhibit the body's production or use of estrogen, the hormone that can fuel breast cancer growth, breast cancer patients often experience hot flashes and night sweats, among other side effects.

The lead author on the study, Sarah Oppeneer Nomura, PhD, of Georgetown Lombardi, said that while further research is needed in larger study populations and with more detailed dietary data, this project addresses an important gap in research on the possible role of lifestyle factors, such as dietary habits, in relation to side effects of treatments.

""These symptoms can adversely impact survivors' quality of life and can lead them to stopping ongoing treatments, she says. ""Understanding the role of life style factors is important because diet can serve as a modifiable target for possibly reducing symptoms among breast cancer survivors.""

When study participants were evaluated separately by race/ethnicity, associations were significant among white breast cancer survivors; however; while a trend was seen in the benefit for Chinese women, results were not statically significant. Researchers explain Chinese women typically report fewer menopausal symptoms. Most of them also consume cruciferous vegetables and soy foods, making it difficult to see a significant effect in this subgroup. Indeed, in this study, Chinese breast cancer survivors ate more than twice as much soy and cruciferous vegetables.

Whether the reduction in symptoms accounts for longtime use of soy and cruciferous vegetables needs further investigation, says the study's senior author, Judy Huei-yu Wang, PhD, of Georgetown Lombardi's Cancer Prevention and Control Program.

Results obtained in preclinical studies in animals show that biologically active compounds present in both soy and cruciferous vegetables cause breast cancer cells to grow, but have opposite effects in animals that consume these compounds well before cancer is diagnosed and continue consuming them during and after cancer treatments.

Until more research is conducted, breast cancer patients should not suddenly start eating soy, if they have not consumed it before, says Leena Hilakivi-Clarke, PhD, a professor of oncology at Georgetown Lombardi and a co-author of the study.

Researchers also found suggestive associations with lower reporting of other symptoms, including joint problems, hair thinning/loss and memory less in women who consumed more soy foods, but these associations did not reach statistical significance.

Phytochemicals, or bioactive food components, such as isoflavones in soy foods and glucosinolates in cruciferous vegetables may be the source of the benefit, researchers say. Isoflavones bind to estrogen receptors and exert weak estrogenic effects, among other effects. Glucosinolates in cruciferous vegetables influence levels of metabolizing enzymes that can modulate inflammation and levels of estrogen, possibly attenuating treatment-related symptoms.

Soy, cruciferous vegetables associated with fewer common breast cancer treatment side effects	2017-12-29 06:00:00	https://web.archive.org/web/20171211074415/https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-12/gumc-scv120817.php	news_reviews_00134	true
"Community screening for osteoporosis could prevent more than a quarter of hip fractures in older women, according to new research.

A new study, published in The Lancet, has shown that a simple questionnaire, combined with bone mineral density measurements for some, would help identify those at risk of hip fracture.

The research, involving more than 12,000 older women and carried out in collaboration between the universities of Birmingham, East Anglia, Bristol, Leicester, York and Sheffield, found that screening through GP practices allowed patients to be targeted for treatment. In women agreeing to participate, this led to a 28 per cent reduction in hip fractures over five years.

Professor Neil Gittoes, of the University of Birmingham's Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research, said: ""Our findings showed that screening led to a statistically significant decrease in hip fractures. ""Our data has the potential to influence national policies around prevention of hip fractures, which is particularly relevant in our ageing society. The consequences of hip fractures to older people can be devastating, including impaired mobility and loss of independence. ""While we have demonstrated clinical effectiveness of screening, we are also exploring cost-effectiveness of this approach; initial analyses also look promising in this respect.""

Professor Lee Shepstone, from UEA's Norwich Medical School, said: ""Approximately one in three women and one in five men aged over 50 year will suffer a fragility fracture during their remaining lifetime. In the UK around 536,000 people suffer fragility fractures each year, including 79,000 hip fractures.

""A hip fracture can be devastating with a loss of independence and less than one third of patients make a full recovery. Mortality at one-year post-fracture is approximately 20 per cent.""

""We wanted to find out whether screening, like screening for breast cancer, could help identify those at risk of suffering a fracture.""

The team used a University of Sheffield developed tool called FRAX, which predicts the probability of a hip fracture or a major osteoporotic fracture (a hip, spine, upper arm or lower arm fracture), to identify older women at high risk.

A total of 12,483 women aged 70-85 were recruited from 100 GP practices in seven regions -Birmingham, Bristol, Manchester, Norwich, Sheffield, Southampton, and York. Half of the women were screened to compare screening with routine care.

Among those screened, treatment was subsequently recommended for one in seven women deemed at high risk of hip fracture. This recommendation was acted upon by the women and their GPs so that over three quarters of the women at high risk were on osteoporosis medications within six months of screening.

While screening did not reduce the incidence of all osteoporosis-related fractures, there was strong evidence for a reduction in hip fractures.

In the screening group, there were 54 fewer women who suffered one or more hip fractures compared to the routine care group.

The study suggests that one hip fracture could be prevented for every 111 women screened and early analysis suggests the approach is likely to be cost-effective.

Professor Shepstone added: ""This is the first trial to show that a community-screening approach based on the FRAX fracture risk tool is both feasible and effective. Given that the number of costly and debilitating hip fractures are expected to increase with an ageing population, the results of this study potentially have important public health implications.""

Professor Eugene McCloskey, of the University of Sheffield, said: ""Low-cost screening with FRAX among the older population could result in effective, targeted intervention to reduce the human and socioeconomic burden of hip fractures.

""If the SCOOP screening strategy was taken up in exactly the same way as in the study in all UK women aged 70-85 years, we estimate that the strategy could prevent up to 8000 hip fractures per year in the UK. Even greater gains could be made if we could reach out to women similar to those who did not take part in the study.""

The randomised controlled trial 'SCreening for Osteoporosis in Older women for the Prevention of fracture' (SCOOP) was funded by the Medical Research Council and Arthritis Research UK.

Dr Natalie Carter, head of research liaison and evaluation at Arthritis Research UK, said: ""Ten of thousands of people a year present with hip fractures in the UK. As well as significantly increasing mortality, a hip fracture can stop a person's ability to live independently, with 43% no longer being able to walk independently in the year after the fracture. ""We welcome this community based screening programme and any other research that reduces the likelihood of fractures.""

"Scientists and health professionals gush about the benefits of exercise in study after study, and new research from the American Academy of Neurology is no exception.

The organization updated its guidelines for those with mild cognitive impairment Wednesday, and published them online in Neurology. The condition – which people develop as they age – involves issues with thinking and memory. It affects more than 6 percent of people in their 60s, and it increases to 37 percent for those age 85 and older.

Among the guidelines:

Doctors should tell people with mild cognitive impairment to exercise consistently, as six-month studies have indicated exercising twice a week could improve memory.

Medical professionals can suggest cognitive training for people, though the evidence isn't strong that this could be beneficial for improvement.

Mild cognitive impairment should not be confused with dementia – mild cognitive impairment comes with milder symptoms – though evidence has shown it can escalate to that point. Those with dementia may have trouble with daily tasks like getting dressed and making meals, but with mild cognitive impairment, people tend to have more difficulty than others their age remembering things like appointments or where they keep their car keys, the Los Angeles Times reports.

The guidelines note that no Food and Drug Administration-approved medications exist for mild cognitive impairment treatment, nor are high-quality, long-term studies in the works that imply drugs or dietary changes could aid people who have the condition."

"FINDINGS

Gene expression in specific cells and in specific regions can provide a more precise, neuroprotective approach than traditional treatments for neurological diseases. For multiple sclerosis, specifically, increasing cholesterol synthesis gene expression in astrocytes of the spinal cord can be a pathway to repair nerves that affect walking.

BACKGROUND

Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune, neurodegenerative disease, characterized by distinct disabilities affecting walking, vision, and cognition, to name a few. MS patients differ markedly from each other regarding which disability affects them the most. Inflammation strips the myelin coating from nerve cell extensions, called axons, and connections at the ends of nerves, called synapses, are lost, together disrupting signaling and eventually causing permanent disability depending on where this occurs. UCLA researchers proposed that molecular mechanisms behind each disability may differ, and that neuroprotective treatments tailored for each disability may be more effective than nonspecific treatments aiming to reduce a composite of different disabilities. The team focused on astrocytes, a type of brain cell that becomes activated in MS and plays several important roles in disease, examining gene expression in astrocytes in different regions.

METHOD

Working with a mouse model of MS, the research team assessed astrocytes in various regions of the brain and spinal cord known to be involved in walking, vision or cognition. They compared gene expression changes between regions that correspond to different disabilities. In the spinal cord - an area that's critical for walking -- they found a decrease in the expression of cholesterol synthesis genes. Cholesterol does not leave the blood and enter the brain, instead it is made in astrocytes and plays a role in making myelin, the nerve coating, and synapses, the nerve connections. They hypothesized that while inflammation causes loss of myelin and synapses, it is the decrease in cholesterol synthesis gene expression in astrocytes that explains why lesions do not repair in MS. They treated MS mice with a drug that increased expression in cholesterol synthesis genes - and this resulted in improved walking ability.

IMPACT

This disability-specific discovery approach represents a strategy for finding neuroprotective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases that are tailored to repair damage for each disability, one at a time, in contrast to a ""one size fits all"" treatment approach.

"Children who eat fish at least once a week sleep better and have IQ scores that are 4 points higher, on average, than those who consume fish less frequently or not at all, according to new findings from the University of Pennsylvania published this week in Scientific Reports, a Nature journal.

Previous studies showed a relationship between omega-3s, the fatty acids in many types of fish, and improved intelligence, as well as omega-3s and better sleep. But they've never all been connected before. This work, conducted by Jianghong Liu, Jennifer Pinto-Martin and Alexandra Hanlon of the School of Nursing and Penn Integrates Knowledge Professor Adrian Raine, reveals sleep as a possible mediating pathway, the potential missing link between fish and intelligence.

""This area of research is not well-developed. It's emerging,"" said Liu, lead author on the paper and an associate professor of nursing and public health. ""Here we look at omega-3s coming from our food instead of from supplements.""

For the work, a cohort of 541 9- to 11-year-olds in China, 54 percent boys and 46 percent girls, completed a questionnaire about how often they consumed fish in the past month, with options ranging from ""never"" to ""at least once per week."" They also took the Chinese version of an IQ test called the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised, which examines verbal and non-verbal skills such as vocabulary and coding.

Their parents then answered questions about sleep quality using the standardized Children Sleep Habits Questionnaire, which included topics such as sleep duration and frequency of night waking or daytime sleepiness. Finally, the researchers controlled for demographic information, including parental education, occupation and marital status and number of children in the home.

Analyzing these data points, the Penn team found that children who reported eating fish weekly scored 4.8 points higher on the IQ exams than those who said they ""seldom"" or ""never"" consumed fish. Those whose meals sometimes included fish scored 3.3 points higher. In addition, increased fish consumption was associated with fewer disturbances of sleep, which the researchers say indicates better overall sleep quality.

""Lack of sleep is associated with antisocial behavior; poor cognition is associated with antisocial behavior,"" said Raine, who has appointments in the School of Arts and Sciences and Penn's Perelman School of Medicine. ""We have found that omega-3 supplements reduce antisocial behavior, so it's not too surprising that fish is behind this.""

Pinto-Martin, who is executive director of Penn's Center for Public Health Initiatives, as well as the Viola MacInnes/Independence Professor of Nursing and a professor of epidemiology in Penn Medicine, sees strong potential for the implications of this research.

""It adds to the growing body of evidence showing that fish consumption has really positive health benefits and should be something more heavily advertised and promoted,"" she said. ""Children should be introduced to it early on."" That could be as young as 10 months, as long as the fish has no bones and has been finely chopped, but should start by around age 2.

""Introducing the taste early makes it more palatable,"" Pinto-Martin said. ""It really has to be a concerted effort, especially in a culture where fish is not as commonly served or smelled. Children are sensitive to smell. If they're not used to it, they may shy away from it.""

Given the young age of this study group, Liu and colleagues chose not to analyze the details participants reported about the types of fish consumed, though they plan to do so for work on an older cohort in the future. The researchers also want to add to this current observational study to establish, through randomized controlled trials, that eating fish can lead to better sleep, better school performance and other real-life, practical outcomes.

For the moment, the researchers recommend incrementally incorporating additional fish into a diet; consumption even once a week moves a family into the ""high"" fish-eating group as defined in the study.

""Doing that could be a lot easier than nudging children about going to bed,"" Raine said. ""If the fish improves sleep, great. If it also improves cognitive performance -- like we've seen here -- even better. It's a double hit.""

"(Reuters Health) - People who drink hot tea daily may be less likely than others to develop glaucoma symptoms, U.S. researchers say.

Compared to coffee, soft drink and iced tea drinkers, study participants who consumed a cup or more of hot caffeinated tea daily had 74 percent lower odds of having glaucoma, the study authors report in the British Journal of Ophthalmology.

“Glaucoma can lead to blindness, and it would be great if it could be prevented because there is no cure,” said lead author Dr. Anne Coleman of the University of California, Los Angeles.

“The best way to prevent it is to get your eyes checked,” Coleman told Reuters Health in a telephone interview. “But we are also interested in lifestyle habits and what we can do to make a difference.”

Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide, according to the World Health Organization, affecting an estimated 58 million people. That includes more than three million Americans, only half of whom are aware they have the disease, according to the Glaucoma Research Foundation.

Coffee, or caffeine in general have previously been linked to increased glaucoma risk, although recent studies don’t agree, Coleman and her colleagues write.

To evaluate the relationship between specific caffeinated drinks and glaucoma, Coleman and colleagues analyzed data on a sample of more than 10,000 people in the U.S. who were representative of the entire population. Participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey during 2005-2006 answered questions about their diets and lifestyles, had medical exams and blood tests and also underwent eye examinations.

About 1,700 participants were over age 40, had no other known eye diseases and had full eye examination results from the survey. In this group, Coleman’s team found that just over 5 percent, 82 people, had glaucoma.

Almost half of participants reported drinking coffee often, but less than 10 percent drank hot tea daily. The research team found no associations between coffee, iced tea, decaffeinated tea or soft drink consumption and the likelihood of having glaucoma.

“Tea drinkers should keep drinking and don’t need to stop because of a fear of glaucoma,” Coleman said. “This makes sense, but we’ll see if it holds up in future studies.”

Future studies should look at the habits, activities and nutrition that affect lifestyle and glaucoma risks, said Idan Hecht of Tel-Aviv University in Israel, who wasn’t involved in the research.

“In the past few years, there has been a tremendous increase in interest, and subsequently research, into the ways lifestyle changes can influence diseases,” Hecht told Reuters Health by email.

Recent research indicates that vitamins C, E and zinc can help vision. Other studies indicate that antioxidants in tea could have similar effects, he noted.

“Patients can and should be involved and take an active role in the management of their ailments,” Hecht said. “Exercising, eating healthy and trying novel ways to improve your health is something you should definitely explore and bring up with your physician.”

Environmental factors could play a role in glaucoma risk as well, said Dr. Ahmad Aref at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

“As our population grows older, we need to think about the other factors that could help, particularly when it comes to the health benefits of physical activity,” he told Reuters Health by phone.

Overall, both medical and non-medical approaches are key to treating the disease in the future, Aref added.

“It’s a tough disease because we don’t have a way to bring vision back once it’s lost,” he said. “All we can do is prevent it from getting worse, and we want to help patients do that.”

"Story highlights Luxturna, a one-time treatment, corrects a genetic mutation that can lead to blindness

Spark Therapeutics set the price for the gene therapy at $425,000 per eye

(CNN) A one-time treatment with Luxturna, the first US Food and Drug Administration-approved gene therapy for an inherited disorder, will cost $425,000 per eye.

Spark Therapeutics Inc., the Philadelphia-based maker of voretigene neparvovec, announced Wednesday in a statement that it reached an agreement in principle with Harvard Pilgrim and affiliates of Express Scripts to make the one-time treatment available to patients with a rare genetic defect that often leads to blindness.

The mutation affects both eyes, usually at the same pace, so most patients would need treatment for both eyes, a Spark Therapeutics spokeswoman said.

In some cases, the gene therapy will be available under an ""outcomes-based rebate arrangement."" The company also stated that its proposal to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the government program that covers about 100 million Americans, would allow installment payments for the drug.

""For a one-time therapy, like Luxturna, a non-traditional payment and distribution model is necessary to ensure needs of all parties -- patients, payers and providers -- are addressed,"" said Jennifer Luddy, a spokeswoman for Express Scripts.

"Bariatric Surgery Helps Teens With Severe Obesity Reduce Heart Disease Risk

Enlarge this image toggle caption Roos Koole/Getty Images Roos Koole/Getty Images

After three years, teens with severe obesity who underwent stomach reduction surgery to lose weight also significantly improved their heart health.

A study published Monday in Pediatrics shows that blood pressure, cholesterol, inflammation and insulin levels all improved, particularly among those who lost the most weight.

""The potential impact of such risk reduction translates into a reduced likelihood of developing significant heart disease later in life, including atherosclerosis, heart failure and stroke,"" says study author Marc Michalsky, surgical director of the Center for Healthy Weight and Nutrition at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, in an email. ""This study serves to reinforce the benefits of bariatric surgery as a safe and effective treatment strategy that should be considered sooner rather than later.""

Younger adolescents in the study showed bigger improvements in their cholesterol and inflammation levels than the older teens. Even participants who had normal-range blood pressure, triglycerides or cholesterol levels before surgery saw improved measures.

Nearly a third of all children and teens are overweight or obese in the U.S., and an estimated 4 to 7 percent have severe obesity. The greater a person's obesity, the greater their risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes and organ damage.

The findings are important because many of the participants in this study likely already had some level of cardiac damage, such as thickened arteries or heart walls, says Geetha Raghuveer, a pediatric cardiologist at Children's Mercy Kansas City in Missouri who was not involved in the study.

""If you have very high blood pressure or lipids [cholesterol] or diabetes, you do see cardiovascular changes even at a very young age,"" Raghuveer says. ""They may not be having a heart attack or stroke in their teens and 20s, but they're closer to having those in their 30s and 40s.""

Among 242 teens in the study, 161 of them underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure, 67 underwent a vertical sleeve gastrectomy and 14 received an adjustable gastric banding. The study authors had no part in which procedures the teens received. They collected data from the five participating medical centers for their observational study, and decisions about procedures depended on each center's clinical practices.

The teens, ages 15 to 18 when the study began, had a body mass index (BMI) between 34 and 88, with half over 51. Medical providers use BMI, the ratio of a person's weight to height, to estimate body fat. A BMI over 25 is considered overweight; over 30 is obese. The obesity classification with the highest risks of health problems is a BMI of 40 or higher.

The risk factors measured in the study included elevated blood pressure (above 120/80 mg/Hg), high cholesterol, high insulin levels in the blood and abnormally high levels of C-reactive protein, an indicator of inflammation in the body. The higher a person's insulin levels are, the more likely they are to have or develop insulin resistance, which can increase blood sugar levels and diabetes risk. High insulin levels may also contribute to increased blood pressure and increase the risk of atherosclerosis, when fat clogs the arteries.

Three years after surgery, teens who underwent a gastric bypass had a 27 percent drop in their BMI, similar to the 26 percent drop in those who had the sleeve gastrectomy. Those with the gastric band had an 8 percent drop in BMI.

Before surgery, only 3 percent of the teens had no cardiac risk factors at all, but three years later, just over half of them (52 percent) had no risk factors. Just 5 percent had all four cardiac risk factors before their surgeries, but none had all of them three years later. In fact, the majority of the participants — 83 percent — had only one or no risk factors three years after their surgeries. The proportion of participants with two or three risk factors also dropped substantially.

""One of the surprises was that almost all patients benefited as a result of the surgery,"" says M. James Lenhard, the medical director of Christiana Care Health System's Diabetes & Metabolic Diseases Center in Wilmington, Del., who was not involved in the study. The average BMI three years after surgery was 39, still considered very obese, he says. ""And yet they still had significant improvements in cardiovascular risk factors,"" Lenhard says. ""The results were impressive.""

The study's biggest limitation is its very selective population. Most of the participants were female, most were white, and most received the gastric bypass. Children of color have the greatest risk of obesity, heart disease and Type 2 diabetes, but it's not clear whether they would see the same improvement with these procedures. Lenhard expects the ""odds are very good"" that they would, and Raghuveer ""would be cautiously optimistic"" that the findings would be similar regardless of sex or ethnicity.

The population also included only teens with the greatest obesity who were also unsuccessful trying other weight loss methods.

""Severe obesity is notoriously difficult to treat with anything other than surgery,"" Lenhard says. ""The results of this study suggest that performing surgery at a BMI even lower than 52 would provide even better outcomes.""

An estimated 1,600 adolescents undergo metabolic or bariatric surgeries each year, the study notes, but families should only consider such procedures after exhausting other treatment options.

""This is not a procedure you would consider for any obese patient who walks through the door,"" Raghuveer says. ""It would be considered for the highly obese and those not responding to any behavioral modifications, physical activity or calorie restriction.""

Before undergoing bariatric surgery, teens and their families receive extensive counseling, Michalsky says.

""Teens considering bariatric surgery should have a frank discussion with their family and primary care provider and seek detailed information from well-established bariatric surgery centers that are specifically dedicated to treating adolescents,"" he adds.

All three procedures carry the same risks as any surgical procedure, such as infections, blood clots and bleeding, Lenhard said, and a common risk of sleeve gastrectomy is bleeding where the stomach is reconnected. People who have a gastric bypass often have nutritional and vitamin deficiencies, Lenhard said. And gastric banding has low effectiveness and a risk of the band slipping down the stomach.

Getting longer term data is important, too. Three years is a good follow-up time for this type of study, and it has many more participants than similar studies.

""However, three years is not a long time overall in the life of a child,"" Raghuveer says. ""I'd be curious what happens to these kids at 10 years, 15 years later.""

Michalsky says the study is ongoing, and they expect to continuing gathering information for years to come.

Ideally, public health efforts should aim for better obesity prevention, including parent education and interventions when children are toddlers and preschoolers, according to Raghuveer. ""A generational divide"" has left fewer families knowing how to fix meals, she says, and more families need to learn to cook and avoid packaged foods and microwave dinners.

""The big question is, how do we prevent obese kids from getting to this point where they would need an invasive surgical procedure?"" Raghuveer says. ""The bigger message should be that we should get to a point in society where we are not managing obesity, but we are preventing obesity.""

"A scientifically based approach that includes a tooth-decay risk assessment, aggressive preventive measures and conservative restorations can dramatically reduce decay in community dental practices, according to a study by researchers at UC San Francisco.

The findings, which support earlier research demonstrating positive results of the assessment and treatment method in a university setting, have the potential to transform dental care for high-risk patients at a lower cost to both patients and dental clinics and practices. Results appear online Jan. 22, 2018, in Advances in Dental Research.

""We put the 2012 UCSF clinical study into the real world and showed it works,"" said lead author Peter Rechmann, DMD, PhD, professor of preventive and restorative dental sciences in the UCSF School of Dentistry. ""The patients at high caries risk who used prescription products went down significantly over time in their risk level. Those in the control group also reduced their risk to a lesser degree, simply by using over-the-counter products that also protect teeth and affect the bacteria.""

Dental caries (tooth decay) is caused by bacteria on the tooth surface feeding on carbohydrates, then making acids as waste. These acids destroy the protective tooth enamel and the dentin layer beneath it. If not halted or reversed, this leads to a cavity.

CAries Management By Risk Assessment (CAMBRA?) is an evidence-based approach to preventing or treating dental caries at its earliest stages. It was launched in 2003 through the UCSF School of Dentistry by the paper's senior author, John Featherstone, PhD, MSc, former dean of the school and distinguished professor of preventive and restorative dental sciences.

A dentist who uses CAMBRA obtains the patient's dental and medical history and conducts a clinical exam to assess caries early enough to reverse or halt progression and to determine caries risk factors. These factors include, among other things, acid-producing bacteria, frequent eating and drinking of fermentable carbohydrates (""snacking""), and abnormally low saliva flow and function.

From this assessment, the dentist utilizes behavioral approaches and chemical treatments to optimize protective factors. The treatment plan typically incorporates remineralization through the use of fluoride and/or antibacterial therapies such as chlorhexidine and xylitol, minimally invasive restorative procedures to conserve tooth structure, and regular patient follow up.

The authors published their initial validation of CAMBRA for ages 6 through adult in 2006, followed by several additional years of data published in 2011, 2012, 2015 and 2016. Since then, more than half of the U.S. schools and colleges of dentistry have adopted CAMBRA in one form or another as part of their standard curriculum. The authors said now that this has been shown to be effective in a non-academic clinical setting, there also is potential for insurance companies to reimburse CAMBRA and other preventive therapies for adults, thereby lowering patient costs while increasing profits for dental practices.

Treatment Effective Even Without Prescription Products

In the Advances in Dental Research study, Rechmann and his colleagues recruited 20 dentists - 17 in private practice, three in community clinics - to participate in a two-year CAMBRA trial of 460 patients ages 12-65 years old, with 239 in a CAMBRA group and 221 in a control group.

In the CAMBRA group, high-risk patients received prescription fluoride toothpaste, chlorhexidine antibacterial rinse, xylitol mints and fluoride varnish. The control group received regular fluoride toothpaste, an assumed inactive mouth rinse, sorbitol candies and a non-fluoride varnish.

Follow-up visits occurred at six, 12, 18 and 24 months, in which new caries lesions or changes in caries risk level were recorded. Overall, the researchers found that a significantly greater percentage of high-risk participants were classified at lower risk after receiving CAMBRA preventive therapies. Dental decay was low in both groups.

Among 242 patients (137 intervention, 105 control) initially identified as high risk for caries, only a quarter of the patients remained at high risk in the CAMBRA group at 24 months, while just over half (54 percent) of the control group did. Of the 192 low-risk participants (93 intervention, 99 control), most participants remained low risk, indicating that the assessment correctly identifies who is at risk for caries.

The researchers said the risk reduction among the control group may have been caused by the fluoride toothpaste enhancing tooth repair, as well as the mouth rinse enhancing saliva flow and having bactericidal effects. While not as significant as the CAMBRA group in this study, the risk level of these patients dropped more dramatically over time than for those in the 2012 UCSF CAMBRA study.

""It was surprising to see the benefits gained by the control group,"" Rechmann said. ""More research is needed to see if the products and treatment administered to this group function in the way we speculate, and if so, they might be made easily available to dental patients. Doing so can change the whole picture of caries control.""

Among the study limitations, the researchers noted a high study attrition (65 percent), which partly may have contributed to observed declines in risk level at each subsequent recall visit.

"LOS ANGELES, Jan. 25, 2018 -- Clot removal may be beneficial up to 24 hours following stroke in carefully selected patients, but every hour delayed after symptoms begin may be associated with more disability, according to preliminary research presented at the American Stroke Association's International Stroke Conference 2018, a world premier meeting dedicated to the science and treatment of cerebrovascular disease for researchers and clinicians.

The international DAWN trial previously demonstrated that patients with a small area of irreversible brain damage and a large area of brain at jeopardy of being lost if the clot remains are more likely to recover with minimal disability if the clot is removed up to 24 hours after symptoms begin or were noticed. It is already well-established that the benefit of clot removal declines each hour during the first 6 hours after symptoms are detected.

In the current analysis of treatment between 6 and 24 hours after symptoms were observed, or after the person was last seen to be well, researchers found:

each 1-hour delay reduces the chance of recovery with minimal or no disability by 11 percent; and

treatment remains beneficial through 24 hours, with patients who had their clots removed being 35.5 percent more likely to have minimal or no disability 90 days later, but the overall effect of treatment declines with time.

The current results demonstrate the importance of prompt imaging and treatment of patients with clot-caused stroke, even in those who wake up having experienced a stroke or who for other reasons are not identified in the first few hours after the onset of symptoms.

THURSDAY, Jan. 11, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Injecting a calcium-based cement into the bones of some people with knee or hip pain could help them avoid joint replacement surgery, Ohio State University doctors say.

The calcium phosphate cement flows into the spongy inside portion of the bone, filling in microfractures and other damaged areas, and it hardens in about 10 minutes' time, said Dr. Kelton Vasileff, an orthopedic surgeon at the university's Wexner Medical Center.

The cement braces the bruised or injured joint bone from the inside, Vasileff explained, and eventually is replaced by new bone as part of the body's natural healing process.

The procedure, called subchondroplasty, has been available to people with knee problems for years, Vasileff said. Now he and his colleagues are testing to see whether hip patients also can benefit from it.

It is much less invasive than a knee or hip replacement, and typically is performed on an outpatient basis, Vasileff said.

The procedure involves a smaller incision than joint replacement surgery, so there's less risk of infection, and a quicker recovery time that means fewer of the side effects associated with being bedridden, Vasileff said.

However, subchondroplasty is only feasible in a narrow range of patients. Those with full-blown bone-on-bone arthritis or joint pain caused by damage to the cartilage and ligaments will get little to no relief from the procedure, Vasileff said.

""People who have significant arthritis where the cartilage itself is damaged and thinned, this isn't going to fix the arthritis,"" Vasileff said. ""But there are some people who may have some issues with the bone and mild arthritis. In these patients who might otherwise have needed a knee or hip replacement to deal with that, this could be an alternative.""

Software engineer Ben Wallace underwent subchondroplasty in November to help shore up a damaged hip.

""The end of September I noticed I was really struggling to move around my left leg very well,"" said Wallace, who lives in Columbus, Ohio. Imaging scans revealed a hip in very bad shape, with a misshapen femur.

A five-hour surgery cleaned up the femur and bolstered the bone with cement.

""It's been going really great. I'm better than what they expected. One week after surgery I was off the crutches, walking on my own,"" Wallace said.

""I figured I'm going to have a fake hip in there at the age of 30, which was very depressing,"" Wallace explained. ""The fact I was able to keep all my bones and joints in there was quite a surprise.""

Subchondroplasty has shown solid potential, but orthopedic surgeon Dr. Matthew Hepinstall is concerned that it might be ""oversold"" to desperate patients who want to avoid joint replacement surgery.

""The claims that are being made are not evidence-based yet, although they are intellectually appealing,"" said Hepinstall. He is associate director of the Center for Joint Preservation & Reconstruction at Lenox Hill Hospital, in New York City.

""It's just important not to oversell this,"" he added.

The best candidates for the procedure are patients who still have some cartilage protecting their joint, but have somehow ""overloaded"" and injured the bone, causing swelling and pain, Hepinstall said.

""If you inject this substance into the bone, you're basically providing internal support, a scaffold protecting the bone. That can theoretically reduce bone pain,"" Hepinstall noted.

""The appealing thing about it is instead of going in and resurfacing a damaged joint, you're injecting something to help the bone, but keeping the patient's own anatomy,"" Hepinstall continued.

""But there's a very narrow window of patients who are good ideal candidates for this, who basically have a real overload of their bone causing severe enough pain to warrant a surgical procedure, but also have healthy enough cartilage that doing something about the bone swelling is going to alleviate the majority of their pain,"" he stressed.

""We don't want to send the message to people who have bone-on-bone, with big bone spurs and limited range of motion that they're all of a sudden going to get relief from injecting a little bit of cement into their bone,"" Hepinstall said. ""This is for people who have basically a normal joint that has normal range of motion and normal stability, just a little thinning of the cartilage.""

"SCS works by sending low electrical pulses, which vary in frequency, pulse width and amplitude, to the spinal cord to interrupt pain signals. Paresthesia-based therapy provides pain relief with a light tingling sensation while sub-perception therapy works without that sensation. With the Spectra WaveWriter System, patients can choose to combine both of these therapies to target one specific area of pain or use each therapy as needed to best manage multiple areas of pain. Patients provide real-time feedback using the system's remote control. Together, these features benefit patients by addressing each individual's unique pain relief needs.

""Patients suffering with chronic pain experience pain differently, and pain also evolves over time, sometimes causing a patient to become less responsive as the body becomes accustomed to treatment,"" said Dr. Giancarlo Barolat, neurosurgeon, Barolat Neuroscience, Denver, Colorado. ""Until now, the medical community has had limited options to offer personalized pain relief therapy to patients. The main advantage of the Spectra WaveWriter System is that it integrates multiple therapies into a single device so that treatment can more easily be tailored to individual needs.""

The Spectra WaveWriter System was developed with more than a decade of clinical research focused on optimizing sub-perception and delivering multiple therapies intended for more effective, long-term pain relief. These studies include the WHISPER study and the PROCO study. The PROCO study was a multi-center, prospective, double-blind, randomized study in which patients acted as their own control. This study established in de novo patients that similar pain relief and improvement in quality of life measures are achieved independent of the type of frequency (from 1 kHz up to 10 kHz) used in sub-perception SCS therapy when the proper target and dose are identified. The WHISPER study is a multi-center, prospective, cross-over, randomized, and controlled study evaluating the long-term safety and effectiveness of sub-perception SCS pain relief therapy.

""We are introducing industry-leading SCS technology to help provide patients with lasting relief from chronic pain,"" said Maulik Nanavaty, president and senior vice president, Neuromodulation, Boston Scientific. ""We are committed to investing in research and expanding treatment options for chronic pain by identifying new, non-opioid solutions for the millions of people suffering from this debilitating condition.""

More than 100 million Americans suffer from chronic pain and it is the number one cause of disability in adults in the U.S.1,2 SCS is a non-opioid alternative for treating chronic pain. While prescriptions for opioids have quadrupled since 1999, the amount of pain reported in the U.S. has not changed. 3

"Scientists Edge Closer To A Blood Test To Detect Cancers

Enlarge this image Andrew Lichtenstein/Getty Images Andrew Lichtenstein/Getty Images

Researchers say they have taken a step toward developing a blood test that would detect eight common cancers, possibly even before symptoms appear.

As they report Thursday in the journal Science, they're hoping their idea would eventually lead to a $500 test that can screen for cancer and identify people with the disease when it's in its earliest stages and more treatable.

But they have a long way to go.

There have been many attempts over the decades to develop blood tests to screen for cancers. Some look for proteins in the blood that appear with cancer. Others more recently have focused on DNA from tumors. But these methods alone don't give reliable results.

So Nickolas Papadopoulos, a professor of oncology and pathology at the Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, collaborated with many colleagues at the medical school to develop a new approach. It combines two methods into one test.

Their experimental test, dubbed CancerSEEK, focuses on eight major cancers: lung, breast, colon, pancreas, liver, stomach, ovary and esophagus.

""We selected those eight cancers based on how frequent they are, also [because] a lot of them do not have any screening modality right now,"" Papadopoulos says.

The researchers looked at 1,005 people who had been diagnosed with these cancers. The blood test found signs of cancer in about 70 percent of them.

They also looked at 812 people without cancer diagnoses and found just seven of them — less than 1 percent — apparently had a false reading that found cancer. A low false-positive rate is critical for any test that could be used widely to screen people for cancer.

Of course, the ultimate goal of this test is to find cancer in people who haven't already been diagnosed. And that percentage could well be lower than the 70 percent average. For example, the test was successful only about 40 percent of the time in the patients the researchers studied with the earliest stage 1 cancers.

Though 40 percent success would be far from ideal, ""we still think this is a very important milestone in detecting cancers in asymptomatic people,"" Papadopoulos says. ""That could save their life.""

""I am incredibly excited by this new paper,"" says Joshua Schiffman, an oncologist and cancer researcher at the Huntsman Cancer Center at the University of Utah who was not involved in the study. ""This is the paper that's going to set the field in motion.""

But Schiffman points out that there are many issues to work out – even assuming the test proves reliable among people who have not been previously diagnosed with cancer. For instance, if the success rate is around 40 percent at detecting cancer, that means it misses cancers more often than it finds it.

""The thing we worry about quite often is ... if we have a test result that is negative we don't want to give false reassurance to the patient,"" he says. He is concerned that patients will think to themselves, ""Even though I have this weird stomach pain that won't go away, I know it's not cancer. I'm not going to go to the doctor because the CancerSEEK test told me it was negative,"" Schiffman says. ""And that would be a terrible thing.""

Another problem is that the test results find signs of cancer, but often fail to pinpoint which part of the body is affected. ""That's a tremendous problem that has to be overcome,"" he says.

""We've come about one step in a thousand-mile journey,"" says Vinay Prasad, an oncologist and cancer researcher at the Oregon Health and Science University who was not involved in the study.

First, he notes, the Hopkins team will need to demonstrate that the test will be useful in patients without symptoms. Then the researchers will need to show that the rate of false alarms remains very low, otherwise people will be sent on needless and expensive medical odysseys.

And for the test to be useful, ""you've got to find cancer that's going to otherwise be lethal, and not cancer that would otherwise be destined to do nothing,"" Prasad says.

That's been a huge problem with previous cancer screening tests, especially for prostate cancer and breast cancer, and has led to pointless and potentially dangerous treatments, he says.

An effective screening test would hold lots of potential for cancer patients, Prasad says.

""We want this to be true, we hope that this is true, but we have learned through 30, 40, 50 years of cancer screening that we have to do the right studies at the outset to know that it's true,"" Prasad says.

The scientists at Hopkins have already launched their next study, which could involve tens of thousands of apparently healthy volunteers who are enrolled in the Geisinger Health Plan in Pennsylvania. Their experience will help answer the next big question, which is whether CancerSEEK will pick up cancer in people who don't have symptoms.

If that multiyear experiment succeeds, the researchers will still have to demonstrate that the test improves and extends the lives of cancer patients.

Papadopoulos is less concerned that the test could detect cancers that might not in fact benefit from treatment.

""In a personal level, I do want to know,"" he says. ""That doesn't mean I have to go and have a surgery. However, I still think this is very useful information, knowing that something is happening and follow it up.""

As for the cost of the test, Papadopoulos says the research team has tried hard to make it affordable. They're hoping to make it economical, so that each test could cost about $500. But he says Johns Hopkins holds the patent and has not licensed it as yet to a company that would ultimately set the price.

"Many more stroke victims than previously thought can be saved from disability or death if doctors remove blood clots that are choking off circulation to the brain, a new study has shown.

“These striking results will have an immediate impact and save people from lifelong disability or death,” Dr. Walter J. Koroshetz, director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, said in a statement. “I really cannot overstate the size of this effect.”

The key finding is that there is often more time than doctors realized in which brain cells can still be rescued by a procedure to remove the clot. Traditional guidelines have set a limit of six hours after stroke symptoms begin, and said after that it would be too late to help.

The study showed that the time window could be expanded to 16 hours. However, the findings do not apply to every stroke victim. The researchers used a special type of brain imaging to identify the patients who still had live brain tissue that could be saved if the blood supply was restored. Only about half the patients who were screened qualified for treatment, known as thrombectomy, which uses a mechanical device to pull clots out of a blood vessel."

"Many of these patients find themselves stuck with depression, cognitive problems, headaches, fatigue and other symptoms. Known as post-concussion syndrome, this phenomenon is often difficult to treat. Antidepressants can lift moods, painkillers can ease headaches and physical therapy may ease dizziness, but most researchers agree that these remedies don't heal the injury within the brain.

Could oxygen do the trick? A growing group of scientists and physicians say that hyperbaric treatment, which exposes patients to pure oxygen at higher-than-normal air pressure, may work.

""These patients don't have enough oxygen to heal the injured parts of their brains,"" said Shai Efrati, a researcher and physician at Tel Aviv University in Israel and a leading hyperbaric scientist. ""Hyperbaric treatment massively increases the amount of oxygen available to the brain.""

But other researchers believe that the treatment has no merit and should not be recommended.

""People want to believe that hyperbaric can fix [brain injuries], and it can't,"" said David Cifu, a researcher at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, who has spent much of his career treating veterans with brain injuries.

Compressed air has been used by doctors since the 17th century. In 1917, two German inventors first used pressurized pure oxygen to treat decompression sickness, which occurs when undersea divers return to the surface too quickly. For the past 50 years, hyperbaric therapy has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for non-healing wounds, carbon monoxide poisoning, burns and decompression sickness. Over the past decade, doctors in the United States and internationally have begun using it to treat mTBIs.

MTBIs include sports-related concussions and head injuries caused by traffic accidents. Also, between 2000 and 2017, 308,853 American service members suffered mild traumatic brain injuries, according to the Department of Defense.

Patients with an mTBI typically experience symptoms that include headache, dizziness, fatigue, depression, anxiety and cognitive impairment. Known as post-concussion syndrome (PCS), this phenomenon is difficult to treat. Doctors use antidepressants, pain medications, biofeedback and physical therapy, but these strategies do not always work.

The nature of the human brain makes it particularly susceptible to chronic injury. The organ requires large amounts of energy under normal circumstances, and even more to heal when injured. And often, the initial trauma damages blood vessels that supply the brain with oxygen. So, just as the brain needs extra resources, it faces an energy crisis. Often, Efrati and others say, injured brain cells don't die, but may persist for years or decades, alive but hobbled. Hyperbaric therapy, he said, can return them to full function, even years after the injury.

""Oxygen is different, because it has a direct biological effect on brain tissue,"" said Paul G. Harch, a physician in New Orleans who over the past three decades has used hyperbaric oxygen to treat hundreds of people with chronic brain injury as well as stroke.

Patients typically receive between 40 and 60 hour-long hyperbaric treatments spread over two to three months. During each treatment, they sit or lie inside a hyperbaric chamber, which varies in size from a person-size tube to a large room that can hold several patients. While in the chamber, patients breathe in pure oxygen, typically pressurized to about twice the density of sea-level air; in this environment, the lungs take in about 10 times as much oxygen as under normal conditions.

Researchers say it remains unclear how hyperbaric oxygen affects injured brains. Efrati and others argue that it probably works through several biological pathways. The extra oxygen appears to trigger the healing of brain cells, and switches on genes specifically related to brain repair. It increases the number of stem cells that migrate to sites of brain injury, promotes the growth of new blood vessels in the brain, and boosts the activity of mitochondria, which provide energy to cells throughout the body. Scientists have linked increased mitochondrial activity to healing in many kinds of tissue.

Efrati said the brain is no different from any other part of the body. Pressurized oxygen has the power to repair many kinds of tissue damage. ""A non-healing wound in the leg and a non-healing wound in the brain,"" he said, ""they are the same basic thing.""

Efrati came to the field accidentally. Eight years ago, as director of research at Assaf Harofeh Medical Center in Tel Aviv, he was asked to oversee the hospital's small hyperbaric chamber. He knew little about hyperbaric medicine and wasn't especially interested in it. But he soon noticed that pressurized oxygen seemed to have an unexpected effect. A patient had come for treatment of foot wounds that wouldn't heal — a common symptom in diabetes. The man had also suffered a traumatic brain injury several years earlier, which left him unable to speak more than a few words. The hyperbaric treatment healed his feet — and also revived his ability to speak. Other patients with wounds and brain injuries had similar surprising results. He began to examine how hyperbaric treatment affects the brain, and this work has become his focus. In 2008. Efrati founded and now directs the Sagol Center for Hyperbaric Medicine and Research at Tel Aviv University and Assaf Harofeh, where he oversees and collaborates with a range of scientists and manages a large hyperbaric treatment facility.

As the use of hyperbaric therapy for brain injury has grown, it has become increasingly controversial. Critics argue that it remains unproven and that desperate patients are wasting thousands of dollars — the treatment typically costs between $200 and $400 per session and is rarely covered by insurance — on a technique that rarely if ever helps. Between 2009 and 2015, Cifu oversaw three studies for the Department of Veterans Affairs — reportedly at a taxpayer cost of about $70 million — of about 60 active-duty service members with post-concussion syndrome. The studies found that hyperbaric treatment had little effect on their symptoms.

Overall, there is relatively little research on hyperbaric treatment for brain injury, in part because pressurized oxygen can't be patented, which limits its potential profitability. ""It's very difficult to get funding for studies on this topic,"" Harch said.

A few studies besides Cifu's have looked at humans. In a paper published in October, Efrati and colleagues examined 15 post-concussion syndrome patients who had received hyperbaric treatment. Using brain imaging, the scientists found that after treatment, the subjects had increased cerebral blood flow as well as more activity in brain areas that had previously been dormant. They say that this indicates that hyperbaric treatment triggered regeneration of nerve fibers and blood vessels in the brain. In addition, tests showed that the subjects had improved memory and processing speed. In another study, published in 2015, researchers gave hyperbaric oxygen to 56 patients with prolonged post-concussion syndrome. They found that many patients showed significant improvements in cognitive function and overall quality of life.

While the research remains inconclusive, some American doctors are using oxygen to treat chronic brain injuries.

Ziad Mirza is one of them. For most of his career, he dispensed hyperbaric treatment for hospitals around Baltimore. Two years ago, he became chief medical officer for Hyperheal Hyperbarics, a company with three clinics in the Baltimore area. Since then, he said, he has treated about a half-dozen brain-injury patients, with mostly positive results.

One of these patients is Parisa Cook, 29, who in 2016 was found to have a tennis ball-size tumor in her brain. Surgeons removed it, but the operation was not a complete success. Cook, who lives in Baltimore, began to suffer from debilitating symptoms: She had problems with her short-term memory; she had constant headaches and couldn't concentrate; her vision became blurry and dark; and her hearing was altered, so that all sounds were jumbled and very loud. Specialists told her the operation probably had caused collateral brain trauma.

Over the course of a year, she went to eight doctors and tried more than a dozen medications and a variety of other treatments. Nothing helped. A policy analyst for the Maryland Department of Health, she worried that she would have to quit her job. She began to consider suicide. ""I felt completely hopeless,"" she said.

Then Cook read about hyperbaric oxygen treatment. She got in touch with Mirza and began treatments. After a single session, she said, her vision was no longer wobbly; after 20 sessions over a month, she felt ""perfect."" ""It was a complete 180,"" she said. ""This treatment saved my life.""

Cook's primary-care doctor, Sujay Pathak, an internist in Baltimore, first saw her in February. ""Her life was totally interrupted by this. She couldn't function,"" Pathak said.

But a few weeks after starting hyperbaric therapy in September, she ""got suddenly and rather miraculously better,"" Pathak said.

Of course, such anecdotes are not the same as rigorous scientific research. Efrati agreed that hyperbaric treatment requires more research. ""Definitely, we need more science,"" he said. ""We have a lot to learn. But we are seeing the results with our patients. It works, again and again and again.""

"AUGUSTA, Ga. (Jan. 2, 2018) - In just four months, high-doses of vitamin D reduce arterial stiffness in young, overweight/obese, vitamin-deficient, but otherwise still healthy African-Americans, researchers say.

Rigid artery walls are an independent predictor of cardiovascular- related disease and death and vitamin D deficiency appears to be a contributor, says Dr. Yanbin Dong, geneticist and cardiologist at the Georgia Prevention Institute at the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University.

So researchers looked at baseline and again 16 weeks later in 70 African-Americans ages 13-45 - all of whom had some degree of arterial stiffness - taking varying doses of the vitamin best known for its role in bone health.

In what appears to be the first randomized trial of its kind, they found that arterial stiffness was improved by vitamin D supplementation in a dose-response manner in this population, they write in the journal PLOS ONE.

Overweight/obese blacks are at increased risk for vitamin D deficiency because darker skin absorbs less sunlight - the skin makes vitamin D in response to sun exposure - and fat tends to sequester vitamin D for no apparent purpose, says Dong, the study's corresponding author.

Participants taking 4,000 international units - more than six times the daily 600 IUs the Institute of Medicine currently recommends for most adults and children - received the most benefit, says Dr. Anas Raed, research resident in the MCG Department of Medicine and the study's first author.

The dose, now considered the highest, safe upper dose of the vitamin by the Institute of Medicine, reduced arterial stiffness the most and the fastest: 10.4 percent in four months. ""It significantly and rapidly reduced stiffness,"" Raed says.

Two thousand IUs decreased stiffness by 2 percent in that timeframe. At 600 IUs, arterial stiffness actually increased slightly - .1 percent - and the placebo group experienced a 2.3 percent increase in arterial stiffness over the timeframe.

They used the non-invasive, gold standard pulse wave velocity to assess arterial stiffness. Reported measures were from the carotid artery in the neck to the femoral artery, a major blood vessel, which supplies the lower body with blood. The American Heart Association considers this the primary outcome measurement of arterial stiffness.

When the heart beats, it generates a waveform, and with a healthy heart and vasculature there are fewer and smaller waves. The test essentially measures the speed at which the blood is moving, and in this case, fast is not good, Raed says.

""When your arteries are more stiff, you have higher pulse wave velocity, which increases your risk of cardiometabolic disease in the future,"" says Raed.

The varying doses, as well as the placebo participants took, were all packaged the same so neither they or the investigators knew which dose, if any, they were getting until the study was complete. Both placebo and supplements were given once monthly - rather than daily at home - at the GPI to ensure consistent compliance.

Dong was also corresponding author on a study published in 2015 in the journal BioMed Central Obesity that showed, in this same group of individuals, both 2,000 and 4,000 IUs restored more desirable vitamin D blood levels of 30 nanograms per milliliter.

The 4,000 upper-limit dose restored healthy blood level quicker - by eight weeks - and was also better at suppressing parathyroid hormone, which works against vitamin D's efforts to improve bone health by absorbing calcium, they reported.

While heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, blacks have higher rates of cardiovascular disease and death than whites and the disease tends to occur earlier in life. The authors write that arterial stiffness and vitamin D deficiency might be potential contributors.

While just how vitamin D is good for our arteries isn't completely understood, it appears to impact blood vessel health in many ways. Laboratory studies have shown that mice missing a vitamin D receptor have higher activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, says Raed. Activation of this system increases blood vessel constriction, which can contribute to arterial stiffness. Vitamin D also can suppress vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, activation of garbage-eating macrophages and calcification formation, all of which can thicken blood vessel walls and hinder flexibility. Vitamin D also reduces inflammation, an underlying mechanism for obesity related development of coronary artery disease, says Raed.

Now it's time to do a larger-scale study, particularly in high-risk populations, and follow participants' progress for longer periods, Dong and Raed say. ""A year would give us even more data and ideas,"" Raed adds.

Dong notes that pulse wave velocity and blood pressure measures are complimentary but not interchangeable. ""We think maybe in the future, when you go to your physician, he or she might check your arterial stiffness as another indicator of how healthy you are,"" Raed says.

There were no measurable differences in weight or blood pressure measurements over the 16-week study period.

The Institute of Medicine currently recommends a daily intake of 800 IUs of vitamin D for those age 70 and older. For adolescents and adults, they recommend 4,000 IUs as the upper daily limit; 2,000 was a previous upper limit.

More than 80 percent of Americans, the majority of whom spend their days indoors, have vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency. Dong, an expert in vitamin D and a professor in the MCG Department of Population Health Sciences, says about 15 minutes daily in the ""young"" sun - between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. - but before your skin starts to get pink, is the best source of vitamin D.

Foods like milk, milk products like cheese and yogurt, fatty fish like mackerel and sardines, some greens like kale and collards and fortified cereals also are good sources. The researchers say a vitamin D supplement is an inexpensive and safe option for most of us.

"Patients gave universally positive feedback about the app's ease of use and the ability to have wounds monitored

CHICAGO (Jan. 19, 2017): A new smartphone app called WoundCare is successfully enabling patients to remotely send images of their surgical wounds for monitoring by nurses. The app was developed by researches from the Wisconsin Institute of Surgical Outcomes Research (WiSOR), Department of Surgery, University of Wisconsin, Madison, with the goal of earlier detection of surgical site infections (SSIs) and prevention of hospital readmissions. The study results appear as an ""article in press"" on the website of the Journal of the American College of Surgeons ahead of print.

SSIs are the most common hospital-acquired infection and the leading cause of hospital readmission following an operation.1,2,3 Due to the prevalence off SSIs, the WiSOR research team decided to see if postoperative wound monitoring could be effectively achieved by having patients upload photos through the WoundCare app and answer a few brief questions to gather information not easily captured through images.

""Patients cannot identify [infections] and frequently ignore or fail to recognize the early signs of cellulitis or other wound complications,"" study authors wrote. ""This drawback leads to the common and frustrating scenario where patients present to a routine, scheduled clinic appointment with an advanced wound complication that requires readmission, with or without reoperation. However, the complication may have been amenable to outpatient management if detected earlier.""

Forty vascular surgery patients were enrolled in the study. There was an overall data submission rate of 90.2 percent among participants, and submissions were reviewed within an average of 9.7 hours. During the study, seven wound complications were detected and one false negative was found.

""We set out to come up with a protocol where patients could become active participants in their care and allow us to be in closer communication and monitor their wounds after they leave the hospital,"" said lead study author and general surgery resident Rebecca L. Gunter, MD. . ""This approach allows us to intervene at an earlier time rather than waiting for patients to come back in after the problem has already developed past the point of being able to manage it on an outpatient basis.""

Patients were enthusiastic about the app's ease of use and the reassurance they felt having their wounds regularly monitored. The nurse practitioners responsible for reviewing the submitted images attested to the value of the photos and patient satisfaction, although they also noted it was difficult to find time to review the submitted images on top of an already heavy clinical workload. Study authors note that the success and sustainability of a post-discharge wound-monitoring protocol requires a dedicated transitional care program and not simply adding a task to the current staff workload.

This protocol also has a cost-savings component, in addition to the patient safety and satisfaction aspects. Study authors note that SSIs are the most expensive hospital-acquired infection, costing an average of nearly $30,000 per wound-related readmission and an estimated $3-10 billion annually.

""If you could imagine saving the cost from the number of patients whose readmission you were able to prevent, that result could provide significant savings to the health system,"" Dr. Gunter said. Although capturing specific numbers related to cost-savings was not part of this study, Dr. Gunter said it is an important area of focus for future studies.

A limitation to telemedicine protocols that call for the use of smartphones is that not every patient has the necessary technology or knowledge to upload images on their own. The WiSOR research team addressed this issue by having participants undergo tailored training to learn to use the WoundCheck app. They provided each patient with an iPhone 5S and an accompanying visual reference guide to further assist in using the phone and app. Dr. Gunter said they were very successful in giving patients knowledge and access to technology so they could participate in the study. She said this is a model easily adaptable to other medical centers, whether through providing participants with a phone, having a rotating supply of phones at the hospitals for patients to borrow, or relying on a patient's personal device.

""We have demonstrated that a population of complex and high-risk patients, many of whom are older adults and novice smartphone users, can complete this protocol with high fidelity and satisfaction,"" the researchers concluded.

"Bottom Line: Obese patients who underwent weight-loss surgery had a lower rate of death from any cause compared with obese adults who received nonsurgical care to manage their obesity.

Why The Research Is Interesting: Much is known about the short-term outcomes of bariatric surgery for weight loss but relatively little is known about its long-term effects. Some previous research has been limited by a number of factors, including the lack of a comparison group of obese patients who did not undergo bariatric surgery.

Who and When: 8,385 obese patients in Israel who underwent bariatric surgery (laparoscopic banding, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy) from 2005-2014; 25,155 obese patients who received nonsurgical care for obesity management from primary care physicians that may have included dietary counseling and behavior modification.

What (Study Measures): Bariatric surgery (exposure); death from any cause (outcome)

How (Study Design): This is a retrospective cohort study that used data from the past to compare obese patients who had bariatric surgery with those who didn't and death from any cause. The study is observational. Because researchers are not intervening for purposes of the study they cannot control for all the natural differences that could explain study findings.

Authors: Orna Reges, Ph.D., Clalit Health Services, Tel Aviv, Israel and coauthors

Results: The rate of death from any cause over about 4.5 years was lower among obese patients who underwent bariatric surgery compared with patients who managed their obesity with nonsurgical care.

Study Limitations: Imbalances caused by matching groups of obese patients for comparison based on age, sex, body mass index and diagnoses of diabetes.

Study Conclusions: The association between bariatric surgery and a lower rate of death from any cause adds to the limited literature describing the beneficial outcomes of these surgical procedures for obese patients.

"January 30, 2018 - For older women undergoing mastectomy for breast cancer, direct-to-implant (DTI) breast reconstruction provides good outcomes in a single-step procedure, while avoiding some of the inconvenience and risks of staged approaches to breast reconstruction, reports a study in the February issue of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery®, the official medical journal of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS).

""The DTI approach is a powerful tool for breast reconstruction in elderly patients,"" comments ASPS Member Surgeon Andrea Moreira, MD, of the Cleveland Clinic. The researchers believe the DTI technique may expand the options for older women, who are less likely to undergo breast reconstruction.

Good Results with DTI Breast Reconstruction in Women over 65

Direct-to-implant breast reconstruction has emerged as a single-stage approach to immediate breast reconstruction after mastectomy. So far, however, most studies of DTI have focused on younger women.

""Half of all breast cancers occur in women over 65, yet only four to 14 percent of these women undergo reconstruction,"" Dr. Moreira and coauthors write. Most studies of breast reconstruction in older women have focused on multiple-step techniques such as tissue expander implant (TEI) reconstruction.

The researchers identified women over age 65 who underwent DTI reconstruction at the Cleveland Clinic between 2012 and 2015. They identified a total of 24 breasts reconstructed by DTI in 19 patients, all with at least 30 days' follow-up and most with one year of follow-up

Patient characteristics and outcomes were compared to those of 109 breasts with TEI reconstruction in 98 patients. The women undergoing DTI reconstruction were older (73.5 versus 69.2 years) and had a higher body mass index, compared to the TEI group.

Both DTI and TEI were safe and effective options for breast reconstruction. Complication rates were similar between groups, including blood and fluid collections (hematoma and seroma), infection, unplanned surgery, and failed reconstruction.

However, DTI had some important advantages. Women in the DTI group were less likely to be readmitted to the hospital and spent fewer total days in the hospital. In the year after surgery was completed, women in the DTI group made an average of 6.5 office visits, compared to about 12 visits in the TEI group.

The DTI group also spent fewer days with a surgical drain in place: average about 13 days, compared to 23 days in the and had fewer total days in the hospital. That's an important consideration, as drains require antibiotic treatment to prevent infection, in addition to causing discomfort for the patient.

The authors note some important limitations of their study--particularly the fact that it was a review study of one hospital's experience with a relatively new procedure. Dr. Moreira and colleagues write, ""These reported cases include our learning curve patients as we familiarized ourselves with appropriate patient selection and surgical technique.""

The researchers emphasize that DTI isn't an option for every patient, depending on breast shape and other factors. Despite these limitations, their experience suggests that complications of the DTI approach in older women are similar to those of the more commonly used TEI technique. Dr. Moreira adds, ""In appropriately selected cases, DTI reconstruction is a viable alternative to staged techniques requiring multiple surgeries.""

Direct-to-implant breast reconstruction provides good results in older women	2018-01-29 06:00:00	https://web.archive.org/web/20180131002245/https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-01/wkh-dbr013018.php	news_reviews_00116	true
"PROVIDENCE, R.I. [Brown University] -- New results from a clinical trial involving more than 900 military veterans at high risk for keratinocyte carcinoma skin cancer provides evidence that using the generic skin cream fluorouacil 5 percent for two to four weeks may reduce the risk of a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) needing surgery by 75 percent within a year.

The finding that less than one month's use of fluorouacil 5% (5-FU) appeared to prevent cancer for up to a year is encouraging, said lead author Dr. Martin A. Weinstock, a professor of dermatology in the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University and chief of dermatology at the Providence Veterans Affairs Medical Center.

The dose is the same as dermatologists currently employ to treat actinic keratosis. In a 2015 study, Weinstock and co-authors showed the up to four-week regimen of 5-FU had a multi-year preventive benefit in reducing the number of actinic keratosis (AK) and the need for treatment. Earlier this year, they also showed that the medicine prevents new AKs from emerging for two to three years.

Meanwhile, current means for preventing new carcinomas in high-risk patients -- sunscreen or oral medications -- cease to work as soon as they are no longer used. But in the new study, 5-FU appeared to provide prolonged protection after discontinuation and could be combined with sunscreen, Weinstock said.

In the absence of such a long-lasting prevention option, he said, the typical approach to caring for patients with a history of prior carcinomas is to monitor for the next cancer and then remove it surgically -- an effective but imposing strategy often called ""wait and cut.""

""People don't appreciate having stuff cut on their face a lot,"" said Weinstock, who led the trial funded by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and conducted at a dozen V.A. hospitals around the country. ""They do it if there is a cancer there, but we want to take a proactive approach where we can give them something to reduce their risk of getting new cancers.""

The new results are published in JAMA Dermatology.

The VAKCC trial

Between 2009 and 2013, the Veterans Affairs Keratinocyte Carcinoma Chemoprevention Trial randomly assigned 932 veterans who each had at least two prior basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) or SCCs to either receive the 5-FU cream or a cream just like it but without the active ingredient as an experimental control. All of the veterans were instructed to apply their cream twice a day to their face and ears for up to four weeks. They also received a 30 SPF sunscreen and received education about skin cancer, sunscreen and sun safety.

The two groups were both almost exclusively white and male, and they averaged 71 years of age. The experimental and control groups were very similar along all other measured characteristics, including their self- reported degree of prior sun exposure and sunburn. Veterans typically have spent a large amount of time in the sun during their years of service.

Both groups went to their V.A. center twice a year for two to four years for follow-up exams with a dermatologist. Neither the veterans nor the examining dermatologists knew who received 5-FU and who received the placebo.

Some reduced risks

After the first year, 20 of the 464 veterans in the control group developed a squamous cell carcinoma that required surgery, but only five of the 468 veterans who got 5-FU did, a statistically significant 75 percent reduction in the risk, according to the study. For the subsequent three years, there was no longer a significant difference between the two groups in the number of patients who required surgical treatment for an SCC.

For BCCs, there was an 11 percent reduced risk after the first year among the group that received 5-FU, but that difference was not statistically significant. In the second year, BCC cases requiring surgery rose in the 5-FU group, but in years three and four, and by the end of the study, there was no significant overall difference in risk of developing a BCC requiring surgical treatment. After four years, 298 of all study the participants had developed at least one BCC, and 108 had developed at least one SCC.

The study did show a significant decrease in the risk of needing Mohs surgery to treat a BCC in the first year. Mohs surgery is more effective but also more elaborate and expensive than a conventional procedure, Weinstock said. In the study's first year, 36 BCCs were treated with Mohs surgery in 27 participants in the control group, but only 17 BCCs were treated with the procedure among 14 patients in the 5-FU group.

""This suggests that using the 5-FU can reduce the resources needed to treat these carcinomas,"" Weinstock said.

The cream does have common side effects including reddened, more sensitive and often crusty skin, effects that resolve when the application of the cream stops, Weinstock acknowledged. After the study's first six months, 21 percent of the 5-FU group rated the side effects as ""severe,"" and 40 percent rated them as ""moderate.""

But after six months and again at the end of the four-year trial, 87 percent of participants in the 5-FU group said they'd be willing to repeat the treatment if it proved effective in reducing skin cancer.

In his clinical work, Weinstock said that for particularly high-risk patients, he has recommended 5-FU treatment. Based on the study results, it could be that patients need to renew their regimen with the cream every year.

""The most remarkable thing about this study is that now we have something to use that doesn't lose its effectiveness when you stop using it,"" Weinstock said. ""But this is the first study of its type. I'm hopeful there will be other studies that show other sorts of regimens that last longer and do a better job over time as science progresses. This is an important first step.""

He and colleagues are planning further studies, including one to determine the cost-effectiveness of 5-FU treatment.

"January 2, 2018 - In addition to reducing headache frequency and severity, surgical treatment for migraine leads to significant improvements in everyday functioning and coping ability, according to a study in the January issue of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery®, the official medical journal of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS).

""Our study demonstrates the high functional disability experienced by migraine patients, compared to those with other pain conditions, "" comments ASPS Member Surgeon William Gerald Austen, Jr, of Massachusetts General Hospital. ""The results also show that migraine surgery can lead to dramatic improvements in functioning and coping ability, even in patients who are very disabled before surgery.""

Standard Pain Assessments Show Functional Improvement after Migraine Surgery

Surgery has become recognized as an effective treatment option for selected patients with chronic, severe migraine headaches who do not respond to standard treatments. Developed by plastic surgeons who noticed that some migraine patients had fewer headaches after cosmetic forehead-lift, migraine surgery procedures address trigger sites linked to certain headache patterns.

However, most studies evaluating migraine surgery have relied on migraine-specific questionnaires. ""Pain questionnaires used in the evaluation of better-understood and more common pain syndromes have not been applied to migraine surgery,"" Dr. Austen and coauthors write.

The study evaluated the performance of one such questionnaire--the Pain Self Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ)--in migraine surgery patients. The PSEQ has been used to study treatment outcomes in patients with a wide range of pain conditions. It provides information not only on pain scores, but also on functional disability and ability to cope with pain when performing normal daily activities.

The study included 90 patients who underwent migraine surgery, performed by Dr. Austen, between 2013 and 2015. Before and after surgery, patients were evaluated on a standard migraine questionnaire (the Migraine Headache Inventory, or MHI) and on the PSEQ. The final analysis included 74 patients who completed both questionnaires at one-year follow-up after migraine surgery.

Before migraine surgery, the patients had ""extremely poor"" PSEQ scores, indicating a high level of disability. Preoperative pain coping scores in migraine patients were substantially lower than reported for patients with other types of chronic pain--for example, neuropathic (related to nerve damage) pain, arthritis, or lower back pain.

One year after migraine surgery, the patients had a very large percent improvement in average PSEQ score: on average, 112 percent higher than baseline. That was much higher than in studies of patients with other types of chronic pain: for example, an average 19 percent improvement after nonsurgical treatment for low back pain.

Migraine surgery improved functioning and coping even in patients with very low initial PSEQ scores. That's in contrast to patients with musculoskeletal problems such as low back pain, in whom low PSEQ scores predict poor treatment outcomes.

""It seems that migraine surgery patients can recover function and ability to cope with pain very well after surgery, in stark contrast to what has been shown in other pain conditions,"" Dr. Austen and coauthors write. They note that surgery also led to an average 76 percent improvement in the migraine-specific MHI score, measuring outcomes like headache frequency, duration, and severity.

The new study shows ""continued positive outcomes"" after migraine surgery in appropriately selected patients, including large improvements in migraine-related disability. Dr. Austen and colleagues conclude, ""Chronic pain questionnaires such as the PSEQ add to our understanding of functional outcome after surgery and put pain in migraine surgery patients in perspective to better-known pain conditions.""

Migraine surgery produces 'dramatic improvements' in functioning, study finds	2018-01-29 06:00:00	https://web.archive.org/web/20180102211701/https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-01/wkh-msp010218.php	news_reviews_00127	fake
"Cancer cells can be destroyed more effectively and selectively with a unique new reusable treatment, activated with a substance found in stinging nettles and ants - thanks to new research by the University of Warwick.

Cancer cells can be destroyed more effectively and selectively with a unique new reusable treatment, activated with a substance found in stinging nettles and ants - thanks to new research by the University of Warwick.

Led by Professor Peter J. Sadler from Warwick's Department of Chemistry, researchers have developed a new line of attack against cancer: an organic-osmium compound, which is triggered using a non-toxic dose of sodium formate, a natural product found in many organisms, including nettles and ants.

Named JPC11, it targets a metabolic process which cancer cells rely on to survive and multiply. It does this by converting a key substance used by cancer cells to provide the energy they need for rapid division (pyruvate) into an unnatural lactate - leading to the cells' destruction.

Uniquely, this chemo-catalyst treatment can be recycled and reused within a cancer cell to attack it repeatedly.

This unprecedented functional ability to recycle and reuse the compound within cancer cells could lead to future anticancer drugs being administered in smaller, more effective, and potentially less toxic doses - decreasing the side-effects of chemotherapy.

The researchers have been focusing on the potential to use this compound on ovarian and prostate cancers.

Ovarian cancers are becoming increasingly resistant to existing chemotherapy drugs (such as the platinum drug, cisplatin). Since this new research functions in a totally new and unique way, it may overcome this acquired resistance and widen the spectrum of anticancer activity.

Importantly, the development opens up a possibility for a more selective cancer treatment as JPC11 was observed to specifically target the biochemistry of cancer cells, leaving healthy cells largely untouched - another improvement compared to existing platinum-based drugs, which can also attack non-cancerous cells.

Dr James Coverdale, a Research Fellow from Warwick's Department of Chemistry, commented:

""This is a significant step in the fight against cancer. Manipulating and applying well-established chemistry in a biological context provides a highly selective strategy for killing cancer cells.

""We have discovered that chemo-catalyst JPC11 has a unique mechanism of action - and we hope that this will lead to more effective, selective and safer treatments in the future.""

Professor Peter Sadler, a medicinal chemist at the University of Warwick commented:

""Platinum compounds are the most widely used drugs for cancer chemotherapy, but we urgently need to respond to the challenges of circumventing resistance and side-effects. Our lab is focussed on the discovery of truly novel anticancer drugs which can kill cells in totally new ways. Chemo-catalysts, especially those with immunogenic properties, might provide a breakthrough.

""It will take time to progress from the lab to the clinic, but we are fortunate to have a talented enthusiastic, international team working with colleagues in Warwick Cancer Research Centre across the borderlines of chemistry, cell and systems biology and cancer medicine who are determined to succeed.""

Professor Martin Wills, catalyst specialist at the University of Warwick, commented:

""Although asymmetric catalytic hydrogenation processes are well developed in the materials industry, this research provides the first ever example of it being achieved inside cells using a synthetic catalyst.""

Handedness (molecular asymmetry) is critical to the function of bio-molecules in the body. Proteins, enzymes and our DNA, for example - are handed. Only the correct hand works, in the same way that a right hand does not fit a left-hand glove.

In this case, the osmium compound JPC11, with sodium formate, can selectively produce a molecule of a specific 'handedness' - thus manipulating how cancer cells grow.

Dr Coverdale explained:

""The 'handedness' of molecules is critical in the body. Our hands are near-identical, but are mirror images of each other. The same can be true of molecules, and in some cases, having the wrong handed molecule can have profound biological consequences.

""We believe that manipulation of the 'handedness' of molecules in cells could provide a new strategy for fighting diseases.""

"URBANA, Ill. - Nearly every American who has become a parent in the last decade has heard the slogan, ""breast milk is best,"" and has likely been encouraged to offer breast milk to newborns. Among other things, breast milk contains natural sources of prebiotics: small, indigestible fiber molecules that promote the growth of good bacteria in the baby's gut. Yet for many families, breastfeeding is difficult or impossible. Fortunately, modern infant formulas are getting closer to the real thing with the help of University of Illinois researchers.

In a recent study from the Piglet Nutrition and Cognition Lab at U of I, scientists worked with piglets to show prebiotics included in infant formula can enhance memory and exploratory behavior.

""When we provide prebiotics in formula, our results confirm that we can not only benefit gut health, which is known, but we can also influence brain development,"" says Ryan Dilger, associate professor in the Department of Animal Sciences, Division of Nutritional Sciences, and Neuroscience Program at U of I. ""We can actually change the way piglets learn and remember by influencing bacteria in the colon.""

Piglets are widely considered a more informative model for human infants than mice and rats; their digestive systems, behavioral responses, and brain development are remarkably similar to human infants. Therefore, researchers are increasingly turning to piglets to test hypotheses in pre-clinical trials related to human health, especially in the context of gut microbes and brain development.

""There hasn't been a lot of work looking at the gut-brain axis in humans, but a lot of rodent work is showing those connections. This is taking it to an animal model that is a lot closer to human infants and asking if that connection still exists and if we can tease out possible mechanisms,"" says Stephen Fleming, lead author of the study and a doctoral student in the Neuroscience Program at U of I.

In early 2016, Dilger and his colleagues worked with piglets to show that a combination of innovative formula components, including prebiotics, may play a role in brain development and behavior. In their new study, the team concentrated solely on the effects of prebiotics.

Starting on the second day of life, piglets were given a cow's milk-based infant formula supplemented with polydextrose (PDX), a synthetic carbohydrate with prebiotic activity, and galactooligosaccharide (GOS), a naturally occurring prebiotic. When the piglets were 25 days old, Fleming took them through several learning, memory, and stress tests. After 33 days, blood, brain, and intestinal tissues were collected for analysis.

The test for learning and memory gave piglets a chance to play with dog toys: one they'd seen before and one brand-new toy. If they spent more time with the new toy, that was an indication that the piglet recognized it as new and preferred it. This ""novel object recognition"" test improves on classic maze tests commonly used in rodent studies.

""If you're trying to test for memory, this test is closer to what we'd do with an infant. After all, we don't generally train infants on mazes,"" Fleming says. ""We know from previous research this test works for pigs, but this is the first published example of using it in a nutrition context.""

Pigs fed PDX and GOS spent more time playing with new objects than pigs who didn't receive the prebiotic supplements. The preference for novel objects, an indication of natural curiosity, is a sign of healthy brain development and points towards positive development of learning and memory.

When prebiotics are working the way they should, good bacteria increase in abundance. One way to tell is by looking at metabolic end-products - volatile fatty acids (VFAs) - excreted by bacteria during digestion of prebiotic fibers.

""Volatile fatty acids are a global indicator for whether prebiotics had an effect on the overall population of bacteria. For example, we might want to see an increase in Lactobacillus and other beneficial bacteria that produce butyrate,"" Dilger explains. Volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations in the colon, blood, and brain were changed in pigs receiving PDX and GOS compared with control pigs.

Recent evidence suggests that bacterial VFAs could be getting into the blood and traveling to the brain, where they could potentially affect mood and behavior.

""We found that, yes, VFAs are absorbed in the blood of pigs that were fed PDX/GOS. And, yes, they do get into the brain,"" Fleming explains. ""But when we looked at the relationship between these VFAs and the results of our behavior tests, there did not appear to be a clear connection.""

Another surprise was a decrease in serotonin in brains of pigs fed the prebiotic. ""When you hear less serotonin, there's an immediate reaction to say, 'Well, that's bad,'"" Fleming says. Not necessarily; those pigs didn't show greater anxiety than control pigs during a stress test or poorer performance when given a learning and memory test. The researchers hypothesize that the prebiotics may alter levels of tryptophan, serotonin's amino acid precursor, but it's too early to say.

Although more work is needed to tackle remaining questions, the study adds to the growing body of research suggesting a strong and potentially modifiable link between the gut and the brain: a link that makers of infant formula should strongly consider.

""There are so many ways we can alter the composition of the microbiota and they can have very strong benefits. Promoting good 'gut health' remains a strong focus in the field of nutrition,"" Dilger says.

"Omega-3s from fish pack a stronger punch than flaxseed and other oils when it comes to cancer prevention, according to a first-ever University of Guelph study.

Prof. David Ma has discovered that marine-based omega-3s are eight times more effective at inhibiting tumour development and growth.

""This study is the first to compare the cancer-fighting potency of plant- versus marine-derived omega-3s on breast tumour development,"" said the professor in the Department of Human Health and Nutritional Sciences. ""There is evidence that both omega-3s from plants and marine sources are protective against cancer and we wanted to determine which form is more effective.""

There are three types of omega-3 fatty acids: a-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). ALA is plant-based and found in such edible seeds as flaxseed and in oils, such as soy, canola and hemp oil. EPA and DHA are found in marine life, such as fish, algae and phytoplankton.

Published in the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry, the study involved feeding the different types of omega-3s to mice with a highly aggressive form of human breast cancer called HER-2. HER-2 affects 25per cent of women and has a poor prognosis.

Ma exposed the mice to either the plant-based or the marine-based omega-3s, beginning in utero.

""The mice were exposed to the different omega-3s even before tumours developed, which allowed us to compare how effective the fatty acids are at prevention,"" said Ma. ""It's known that EPA and DHA can inhibit breast tumour growth, but no one has looked directly at how effective these omega-3s are compared to ALA.""

Ma found overall exposure to marine-based omega-3s reduced the size of the tumours by 60 to 70 per cent and the number of tumours by 30 per cent.

However, higher doses of the plant-based fatty acid were required to deliver the same impact as the marine-based omega-3s.

Omega-3s prevent and fight cancer by turning on genes associated with the immune system and blocking tumour growth pathways, said Ma.

""It seems EPA and DHA are more effective at this. In North America, we don't get enough omega-3s from seafood, so there lies an opportunity to improve our diet and help prevent the risk of breast cancer.""

Based on the doses given in the study, Ma said humans should consume two to three servings of fish a week to have the same effect.

Besides certain foods containing EPA and DHA, supplements and functional foods, such as omega-3 eggs or DHA milk, can offer similar cancer prevention effects, he added.

The next step is to investigate the effects of omega-3s on other forms of breast cancer.

""Seeing the significant benefits omega-3s can have in combatting a highly aggressive form of breast cancer means omega-3s will likely be beneficial for other types of cancer.""

"DALLAS - Jan. 8, 2018 - Exercise can reverse damage to sedentary, aging hearts and help prevent risk of future heart failure - if it's enough exercise, and if it's begun in time, according to a new study by cardiologists at UT Southwestern and Texas Health Resources.

To reap the most benefit, the exercise regimen should begin by late middle age (before age 65), when the heart apparently retains some plasticity and ability to remodel itself, according to the findings by researchers at the Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine (IEEM), which is a collaboration between UT Southwestern Medical Center and Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas.

And the exercise needs to be performed four to five times a week. Two to three times a week was not enough, the researchers found in an earlier study.

""Based on a series of studies performed by our team over the past 5 years, this 'dose' of exercise has become my prescription for life,"" said senior author Dr. Benjamin Levine, Director of the Institute and Professor of Internal Medicine at UT Southwestern. ""I think people should be able to do this as part of their personal hygiene - just like brushing your teeth and taking a shower.""

The regimen included exercising four to five times a week, generally in 30-minute sessions, plus warmup and cool-down:

One of the weekly sessions included a high-intensity 30-minute workout, such as aerobic interval sessions in which heart rate tops 95 percent of peak rate for 4 minutes, with 3 minutes of recovery, repeated four times (a so-called ""4 x 4"").

Each interval session was followed by a recovery session performed at relatively low intensity.

One day's session lasted an hour and was of moderate intensity. (As a ""prescription for life,"" Levine said this longer session could be a fun activity such as tennis, aerobic dancing, walking, or biking.)

One or two other sessions were performed each week at a moderate intensity, meaning the participant would break a sweat, be a little short of breath, but still be able to carry on a conversation -- the ""talk test."" In the study, exercise sessions were individually prescribed based on exercise tests and heart rate monitoring.

One or two weekly strength training sessions using weights or exercise machines were included on a separate day, or after an endurance session.

Study participants built up to those levels, beginning with three, 30-minute, moderate exercise sessions for the first 3 months and peaked at 10 months when two high-intensity aerobic intervals were added.

The more than 50 participants in the study were divided into two groups, one of which received two years of supervised exercise training and the other group, a control group, which participated in yoga and balance training.

At the end of the two-year study, those who had exercised showed an 18 percent improvement in their maximum oxygen intake during exercise and a more than 25 percent improvement in compliance, or elasticity, of the left ventricular muscle of the heart, Dr. Levine noted. He compared the change in the heart to a stretchy, new rubber band versus one that has gotten stiff sitting in a drawer.

Sedentary aging can lead to a stiffening of the muscle in the heart's left ventricle, the chamber that pumps oxygen-rich blood back out to the body, he explained.

""When the muscle stiffens, you get high pressure and the heart chamber doesn't fill as well with blood. In its most severe form, blood can back up into the lungs. That's when heart failure develops,"" said Dr. Levine, who holds the S. Finley Ewing Chair for Wellness at Texas Health Dallas and the Harry S. Moss Heart Chair for Cardiovascular Research. He also holds the Distinguished Professorship in Exercise Sciences at UT Southwestern, which is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year.

Earlier research by UT Southwestern cardiologists showed that left ventricular stiffening often shows up in middle age in people who don't exercise and aren't fit, leaving them with small, stiff chambers that can't pump blood as well.

However, the researchers also found that the heart chamber in competitive masters-level athletes remains large and elastic, and that even four to five days of committed exercise over decades is enough for noncompetitive athletes to reap most of this benefit.

In the current study, researchers wanted to know if exercise can restore the heart's elasticity in previously sedentary individuals - especially if begun in late middle age. Previous studies from Dr. Levine's research program have shown substantial improvements in cardiac compliance in young individuals after a year of training, but surprisingly little change if the training was started after age 65.

To start the study, researchers recruited 53 participants, ages 45 to 64. Many came from the Dallas Heart Study, which includes 6,000 Dallas residents and is the only single-center heart study of its size and multiethnic composition. The Dallas Heart Study is designed to improve the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of heart disease.

Collaborators on the study included first author Dr. Erin Howden, Research Fellow with UT Southwestern's Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and the IEEM and now a faculty member at the Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute in Melbourne, Australia. Funding came from the National Institutes of Health and the American Heart Association.

HealthDay Reporter

TUESDAY, Jan. 30, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Stimulating the brain with an implantable device may be safe -- and possibly helpful -- for some people with Alzheimer's disease, a small pilot study suggests.

In what researchers described as a ""proof of concept"" treatment, three Alzheimer's patients had deep brain stimulation (DBS) wires implanted in the brain -- in areas related to skills like planning, judgment and problem-solving.

Over the next 18 months or more, the tactic appeared to be safe. And there were ""signals"" that it was slowing down two of the patients' decline, said lead researcher Dr. Douglas Scharre, director of cognitive neurology at Ohio State University's Wexner Medical Center.

Deep brain stimulation is already used to treat some cases of Parkinson's disease and certain other brain disorders.

But it's far too early to know whether it has value for people with Alzheimer's, Scharre stressed.

""This is not ready for prime time,"" he said. ""It's not something patients can ask their neurologist for.""

Keith Fargo, who directs scientific programs and outreach for the Alzheimer's Association, agreed.

It's ""much too early"" for patients or caregivers to seek out DBS, said Fargo, who was not involved in the study.

Instead, he said, these findings suggest that deep brain stimulation is ""a reasonable route"" to study in larger clinical trials.

The results were published online Jan. 30 in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease.

Deep brain stimulation involves implanting electrodes in the brain, then connecting them to a pulse generator placed under the skin of the chest. Sometimes called a ""brain pacemaker,"" it delivers electrical pulses that alter the activity in specific brain ""circuits.""

The theory behind trying DBS for Alzheimer's patients, Scharre said, is similar to the ""use it or lose it"" principle: If key brain areas can be stimulated to form new connections among cells, it might slow decline.

Right now, Scharre noted, medications for Alzheimer's target brain chemicals involved in memory.

But Alzheimer's impairs all kinds of mental functions -- including judgment, planning and decision-making. And those issues have a huge impact on daily life, for patients and their caregivers, Scharre added.

So, the patients in his study received DBS, for at least 18 months, to brain areas that regulate those mental skills. All three patients were in the earlier stages of Alzheimer's and were on standard medications.

After starting DBS, all saw a general decline in their memory, problem-solving and other skills. But they declined at a slower rate, compared to 96 similar patients whose information was taken from an Alzheimer's research database.

Two of the DBS patients declined at a ""meaningfully"" slower rate, according to Scharre. That included one who actually showed some improvements.

That patient was LaVonne Moore, 85, of Delaware, Ohio. When she entered the study, she was not preparing any meals. After two years of deep brain stimulation, she'd regained that skill -- and was better able to perform some other simple tasks, like selecting her clothes and organizing outings.

In a Ohio State news release, her husband, Tom Moore, said her Alzheimer's has progressed, but more slowly than he'd expected.

""LaVonne has had Alzheimer's disease longer than anybody I know, and that sounds negative, but it's really a positive thing because it shows that we're doing something right,"" Moore said.

If DBS ever becomes an option for Alzheimer's, Scharre said it would not be for everyone.

It would not be appropriate, for example, for people who are frail or have other serious medical conditions.

In the pilot study, side effects included hot flashes, heart palpitations and burning sensations in the skin, which were reversed by adjusting the DBS settings, the researchers said.

There is no larger trial in the works yet, according to Scharre.

What's needed, said Fargo, is research that compares deep brain stimulation against a placebo device.

On a broader level, he noted, this study highlights an important point: ""Alzheimer's disease is more than just amnesia.""

For caregivers, Fargo said, the problems with abilities like judgment and planning can actually be more challenging. So any new therapies that help address those issues would be welcome.

More than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer's -- a number that could rise to 16 million by 2050, according to the Alzheimer's Association.

Humans have suffered from migraines for millennia. Yet, despite decades of research, there isn't a drug on the market today that prevents them by targeting the underlying cause. All of that could change in a few months when the Food and Drug Administration is expected to announce its decision about new therapies that have the potential to turn migraine treatment on its head.

The new therapies are based on research begun in the 1980s showing that people in the throes of a migraine attack have high levels of a protein called calcitonin gene–related peptide, or CGRP, in their blood.

Step by step, researchers tracked and studied this neurochemical's effects. They found that injecting the peptide into the blood of people prone to migraines triggers migraine-like headaches, whereas people not prone to migraines experienced, at most, mild pain. Blocking transmission of CGRP in mice appeared to prevent migraine-like symptoms. And so a few companies started developing a pill that might do the same in humans.

Clinical trials of the first pills were effective against migraine but halted in 2011 over concerns about potential liver damage. So, four pharmaceutical companies rejiggered their approach. To bypass the liver, all four instead looked to an injectable therapy called monoclonal antibodies — tiny immune molecules most commonly used to treat cancer. Not only do these bypass the liver to block CGRP, but one injection appears to be effective for up to three months with almost no noticeable side effects.

Two manufacturers, Amgen (in collaboration with Novartis) and Teva Pharmaceuticals, have completed clinical trials and expect to hear from the FDA by June whether the therapies have been approved. Two more companies, Eli Lilly and Alder Biopharmaceuticals, plan to file for FDA approval later this year.

Current treatments don't always work

It's been a long time coming. Right now, the only available preventive treatments are accidental discoveries: A number of people prescribed medications for depression, high blood pressure and epilepsy discovered migraine relief, too. Now, many of those drugs, including propranolol and topiramate, have been tested and approved for migraine. But no one drug works for everyone, and side effects can prove intolerable or downright unpleasant.

Migraines are throbbing, one-sided headaches that can be accompanied by nausea as well as sensitivity to light, sound, smell, and movement. At their best, the headaches are an annoyance. At their worst, they can be completely debilitating. So for those of us who get numerous migraines each month, the prospect of a new approach feels almost life-changing.

According to one recent survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 10 percent of men and 20 percent of women in the U.S. reported having had a migraine in the last three months. And up to 2 percent of all Americans has at least 15 migraine days every single month. The toll such pain can take on health, morale, and productivity is substantial.

My own migraines started when I was 13. They struck a few times a week and I thought they were normal headaches. For a while, I tried the usual over the counter pain relievers but, one by one, they stopped working. By age 25, I started to wonder if there was something seriously wrong with my head. My general practitioner diagnosed me with migraines, gave me my first preventive medication — an antidepressant — then sent me to see a specialist.

Since that day more than 17 years ago, I have tried six preventive prescription medications. Not one helped. I alternated among four different, neurologist-recommended supplements, all to no avail. I received bi-monthly injections of magnesium and participated in one of the first clinical trials of Botox. And while Botox seemed to decrease my migraines by one or two per month, it wasn't enough to bother fighting about it with a new insurance company. I exercised regularly. I experimented with an elimination diet that left me eating nothing but broccoli and white rice, but still the migraines came. I averaged about 15 to 20 each month.

Still, I considered myself lucky. The headaches almost never came with nausea, and I had medications that typically ousted them within an hour or two. All told, I usually lost only a few hours of productivity a week.

When I grew older and had two children, my body changed and my migraines changed, too. I get them less frequently now, but when they come, they can stick around for a few days or even a week. Abortive medications still work, except when they don't. So when I heard about a new approach that was making its way through a number of pharmaceutical company pipelines, I began combing through the national clinical trials database to find a trial near me. I found one about 80 miles away, which didn't seem too far a trek considering the tantalizing reward of a migraine-free life. I made an appointment.

Clinical trials seem promising

Neurologist David Dodick, at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, has been involved in multiple clinical trials with each of the four anti-CGRP antibody treatments in development. And, he admits, he's optimistic. He has good reason to be: Each of the therapies decreases migraine frequency by at least one to two days per month. ""In a field where, over time, the progress and pace of research in understanding the underlying biology and mechanism of disease has been slow, this was very exciting,"" he says.

Because migraines are not life-threatening, most drugs have to pass a pretty high bar to be approved. And so far, patients on the experimental treatments report limited side effects that consist mostly of pain at the injection site. Unlike the current preventive medications, there is no nausea, no fuzzy thinking, no nerve pain, no weight loss or gain. And instead of remembering to take a daily pill, there is just a once-monthly injection.

Neurologists already have patients eager to test these therapies, especially when everything else they've tried hasn't worked. ""There's a big hole to fill, both in prevention and acute therapies,"" says Alexander Mauskop, director of the New York Headache Center in New York City. (Disclosure: He's my former neurologist.) ""If I have someone who's really suffering and can't find a solution, I tell them that in June I might have something new for them to try."" Right now, he says, he has a list of about two dozen such patients.

High price tag

Even if the new therapies are approved, however, patients may still have to jump through a number of hoops to get them. Biologic therapies like these are expensive, and treatment could reportedly range anywhere from $8,000 to $18,000 a year. At that price, Mauskop and other neurologists expect insurance companies to require patients to have tried just about everything else first.

The other hitch at this stage is a lack of long-term safety data. ""If someone is well-controlled with Botox or another drug, I'd not suggest they switch,"" Mauskop says. ""With Vioxx, it took 10 years before they discovered that it increased the risk of heart problems.""

Side effects are a potential concern. Elizabeth Loder, chief of headache at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, points out that because CGRP constricts blood vessels, there may be potential long-term effects on blood pressure or other cardiovascular function. In women of childbearing age, who are the ones most prone to frequent migraines, ""you can imagine that might have effects on fertility or placental function.""

Right now, the longest patients have been on one of these new therapies is one to two years.

I ask Mauskop whether he'd recommend I enroll in a clinical trial, given my failure to respond to most everything else. He pauses, noting that he's no longer my neurologist and that he can't really give me any suggestions. But then he says that, since I'd previously shown some response to Botox, perhaps I might want to give it another try. I think about my two young children and my risk tolerance. Perhaps in 10 years I'll feel differently. For now, however, I pick up the phone and cancel my clinical trial appointment.

"A treatment that improves the lives of nearly 1.3 million people with rheumatoid arthritis might one day originate from scorpion venom. A group of researchers led by Dr. Christine Beeton at Baylor College of Medicine has found that one of the hundreds of components in scorpion venom can reduce the severity of the disease in animal models, without inducing side effects associated with similar treatments. The study appears in the Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.

""Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease - one in which the immune system attacks its own body. In this case, it affects the joints,"" said Beeton, associate professor of molecular physiology and biophysics and member Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center at Baylor College of Medicine. ""Cells called fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) play a major role in the disease. As they grow and move from joint to joint, they secrete products that damage the joints and attract immune cells that cause inflammation and pain. As damage progresses, the joints become enlarged and are unable to move.""

Current treatments target the immune cells involved in the disease and none are specific for FLS. Beeton and her colleagues studied FLS looking for an 'Achilles' heel' that would allow them to prevent or stop them from damaging the joints.

""In previous work, we identified a potassium channel on FLS of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and found that the channel was very important for the development of the disease,"" Beeton said. ""We wanted to find a way to block the channel to stop the cells damaging the joints.""

Potassium channels work by opening gates on the surface of cells that allow potassium ions - small charged atoms - to flow in and out of the cell. The flow of ions through the channels is necessary for the cells to carry out many of their essential functions. Animals such as scorpions have venoms that block potassium and other ion channels. They use the venoms to paralyze and kill prey. Decades ago, scientists discovered this and realized that, if handled correctly, venoms also might have medicinal applications.

Scorpion venom may lead to improved treatments for rheumatoid arthritis

""Scorpion venom has hundreds of different components. One of the components in the venom of the scorpion called Buthus tamulus specifically blocks the potassium channel of FLS and not the channels in other cells such as those of the nervous system,"" said first author Dr. Mark Tanner, a graduate student in the Beeton lab during the development of this project. ""Here, we investigated whether this venom component, called iberiotoxin, would be able to specifically block the FLS potassium channel and reduce the severity of the rheumatoid arthritis in rat models of the disease.""

When the researchers treated rat models of the disease with iberiotoxin, they stopped the progression of the disease. In some cases they reversed the signs of established disease, meaning that the animals had better joint mobility and less inflammation in their joints. In addition, treatment with iberiotoxin did not induce side effects, such as tremors and incontinence, observed when treating with another channel blocker called paxilline.

""It was very exciting to see that iberiotoxin is very specific for the potassium channel in FLS and that it did not seem to affect the channels in other types of cells, which might explain the lack of tremors and incontinence,"" Tanner said.

""Although these results are promising, much more research needs to be conducted before we can use scorpion venom components to treat rheumatoid arthritis,"" Beeton said. ""We think that this venom component, iberiotoxin, can become the basis for developing a new treatment for rheumatoid arthritis in the future.""

"NIH scientists adapt new brain disease test for Parkinson’s, dementia with Lewy bodies

NIAID

What

National Institutes of Health scientists developing a rapid, practical test for the early diagnosis of prion diseases have modified the assay to offer the possibility of improving early diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. The group, led by NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), tested 60 cerebral spinal fluid samples, including 12 from people with Parkinson’s disease, 17 from people with dementia with Lewy bodies, and 31 controls, including 16 of whom had Alzheimer’s disease. The test correctly excluded all the 31 controls and diagnosed both Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies with 93 percent accuracy.

Importantly, test results were available within two days, compared to related assays that require up to 13 days. The group conducted the tests using Real-Time Quaking-Induced Conversion (RT-QuIC), an assay developed and refined over the past decade at NIAID’s Rocky Mountain Laboratories. Scientists from the University of California San Diego, University of Verona in Italy, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, and the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, collaborated on the project. The research findings were published in Acta Neuropathologica Communications.

Multiple neurological disorders, including Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, involve the abnormal clumping of a protein called alpha-synuclein into brain deposits called Lewy bodies. The pathological processes in these diseases resembles prion diseases in mammal brains. Like prion diseases, Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies result in progressive deterioration of brain functions and, ultimately, death. Parkinson’s disease is about 1,000 times more common than prion diseases, affecting up to 1 million people in the United States, with 60,000 new cases diagnosed each year. Lewy body dementia affects an estimated 1.4 million people in the United States, according to the Lewy Body Dementia Association.

Early and accurate diagnoses of these brain disorders is essential for developing treatments and identifying patients eligible for clinical trials. The diseases typically progress for years before symptoms appear, and once they do, distinguishing one disease from another can be difficult.

The NIAID group continues to adapt the RT-QuIC assay to detect additional types of neurological diseases with greater accuracy using the least invasive patient sample possible — whether that is blood, skin, nasal brushings, or other samples. The group also has trained many international colleagues to use and advance the test.

MONDAY, Feb. 12, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- As a particularly nasty flu season rages across the United States, scientists have found a powerful new disinfectant that makes ""light"" work of the virus.

Researchers say a certain spectrum of ultraviolet light -- called far-UVC -- easily kills airborne flu viruses while posing no risk to people.

It could offer a new, inexpensive way to eliminate airborne flu viruses in indoor public spaces such as hospitals, doctors' offices, schools, airports and aircraft, said the team from Columbia University Medical Center in New York City.

The disinfecting success of initial experiments still need to be confirmed, said lead research David Brenner.

But he believes ""the use of overhead, low-level far-UVC light in public locations would be a safe and efficient method for limiting the transmission and spread of airborne-mediated microbial diseases, such as influenza and tuberculosis.""

As the researchers explained, broad-spectrum UVC light kills viruses and bacteria, and it is currently used to decontaminate surgical equipment. But this type of light can cause skin cancer and cataracts, so it's not used in public spaces.

However, Brenner and his colleagues wondered if a much narrower spectrum of ultraviolet light, far-UVC, might be a safer option.

In prior studies, they found that far-UVC light killed methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bacteria -- a common and dangerous ""superbug"" -- without harming human or mouse skin.

In this new study, they found that far-UVC light also killed airborne H1N1 virus, a common strain of flu virus.

""Far-UVC light has a very limited range and cannot penetrate through the outer dead-cell layer of human skin or the tear layer in the eye, so it's not a human health hazard,"" said Brenner, who directs Columbia's Center for Radiological Research.

However, ""because viruses and bacteria are much smaller than human cells, far-UVC light can reach their DNA and kill them,"" he said in a university news release.

Lamps with this type of UV light currently cost less than $1,000, Brenner said, but that price would likely fall if the lamps were mass-produced.

""And unlike flu vaccines, far-UVC is likely to be effective against all airborne microbes, even newly emerging strains,"" he said.

Two flu experts were encouraged by the findings.

""The prospect of reducing the transmission of influenza and other respiratory viruses using far-UV radiation is very exciting,"" said Dr. Michael Grosso, chief medical officer at Huntington Hospital in Huntington, N.Y.

""Though hand-washing remains critically important, it does not prevent every instance of transmission,"" Grosso said. ""Immunization and antiviral medications are also important, but again, have limitations. It appears that low-dose far-UV light is safe and effective, and has the advantage of inactivating a wide range of disease-causing viruses.""

Dr. Len Horovitz, a pulmonary specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, agreed.

He noted that the technology's cost ""is not prohibitive, and it is safe. This use can sterilize the air in a public space, reducing the spread of respiratory droplets containing flu viruses and other bacteria and viruses.""

The findings were published online Feb. 9 in the journal Scientific Reports.

"Story highlights The test looks for elevated levels of two proteins after brain injury

There are about 2.8 million concussion-related hospital visits every year

(CNN) The US Food and Drug Administration has, for the first time, approved a blood test to help detect concussion in adults.

The Brain Trauma Indicator test measures two biomarkers: proteins known as UCH-L1 and GFAP that are released upon injury to the brain and pass through the blood-brain barrier. Elevated levels of the proteins can be detected within 15 or 20 minutes of injury. The test can be taken within 12 hours of injury, and results can be obtained within three or four hours.

Patients are currently diagnosed with concussion based on a combination of symptoms as well as imaging. However, CT scans don't always detect concussion.

""Over 90% of CT scans (for concussion) are negative. And you get 200 times the radiation of a chest X-ray. It's expensive; it's not terrific,"" said Hank Nordhoff, chairman and CEO of Banyan Biomarkers, maker of the new test. It can help determine whether a patient further needs a CT scan, based on a physician's concerns.

""Today's action supports the FDA's Initiative to Reduce Unnecessary Radiation Exposure from Medical Imaging -- an effort to ensure that each patient is getting the right imaging exam, at the right time, with the right radiation dose,"" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in a statement Wednesday.

"""Remarkable"" -- that’s how researchers are describing the results of a new study done on mice displaying traits associated with Alzheimer's disease.

The deletion of just a single enzyme saw the near total reversal of the deposition of amyloid plaques found in brains of those with Alzheimer's, improving cognitive functions in the mouse subjects, according to the study from researchers at the Cleveland Clinic, published Feb. 14 in the Journal of Experimental Medicine.

These promising research findings center around deleting a gene that produces an enzyme called BACE1, which helps make the beta-amyloid peptides that accumulate abnormally in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease. Studies have shown that stopping or reducing that enzyme’s activity dramatically reduces production of beta-amyloid peptides, which are toxic to the brain and lead to the symptoms -- including memory loss -- associated with Alzheimer's.

By using BACE1 inhibitors to gradually lower the enzyme's levels, researchers saw reduced neuron loss and better brain function in the mice, offering hope for human subjects down the line, according to the study.

Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research via Journal of Experimental Medicine

However, researchers urge caution with the results as many Alzheimer’s discoveries seem to hold true in mice, then fail in people.

Cleveland Clinic researcher Riqiang Yan, Ph.D., an author on the study, told ABC News that in the mouse model, the gene that produces the enzyme was deleted, completely stopping the enzyme's production. But in humans, it’s unlikely that BACE1 inhibitors would totally halt the enzyme's production, Yan said.

Nonetheless, five BACE1 inhibitors are being tested in human subjects currently, Yan added.

“BACE1 inhibitors are still hopeful for AD patients if they have no unwanted side effects or can be tolerated for long-term use,” Yan said.

Yan added researchers are currently in phase II and, in some cases, phase III clinical trials for the various compounds.

"Blood and urine test, believed to be first of its kind, could lead to earlier diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders

Scientists in Britain say they have developed a blood and urine test that can detect autism in children.

Researchers at the University of Warwick said the test, believed to be the first of its kind, could lead to earlier diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in children who could then be given appropriate treatment much earlier in their lives.

ASDs mainly affect a person’s social interaction and communication, with symptoms that can include speech disturbances, repetitive and/or compulsive behaviour, hyperactivity, anxiety, and difficulty adapting to new environments.

As there is a wide range of ASD symptoms, diagnosis can be difficult and uncertain, particularly at the early stages of development. It is estimated that about one in every 100 people in the UK has ASD, with more boys diagnosed with the condition than girls.

Scientists said their research found a link between ASD and damage to proteins in blood plasma. They found the most reliable of the tests they developed was examining protein in blood plasma, which found children with ASD had higher levels of the oxidation marker dityrosine (DT) and certain sugar-modified compounds called advanced glycation end-products (AGEs).

Genetic causes are thought to be responsible for about a third of cases of ASD, while the rest are believed to be caused by a combination of environmental factors, mutations, and rare genetic variants. However, researchers believe their new tests could reveal yet-to-be-identified causes of ASD.

They also confirmed the previously held belief that mutations of amino acid transporters are a genetic variant associated with ASD.

The Warwick team worked with collaborators at the University of Bologna in Italy, who recruited 38 children who had been diagnosed with ASD along with a control group of 31 other children between the ages of five and 12. Blood and urine samples were taken from the children for analysis.

The Warwick team discovered there were chemical differences between the two groups. Working with a further collaborator at the University of Birmingham, the changes in multiple compounds were combined using artificial intelligence algorithm techniques to develop a mathematical equation to distinguish between ASD and healthy controls. The outcome was a diagnostic test better than any existing method.

They said the next steps were to repeat the study with further groups of children to confirm the good diagnostic performance and to assess if the test could identify ASD at very early stages, indicate how the ASD is likely to develop further to more severe disease, and assess if treatments were working.

The research was led by Naila Rabbani, reader of experimental systems biology at the University of Warwick, who said: “Our discovery could lead to earlier diagnosis and intervention. We hope the tests will also reveal new causative factors.

“With further testing we may reveal specific plasma and urinary profiles – or ‘fingerprints’ – of compounds with damaging modifications. This may help us improve the diagnosis of ASD and point the way to new causes of ASD.”

The research has been published in the journal Molecular Autism.

• Note added 27 February 2018: The UK autism research charity, Autistica, provided the following comment to the Guardian: “This is a small, early-stage study which may explain one biological difference in autism. At this stage, the results presented are not strong enough to suggest that this method could be used for the diagnosis of autism. For example, we don’t know whether this technique can distinguish autism from ADHD, anxiety or other similar conditions. There have been many previous attempts to develop a biological test for autism. Still, the best way to diagnose autism is through clinical interview and observation, which takes into account the many features of autism.”"	New test can detect autism in children, scientists say	2018-02-19 06:00:00	https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/19/autism-children-blood-urine-test	story_reviews_00106	fake
"Scientists working for Google’s parent company Alphabet have used artificial intelligence to determine a person’s risk of having a heart attack from their retinal scan.

The method—detailed in a paper published on Monday, February 19, in the Nature journal Biomedical Engineering— involves analyzing blood vessels in an area of the eye called the retinal fundus.

The researchers from Verily, formerly known as Google Life Sciences, developed the algorithm in the hope of making accurate assessments of patients’ cardiovascular health more quickly and easily than current methods.

Training deep-learning models on data from more than a quarter of a million patients, the scientists were able to predict the cardiovascular risk factors that were not previously thought to be present in retinal fundus images.

The risk factors include the person’s gender, smoking status, blood pressure and age—estimated to within four years of the patient’s actual age.

“Most cardiovascular risk calculators use some combination of these parameters to identify patients at risk of experiencing either a major cardiovascular event or cardiac-related mortality within a pre-specified time period, such as 10 years,” the paper states.

“However, some of these parameters may be unavailable… We therefore explored whether additional signals for cardiovascular risk can be extracted from retinal images, which can be obtained quickly, cheaply and non-invasively in an outpatient setting.”

Deep learning networks have already been applied to produce algorithms capable of diagnosing diseases like melanoma and blindness caused by diabetes.

Further tests are required before this latest method can be used within a clinical setting.

The researchers concluded: “The opportunity to one day readily understand the health of a patient’s blood vessels, key to cardiovascular health, with a simple retinal image could lower the barrier to engage in critical conversations on preventive measures to protect against a cardiovascular event.”"	Google Retinal Scans Can Predict if You Will Have a Heart Attack	2018-02-20 12:21:58	https://web.archive.org/web/20180220114848/http://www.newsweek.com/google-retinal-scans-predict-heart-attack-812098	story_reviews_00104	fake

More than 300 million people worldwide have depression, according to the World Health Organization, of which less than half recieve effective treatments. In many countries, the rate drops to less than 10 percent.

In the U.S., the National Institute of Mental Health estimates 16.2 million adults experienced at least one major depressive episode in 2016. Approximately 37 percent of these people received no treatment.

In the U.K, where a number of the study authors are based, at least one million more people could benefit from drugs or psychotherapy, senior author John Geddes said.

Some drugs more effective than others

The researchers analyzed existing studies of 21 different drugs, and found some were much more effective than others.

Drugs ranged from more than one third more effective than a placebo to more than twice as effective. The best performers included amitriptyline and escitalopram, while the worst included fluoxetine—commonly sold under the trade name Prozac—and reboxetine, which is not approved for sale in the U.S.

A complex treatment picture

The results add up to a complex treatment picture for what authors called “one of the most common, burdensome, and costly psychiatric disorders worldwide in adults.”

Antidepressants do not improve symptoms in about 40 percent of people, study author Andrea Cipriani of Oxford University told a press briefing.

While these results should reassure many people with depression that antidepressants can be effective, “this does not necessarily mean antidepressants should always be the first line of treatment,” he said.

Talking therapies are thought to be about as effective as antidepressant medication, but these are often much more expensive.

Experts not involved in the research agreed the results were significant.

Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the U.K.’s Royal College of GPs, expressed concern about the stigma surrounding antidepressant use.

She said in a statement: “Taking antidepressants is frequently portrayed as a negative thing or something done only when other therapies are not available or have failed, but this in itself can add to the unfortunate stigma that sometimes exists around people with mental health conditions.”

But she also urged caution. “Although antidepressants are of proven benefit—as this study shows,” she said, “no doctor wants their patients to become reliant on medication.”

Putting a long-held controversy to bed

Carmine Pariante, a professor at the UK’s Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience and spokesperson for the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said the study ""finally puts to bed the controversy on antidepressants.""

"(Reuters Health) - People who get minimally-invasive surgery to replace damaged heart valves have an easier time completing daily tasks and a better quality of life after the procedure, a research review suggests.

The analysis focused on people with what’s known as aortic stenosis, which occurs when the large blood vessels leading away from the heart narrow, forcing it to work much harder to pump blood. The condition tends to develop with age and can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue and heart failure.

Patients in the study had minimally-invasive surgery that fixes the problem by inserting a replacement valve to send blood around the damaged valve while leaving it in place. This procedure, known as a transcatheter aortic valve replacement, is done by threading a catheter to the heart through a small incision in the chest or from the large artery in the groin - it doesn’t require cutting open the chest.

Afterward, patients could walk significantly further in six-minute walking tests used to assess their functional capacity. On average, they added almost 42 meters (138 feet) to their performance before surgery.

In addition, patients reported clinically meaningful improvements in their quality of life and their ability to complete daily tasks after surgery.

The results offer fresh evidence that transcatheter aortic valve replacement can help ease symptoms like shortness of breath and fatigue that limit the ability to handle physical exertion, said Dr. David Cohen, director of cardiovascular research at Saint Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas City, Missouri.

“These symptoms lead to reduced functional capacity (inability to perform physical exertion) and also impact a patient’s overall sense of wellbeing and quality of life,” Cohen, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.

“By replacing the diseased aortic valve, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (and surgical valve replacement) reverses these effects and generally allows the patient to return to his or her ‘normal’ quality of life - limited only by the impact of other conditions that the patient may have,” Cohen said by email.

Overall, the current analysis included 2,775 patients from a total of 20 previously published studies on outcomes for this type of surgery.

Participants were 82 years old, on average, and they were typically considered high-risk surgical patients due to either advanced age or other medical issues.

The smaller studies in the analysis ranged in size from 36 to 484 patients, and most of them followed patients for as long as six to 12 months after surgery.

One limitation of the current analysis is that many of these smaller studies were not controlled experiments designed to prove whether or how transcatheter aortic valve replacement might improve quality of life, lead study author Nicola Straiton of the University of Sydney and colleagues note in Age and Ageing. Straiton didn’t respond to emails seeking comment.

People who don’t get this type of minimally invasive surgery may instead get a more invasive procedure that involves surgeons cutting open the chest to repair a damaged valve.

Surgeons may also perform what’s known as angioplasty, which uses a catheter to insert a tiny balloon and inflate it to open the valve; sometimes surgeons will also insert a stent, or tiny wire mesh cage, to keep the artery propped open.

Results of the current study reaffirm that a minimally-invasive procedure can be a viable option, even for elderly people who are high-risk surgical patients, said Dr. Samir Kapadia, a cardiovascular medicine researcher at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.

“Replacing the aortic valve improves functional capacity,” Kapadia, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is an important minimally invasive treatment option for replacing the aortic valve that is narrowed.”

"Chemotherapy is administered to a cancer patient via intravenous drip in Durham, N.C. IVs are one of the most common things in health care.

New research calls into question what’s in those IV bags that nearly every hospitalized patient gets. Using a different intravenous fluid instead of the usual saline greatly reduced the risk of death or kidney damage, two large studies found.

The difference could mean 50,000 to 70,000 fewer deaths and 100,000 fewer cases of kidney failure each year in the U.S., researchers estimate. Some doctors are hoping the results will persuade more hospitals to switch.

“We’ve been sounding the alarm for 20 years” about possible harms from saline, said Dr. John Kellum, a critical care specialist at the University of Pittsburgh. “It’s purely inertia” that prevents a change, he said.

Kellum had no role in the two studies, which were discussed Tuesday at a critical care conference in San Antonio and published by the New England Journal of Medicine. Federal grants helped pay for the work.

IVs are one of the most common things in health care. They are used to prevent dehydration, maintain blood pressure, or give patients medicines or nutrients if they can’t eat.

Saline — salt dissolved in water — has been the most widely used fluid in the U.S. for more than a century even as evidence has emerged that it can harm kidneys, especially when used a lot.

Other IV solutions called balanced fluids include saline but also contain potassium and other things that make them more like plasma, the clear part of blood. They’re widely used in Europe and Australia.

The studies involved 28,000 patients at Vanderbilt University who were given IVs of saline or a balanced fluid. For every 100 people on balanced fluids, there was one fewer death or severe kidney problem.

Since there are about 30 million people hospitalized in the U.S. alone each year, “there are tens or hundreds of thousands of patients who would be spared death or severe kidney problems by using balanced fluids instead of saline,” said one study leader, Vanderbilt’s Dr. Matthew Semler.

After seeing the results two months ago, Vanderbilt hospital officials decided to primarily use balanced fluids. The University of Pittsburgh also has largely switched to them, Kellum said.

The fluids cost about the same — a dollar or two per IV — and many suppliers make both types, so switching should not be hard or expensive, doctors said.

IV fluids have been in the news since Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico last fall, shutting down electricity to three plants owned by Baxter International (BAX), one of the biggest makers of these fluids. The shortage has eased, but some supply issues remain.

"Queensland University of Technology (QUT) researchers have identified a drug that could potentially help our brains reboot and reverse the damaging impacts of heavy alcohol consumption on regeneration of brain cells.

Their studies in adult mice show that two weeks of daily treatment with the drug tandospirone reversed the effects of 15 weeks of binge-like alcohol consumption on neurogenesis - the ability of the brain to grow and replace neurons (brain cells). The findings have been published in Scientific Reports.

This is the first time tandospirone has be shown to reverse the deficit in brain neurogenesis induced by heavy alcohol consumption

Tandospirone acts selectively on a serotonin receptor (5-HT1A)

The researchers also showed in mice that the drug was effective in stopping anxiety-like behaviours associated with alcohol withdrawal, and this was accompanied by a significant decrease in binge-like alcohol intake

""This is a novel discovery that tandospirone can reverse the deficit in neurogenesis caused by alcohol,"" said study leader neuroscientist Professor Selena Bartlett from QUT's Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation.

""We know that with heavy drinking you are inhibiting your ability to grow new neurons, brain cells. Alcohol is specifically very damaging for neurons.

""Other studies in mice have shown that tandospirone improves brain neurogenesis, but this is the first time it has been shown that it can totally reverse the neurogenic deficits induced by alcohol.

""This opens the way to look at if neurogenesis is associated with other substance-abuse deficits, such as in memory and learning, and whether this compound can reverse these.""

Professor Bartlett, who is based at the Translational Research Institute, said the discovery by study co-authors QUT postdoctoral research fellows Dr Arnauld Belmer and Dr Omkar Patkar came about serendipitously after research started in a different direction.

""It was surprising, and exciting,"" Dr Belmer said.

""This drug is relatively new and available only in China and Japan. It is commonly used there and shown to be highly effective in treating general anxiety and well tolerated with limited adverse effects.""

Professor Bartlett said researchers are constantly looking at new treatment strategies for alcohol abuse and addiction, which is characterised by extended periods of heavy alcohol use, binges and abstinence, and anxiety and depression which contribute to relapse.

""This is not just another drug that shows promise in helping to reduce binge drinking,"" she said.

""While it could possibly have that effect, it might be able to help reboot the brain and reverse the deficits the alcohol abuse causes - both the inhibition to the brain's ability to regenerate, and the behavioural consequences that come from what alcohol is doing to the brain, like increases in anxiety and depression.""

"DALLAS, Feb. 26, 2018 -- A lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet, which includes eggs and dairy but excludes meat and fish, and a Mediterranean diet are likely equally effective in reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke, according to new research in the American Heart Association's journal Circulation.

Previous separate studies have shown that a Mediterranean diet reduces certain risk factors for cardiovascular disease, as does a vegetarian diet; however, this was the first study to compare effects of the two distinct eating patterns

Current study authors said they wanted to evaluate whether switching to a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet would also be heart-healthy in people who were used to eating both meat and fish. ""To best evaluate this issue, we decided to compare a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet with a Mediterranean diet in the same group of people,"" said Francesco Sofi, M.D., Ph.D, lead study author and professor of clinical nutrition at the University of Florence and Careggi University Hospital in Italy.

The study included 107 healthy but overweight participants, ages 18-75, who were randomly assigned to follow for three months either a low-calorie vegetarian diet, which included dairy and eggs, or a low-calorie Mediterranean diet for three months. The Mediterranean diet included poultry, fish and some red meat as well as fruits, vegetables, beans and whole grains. After three months, the participants switched diets. Most participants were able to stay on both diets.

Researchers found participants on either diet:

lost about 3 pounds of body fat;

lost about 4 pounds of weight overall; and

experienced about the same change in body mass index, a measure of weight in relationship to height.

Authors said they did find two differences between the diets that may be noteworthy. The vegetarian diet was more effective at reducing LDL (the ""bad"") cholesterol, while the Mediterranean diet resulted greater reductions in triglycerides, high levels of which increase the risk for heart attack and stroke.

Still, ""the take-home message of our study is that a low-calorie lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet can help patients reduce cardiovascular risk about the same as a low-calorie Mediterranean diet,"" Sofi said. ""People have more than one choice for a heart-healthy diet.""

In an editorial accompanying the study, Cheryl A. M. Anderson, Ph.D., M.P.H., M.S., an associate professor of preventive medicine at the University of California, San Diego, in California, wrote that there were similarities between the two diets that may explain the results. Both follow ""a healthy dietary pattern rich in fruits and vegetables, legumes [beans], whole grains and nuts; focusing on diet variety, nutrient density and appropriate amount of food; and limiting energy intake from saturated fats.""

Anderson, who was not involved in the study, added that promoting both diets by healthcare professionals ""offer a possible solution to the ongoing challenges to prevent and manage obesity and cardiovascular diseases.""

Study limitations include the fact that participants were at ""relatively low"" risk of cardiovascular disease. Anderson said future research should compare the diets in patients at higher risk for heart disease and should also explore ""whether or not healthful versions of traditional diets around the world that emphasize fresh foods and limit sugars, saturated fats, and sodium can prevent and manage obesity and cardiovascular diseases.""

"Medical Cannabis Significantly Safer for Elderly With Chronic Pain Than Opioids, According to Ben-Gurion University of the Negev Researchers

BEER-SHEVA, Israel...February 13 - Medical cannabis therapy can significantly reduce chronic pain in patients age 65 and older without adverse effects, according to researchers at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU) and the Cannabis Clinical Research Institute at Soroka University Medical Center.

The new study, published in The European Journal of Internal Medicine, found cannabis therapy is safe and efficacious for elderly patients who are seeking to address cancer symptoms, Parkinson's disease, post-traumatic stress disorder, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, and other medical issues.

""While older patients represent a large and growing population of medical cannabis users, few studies have addressed how it affects this particular group, which also suffers from dementia, frequent falls, mobility problems, and hearing and visual impairments,"" says Prof. Victor Novack, M.D., a professor of medicine in the BGU Faculty of Health Sciences (FOHS), and head of the Soroka Cannabis Clinical Research Institute. Novack is also the BGU Gussie Krupp Chair in Internal Medicine.

""After monitoring patients 65 and older for six months, we found medical cannabis treatment significantly relieves pain and improves quality of life for seniors with minimal side effects reported.""

This older population represents a growing segment of medical cannabis users, ranging from approximately seven percent to more than 33 percent, depending on the country. Recent U.S. polls indicate Americans over 65 represent 14 percent of the total population and use more than 30 percent of all prescription drugs, including highly addictive painkillers.

BGU researchers surveyed 2,736 patients 65 years and older who received medical cannabis through ""Tikun Olam,"" the largest Israeli medical cannabis supplier. More than 60 percent were prescribed medical cannabis due to the pain, particularly pain associated with cancer. After six months of treatment, more than 93 percent of 901 respondents reported their pain dropped from a median of eight to four on a 10-point scale. Close to 60 percent of patients who originally reported ""bad"" or ""very bad"" quality of life upgraded to ""good"" or ""very good"" after six months. More than 70 percent of patients surveyed reported moderate to significant improvement in their condition.

The most commonly reported adverse effects were dizziness (9.7 percent) and dry mouth (7.1 percent). After six months, more than 18 percent of patients surveyed had stopped using opioid analgesics or had reduced their dosage.

All patients received a prescription after consulting with a doctor who prescribed treatment. More than 33 percent of patients used cannabis-infused oil; approximately 24 percent inhaled therapy by smoking, and approximately six percent used vaporization.

While the researchers state their findings to date indicate cannabis may decrease dependence on prescription medicines, including opioids, more evidence-based data from this special, aging population is imperative.

"OAK BROOK, Ill. - An MRI breast imaging technique that requires no contrast agent, combined with sophisticated data analysis, could reduce the number of unnecessary breast biopsies, according to a new study appearing online in the journal Radiology.

Breast MRI currently is used to screen women at high risk of breast cancer and as a diagnostic adjunct to mammography. The examination relies on gadolinium-based contrast agents that need to be injected intravenously.

Researchers recently studied an alternative approach that eliminates the need for contrast agents in some cases by using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) measurements derived from MRI. The technique, known as diffusion kurtosis imaging, provides a picture of breast tissue on a microstructural level.

""Diffusion kurtosis imaging has been introduced in DWI to provide important information on tissue structures at a microscopic level,"" said study lead author Sebastian Bickelhaupt, M.D., from the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg, Germany. ""Since malignant lesions disrupt the tissue structures at this level, diffusion kurtosis might serve as a relevant marker of changes.""

Dr. Bickelhaupt, co-lead author Paul Jaeger, M.Sc., and colleagues evaluated a retrospective analysis of data collected from 222 women at two independent study sites. The women had suspicious findings on mammography that were classified under the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) as BI-RADS 4 and 5 breast lesions. A BI-RADS 4 lesion is considered a suspicious abnormality, while a 5 is considered highly suspicious of malignancy. The women underwent DWI followed by biopsy.

For the analysis, a software algorithm was developed for lesion characterization, and imaging features were extracted using a kurtosis-based radiomics model. Radiomics is a rapidly growing field that enables the extraction of a large amount of quantifiable data from images.

In an independent test set of 127 women, the radiomics analysis reduced false-positive findings by 70 percent, while detecting 60 of 61 malignant lesions, or 98 percent.

""The model might help to lower the number of BI-RADS 4 lesions suspected of being cancer on the basis of screening mammography while retaining a high sensitivity similar to the sensitivity reported for biopsies themselves,"" Jaeger said.

Should the results hold in larger trials, the model has potential advantages in the clinic beyond its ability to reduce unnecessary biopsies in women with BI-RADS 4 lesions. The software algorithm makes the assessment reader-independent, ensuring that its accuracy is maintained across different imaging facilities.

The new approach is not intended to replace current contrast-enhanced breast MRI protocols in general, Dr. Bickelhaupt emphasized, but to expand the spectrum of options available for answering specific clinical questions.

""This might also improve the efficiency of reporting,"" he said.

"MINNEAPOLIS - People who eat vegetables, fruit and whole grains may have lower rates of depression over time, according to a preliminary study released today that will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology's 70th Annual Meeting in Los Angeles, April 21 to 27, 2018.

The study found that people whose diets adhered more closely to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet were less likely to develop depression than people who did not closely follow the diet. In addition to fruit and vegetables, the DASH diet recommends fat-free or low-fat dairy products and limits foods that are high in saturated fats and sugar. Studies have shown health benefits such as lowering high blood pressure and bad cholesterol (LDL), along with lowering body weight.

""Depression is common in older adults and more frequent in people with memory problems, vascular risk factors such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol, or people who have had a stroke,"" said study author Laurel Cherian, MD, of Rush University Medical Center in Chicago and a member of the American Academy of Neurology. ""Making a lifestyle change such as changing your diet is often preferred over taking medications, so we wanted to see if diet could be an effective way to reduce the risk of depression.""

For the study, 964 participants with an average age of 81 were evaluated yearly for an average of six-and-a-half years. They were monitored for symptoms of depression such as being bothered by things that usually didn't affect them and feeling hopeless about the future. They also filled out questionnaires about how often they ate various foods, and the researchers looked at how closely the participants' diets followed diets such as the DASH diet, Mediterranean diet and the traditional Western diet.

Participants were divided into three groups based on how closely they adhered to the diets. People in the two groups that followed the DASH diet most closely were less likely to develop depression than people in the group that did not follow the diet closely. The odds of becoming depressed over time was 11 percent lower among the top group of DASH adherers versus the lowest group. On the other hand, the more closely people followed a Western diet--a diet that is high in saturated fats and red meats and low in fruits and vegetables--the more likely they were to develop depression.

Cherian noted that the study does not prove that the DASH diet leads to a reduced risk of depression; it only shows an association.

""Future studies are now needed to confirm these results and to determine the best nutritional components of the DASH diet to prevent depression later in life and to best help people keep their brains healthy,"" said Cherian.

"A commonly-prescribed multiple sclerosis (MS) infusion medication linked to a rare but serious side effect is safer to use when dosing intervals are extended, according to a new study led by MS specialists NYU Langone Health.

The new research showed that extending dosing of natalizumab from every 4 weeks to every 5 to 12 weeks significantly reduced the risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare but potentially fatal brain infection. The authors presented their findings February 2 at the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) Forum 2018 in San Diego.

The findings could influence how neurologists prescribe the medication. ""Neurologists have been looking for safer ways to administer natalizumab infusions to their patients, but there hasn't been clear data on whether decreasing dosing frequency improves safety,"" says first study author Lana Zhovtis Ryerson, MD, assistant professor of neurology at NYU School of Medicine and an attending neurologist at NYU Langone's Multiple Sclerosis Comprehensive Care Center. ""Our safety findings are clinically and statistically significant, and we believe that extending the dosing schedule of natalizumab is practice changing and may save lives.""

Natalizumab, a monoclonal antibody, is used to prevent MS relapses, improve quality of life, and slow worsening disability. The medication is indicated to be prescribed in 300-milligram infusion doses every 4 weeks.

Taking the medication longer than two years, however, may increase risk PML, which is caused by the John Cunningham virus (JCV). There have been 756 PML cases reported worldwide as of January 2018, with a global incidence rate of 4.19 per 1,000 PML cases in people treated with natalizumab. Patients who test JCV antibody-positive are typically either told to not to start natalizumab, or have had treatment stopped after two years, when risk was deemed to be too high.

The new study, however, reports safety data through up to 72 months, or 6 years, when the extended dosing regimens were applied, with risk reduction for PML as high as 94 percent.

How the Study Was Conducted

Researchers reviewed data on all patients who have been exposed to JCV who are enrolled in TOUCH, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-mandated Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program for natalizumab that requires manufacturers to document all uses of a medication to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks. Since the optimal extended dose schedule is not known, researchers chose to look at the data in multiple ways, with the primary definition looking at extended dose history in the last 18 months, the secondary definition looking at extended dose occurring at any time in the dosing history, and for tertiary definition looking primarily at how extended dose history affects PML risk. The results showed clinically and statistically significant risk reductions with all definitions.

The new study did not look at drug efficacy comparing extended to standard doses. However, previous research led by Dr. Zhovtis-Ryerson's group found extending the dose up to 8 weeks did not negatively affect the medication's efficacy in a retrospective sample of 2,000 people. The authors are planning prospective efficacy studies of extended dose natalizumab.

Natalizumab is manufactured by Biogen Idec and Elan, and sold under the name Tysabri®. Biogen provided the researchers access to their data and statistical support.

Other infusion disease-modifying therapies approved to treat MS include the drugs alemtuzumab and ocrelizumab. Oral and injectable medications are also prescribed.

People who are diagnosed with prediabetes can delay or prevent the disease if they change their lifestyle and lose a significant amount of weight. But here's the challenge: How can people be motivated to eat healthier and move more? Increasingly, the answer might include digital medicine.

""Just telling people to do things doesn't work,"" says Sean Duffy, CEO of Omada Health. If it were easy, there wouldn't be more than 80 million adults in the U.S. with prediabetes.

Omada has rolled out a digital program, delivered on smartphones and other devices, that incorporates all the ingredients known to help people overhaul their habits. It includes e-coaching; peer support; education; diet and exercise tracking; and electronic nudging. (Forget to weigh in or track your meals? You'll get texts or emails reminding you to do it.)

""Week by week we have lessons on different themes, "" Duffy explains. ""They're interactive, and there's little games"" to keep it dynamic. Participants are matched with a group of peers (online) and they're led by a coach, who they can text or email back and forth with. ""We call it the symphony effect,"" Duffy says, because there are multiple methods working together to help participants stay on track.

Getting started

Sometimes fear is a good motivator for losing weight. Don Speranza is in his late 60s and lives on a farm along the Columbia River in Washington state, where he runs a bed and breakfast with his wife. He's also the chef at the inn. ""I'm immersed in food all day,"" Speranza says.

Last year he received an email from his doctor at Kaiser Permanente with some test results. ""It was like a gut punch, "" Speranza says.

Based on his weight, which had been crept up to 210 pounds, and the results of his bloodwork to test his glucose, he was diagnosed with prediabetes. This means his blood sugar level was elevated, but not yet high enough to be diagnosed with the condition.

""It was a real come-to-Jesus moment,"" Speranza recalls. He knew that diabetes increased the risk of heart disease and can lead to many other complications including vision loss and amputations.

When he signed up for the Omada program, the first thing he received was a scale. He began to weigh himself daily. He also began to track what he was eating. Each day he'd log his weight and meals and upload the data to a dashboard. His coach could see the data, too, and give him advice and encouragement.

""Oh, my coach, "" Speranza says. ""I can't sing her praises enough, she was so responsive."" Even though they never met in person, they bonded. He took her advice and suggestions.

He realized, for instance, that he ate too much of the wrong things. ""Homemade breads and croissants, pasta and pizza,"" Speranza ticks off the list of baked treats with a mix of reverence and resolve in his voice.

Speranza realized he had to change his relationship with these foods. Temporarily, he cut out all these refined carbohydrates. He had to train himself to resist all the treats he bakes for his guests.

Instead, he began to fill his plate with more protein, vegetables and healthy fats. He raises animals on his organic farm, so he eats pastured meats, and a lot of salmon.

""Week by week, I'd make one or two little changes at a time, "" Speranza says. ""It was a game changer.""

The weight began to fall off, and he started to move more. His coach nudged him to switch up his morning routine. He says he was accustomed to sitting each morning for an hour or so just drinking coffee. ""Now, I'll start the coffee,"" he says, but before he drinks it, ""I'll go outside and walk."" He tracks his movement withe a wearable electronic device. He began with 2,000 steps logged during his morning walk but has now increased his steps significantly. And he rides a stationary bike, too.

""Now, I can almost keep up with my wife,"" Speranza says with a laugh.

Since last May, he has lost about 50 pounds (52, to be exact, but it fluctuates a bit) and his blood sugar has returned to the normal range. He no longer has prediabetes.

""I feel so much better,"" Speranza says. As a baker, he buys flour in 50 pound sacks. ""Now, when I look at [the sacks] I'm aghast to think that's what I was carrying around.""

Success is not automatic

Not every Omada Health participant makes the progress they're aiming for. After all, pulling off these changes is difficult

""I'm still on the journey to get to more optimal, health"" says Lonny Northrup, who lives in Utah. He lost weight while participating in the program, but when he hit a plateau in his weight loss, he felt stuck and he says he didn't get the personal support he would have liked from the program. ""For [many] days in a row I got an email saying, 'Hey, we noticed you didn't step on the scale,' "" he says. ""For some reason that didn't get escalated to the coach."" So he says that was a disappointment.

Overall, he says he would recommend the Omada Health program to a friend. ""I got really good, specific recommendations that worked for me and my lifestyle,"" Northrup says. And he says the convenience of having the program delivered on a smartphone was key, too.

There is some evidence that these kinds of programs are working. A recent pilot study with Utah-based Intermountain Healthcare that included about 200 people, all of whom were at high risk of Type 2 diabetes, found that 75 percent of the participants completed the Omada program and lost at least 5 percent of their body weight. And about 1 in 4 participants lost 7 percent of their body weight or more. That's promising, because there's evidence that a 7 percent body weight loss cuts the risk of developing diabetes by about 60 percent.

""This is one of the most exciting things,"" says Mark Greenwood, a physician with Intermountain.

Omada Health is not the only player in this space. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recognizes many diabetes prevention lifestyle change programs, delivered both in-person and online, including Vida, which bills itself as a ""health transformation team"" that is data and tech-driven.

Additionally, traditional players in the weight loss space, such as Weight Watchers, now offer some similar incentives, such as personal coaching.

Greenwood says he'd like to see many more patients try diabetes prevention programs. And he says he's pleased with the results of the pilot study of Omada's program.

""The data really does confirm that when you give people tools and help, instead of just preaching to them, it really does help."""

"For the past several decades, Alcoholics Anonymous and the 12 steps have dominated addiction treatment in America — boasting millions of adherents and turning into the standard option within most addiction treatment programs in the US.

A new study has found, however, that AA, the original 12-step program, and others like it don’t have to be the only answer for people seeking out mutual help groups to deal with alcohol addiction.

The study, in short, looked at how people’s self-reported outcomes with AA and 12-step programs compare with the three biggest alternative mutual help groups — Women for Sobriety, SMART Recovery, and LifeRing. It concluded that these other groups perform about as well as 12-step programs.

“This study suggests that these alternatives really are viable options for people who are looking for recovery support and don’t like AA for whatever reason,” Sarah Zemore, lead author of the study, told me.

The research is by no means the last word on this question — Zemore characterized the study as the beginning of a deeper evaluation into AA alternatives.

But this is important. There has been a good amount of research into AA and the 12 steps over the years, broadly finding that about a third of people maintain recovery from alcohol addiction due to 12-step treatment, another third get something out of the treatment but not enough for full recovery, and another third get nothing at all.

Researchers have long suspected, though, that the benefits found in 12-step treatment programs are not exclusive to the 12 steps. As Zemore told me, “The benefits of 12-step groups are not driven by the 12 steps’ specific philosophy or adherence to the 12 steps. It’s really more about general mechanisms like abstinence motivation and social support for abstinence. Presumably, you could get those by participating in alternatives to AA.”

In other words, these alternatives could help the one-third to two-thirds of people who don’t get anything or much out of AA. That would help deal with a big public health issue: Based on federal data, more than 20 million people in the US have a substance use disorder, and within that group, more than 15 million have an alcohol use disorder. Excessive drinking alone is linked to 88,000 deaths each year. So finding the right solutions for this problem is literally a matter of life or death.

What the study found

The study, conducted by the Alcohol Research Group at the Public Health Institute in California and published last month in the Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment, surveyed more than 600 people with alcohol use disorder (AUD), who were divided by which mutual help group they primarily participated in. Researchers followed up at six months then 12 months, measuring involvement in the groups and various substance use outcomes, including abstinence from drinking and alcohol-related problems.

After controlling for several factors, the researchers concluded that “[Women for Sobriety], LifeRing, and SMART are as effective as 12-step groups for those with AUDs.”

“Essentially, that’s the story,” Zemore said. “We were really interested in whether the effects of involvement on recovery outcomes depended on which group [participants] were in. And we found that they did not.”

There were some differences in the data. People who reported SMART as their primary group seemed to have worse substance use outcomes, and there were lower odds of total abstinence among LifeRing members.

That might have something to do with differences in recovery goals. For example, AA really emphasizes total abstinence from drinking as the solution to alcohol addiction. Groups like SMART and LifeRing, meanwhile, can be friendlier to the idea of members moderating their drinking but not quitting altogether. That could affect substance use outcomes — and especially abstinence outcomes.

The study’s survey data suggests this is in fact what was going on: When researchers controlled for people’s recovery goals — meaning, whether they wanted to commit to lifetime total abstinence or not — the differences between the 12-step groups, SMART, and LifeRing went away.

“That suggests that people with less commitment to lifetime total abstinence are more likely to participate in SMART and LifeRing than they are to participate in 12-step groups,” Zemore said. “That’s why you’re seeing these associations between SMART and LifeRing affiliation at baseline and worse recovery outcomes when you control for involvement.” She added, “But I want to emphasize that these go away when you control for recovery goals.”

Again, the study is not the final word. John Kelly, an addiction researcher at Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the study, told me that the study is “good news, in general,” but pointed out that it’s limited by its methodology: It’s based on an online survey, not the kind of randomized trial that’s typically the gold standard in research. That may have led to some potentially biased results — perhaps participants in specific groups were less likely to report bad outcomes, for instance.

And since it’s only one study, it’s possible that the results were biased in some other way. So it’s up to future research to verify the findings.

One tricky thing with this line of research is you can’t really force people to participate in certain groups — so studies that randomly assign participants to AA, SMART, LifeRing, or Women for Sobriety may not be easy to do. But there are ways that researchers could get around these problems, such as only using participants who are willing to try different groups and actively following up with them to make sure they are actually participating.

Another big research question: figuring out why, exactly, these groups might work to help people stay alcohol- or drug-free. There’s good research into how AA works, but it’d be good to figure out if SMART, LifeRing, and Women for Sobriety work in a similar way. That, Zemore said, will be one of her goals in future studies.

Why we need alternatives

In discussions about addiction treatment, AA and the 12 steps tend to prompt polarizing reactions — some people swear by the programs, others absolutely hate them.

There’s a good explanation for that: While the research shows that 12-step treatment can be as effective as professional treatment modalities like cognitive behavioral therapy, the research also shows that the 12 steps don’t work for everyone.

As one example, a prominent complaint about 12-step programs is the spiritual aspect. This is a big part of the 12 steps, with the final step even invoking “a spiritual awakening.” For people who aren’t religious or spiritual, this can be a big turn-off; that’s one reason SMART and LifeRing exist to begin with — they’re meant to be secular alternatives to the 12 steps.

The good news is that the research suggests the spiritual aspect doesn’t fully explain why the 12 steps are effective for some people. Instead, it seems other traits are just as, if not more, important — such as the social support that AA meetings provide and the lessons that participants can pick up at meetings.

That’s long led researchers to suspect that alternative mutual help groups could work. If so, that would let some people go to AA meetings if they prefer the 12 steps, while others could find SMART, LifeRing, Women for Sobriety, or something else that works for them. Basically, everyone could find a workable solution.

Providing these alternatives would essentially move addiction treatment closer to other kinds of medical problems. As Keith Humphreys, a drug policy expert at Stanford University, previously told me, “We don’t have anything that works for everybody. There’s very few places in medicine where you do.” So there need to be as many alternatives as possible.

The US is far from that at the moment. Most treatment facilities in America are, according to the survey data and research, at least partly based on the 12 steps — making it the only option for many people. While alternatives like SMART or LifeRing do exist, they’re not nearly as available as AA — and they certainly aren’t built into professional treatment programs in the same way as the 12 steps.

As Albert, a pseudonym for an AA member in Georgia, previously told me, “There’s just not a lot of widely advertised options available.” AA and 12-step treatment are “the most well-known and most recommended option, so that’s kind of where you tend to go.”

Zemore’s study begins to peel away at this problem. By showing that there really might be other effective options out there, the research provides hope that there may be a better — or at least more complete — solution out there for alcohol addiction.

"WASHINGTON, March 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Vanda) (NASDAQ: VNDA) today announced that HETLIOZ®, a circadian regulator, demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful benefits in nighttime and daytime symptoms of jet lag disorder. HETLIOZ® is currently approved in the US and Europe for the treatment of Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder, a rare and chronic circadian rhythm sleep disorder.

Jet lag disorder is a common circadian disorder frequently observed in millions of travelers who cross multiple time zones. Jet lag disorder is characterized by nighttime sleep disruption, a decrease in daytime alertness and impairment to social and occupational functioning.

The clinical efficacy results reported today are from the JET8 Phase-III clinical study (3107) (the JET8 study). In the JET8 study, 318 healthy volunteers were admitted to a sleep unit and were subjected to a circadian challenge of an 8 hours advance to their usual bedtime. The JET8 study design induced the circadian challenge experienced by travelers who cross 8 times zones, which leads to jet lag disorder. This clinical design allowed for the study of HETLIOZ® without the confounding effects of sleep deprivation and variable light conditions.

Results from the JET8 study showed significant and clinically meaningful effects of HETLIOZ® 20 mg on the primary endpoint of the study as well as multiple secondary endpoints. The pre-specified primary endpoint was the amount of sleep time in the first two thirds of the night. Secondary endpoints included measures of sleep parameters (TST, LPS, WASO) and next day alertness (KSS and VAS). (Table 1).

Table 1: Summary of Primary and Key Secondary Endpoint Results

Assessment Endpoint HETLIOZ® Placebo Difference p-value Summary p-value Detail

PSG TST 2/3 * 216.4 156.1 60.3 p<0.0001 3.29E-12

(minutes) TST full 315.8 230.3 85.5 p<0.0001 3.74E-14



LPS 21.8 36.8 -15.1 p<0.01 8.08E-03



WASO 144.6 219.1 -74.6 p<0.0001 3.41E-12

















KSS (1-9) average 4.0 4.5 -0.5 p<0.01 8.28E-03

VAS (0-100) average 60.8 54.2 6.6 p<0.01 9.89E-03



*Primary endpoint.

The results of the JET8 study shown above demonstrate the effectiveness of HETLIOZ® in treating jet lag disorder. The magnitude of the total sleep time benefit of 85 minutes improvement over placebo is significant and clinically meaningful. The demonstration of benefits in measurements of next day alertness on both KSS and VAS is meaningful and it underscores the ability of HETLIOZ® to address both nighttime and daytime symptoms of jet lag disorder.

Vanda previously reported on the JET5 study (3101) that examined the effects of HETLIOZ® in a circadian challenge of 5 hours advance of the subjects' usual bedtime. The results of that study were published in The Lancet in 2009.1 The observation that HETLIOZ® is effective in treating the symptoms caused by an abrupt advance of the circadian cycle of a magnitude of 5 or 8 hours suggests that HETLIOZ® will be an effective therapeutic tool in the treatment of individuals that experience symptoms of jet lag. HETLIOZ® will be potentially useful under circumstances of rapid eastward transmeridian travel experienced by frequent travelers, the rapid deployment of military troops and any circumstances that will necessitate the abrupt phase advance of the sleep wake cycle.

Jet lag disorder affects millions of individuals annually who cross multiple time zones during their travel. Jet lag disorder symptoms are more severe during eastward travel. It is reported that more than 30 million US residents make trips abroad each year to overseas destinations. Of these, 60% (approximately 20 million) travel to destinations in Europe, Middle East and Asia. It is also reported that 8% (approximately 1.6 million) travel in Business or First class.2

""We are extremely pleased with the outcome of this study which establishes the utility of HETLIOZ® in the treatment of jet lag disorder as HETLIOZ® was shown to overcome a significant circadian challenge of an 8 hour phase advance. This challenge is equivalent to eastward travel across 8 time zones as experienced for example on travel from Los Angeles to London, Washington DC to Moscow, Paris to Tokyo, or London to Singapore. HETLIOZ® improved both nighttime sleep and next day alertness potentially offering significant benefits to millions of travelers,"" said Mihael H. Polymeropoulos, MD, Vanda's President and CEO.

Vanda intends to seek marketing approval for the use of HETLIOZ® in the treatment of jet lag disorder. Vanda believes that if HETLIOZ® is approved by regulatory authorities for the treatment of jet lag disorder it will potentially offer a therapeutic solution to many travelers and will likely represent an important commercial opportunity for the company.

HETLIOZ® is a melatonin receptor agonist. HETLIOZ® has been granted market authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. For full U.S. prescribing information, please visit www.hetlioz.com.

Important Safety Information

The most common adverse reactions (incidence >5% and at least twice as high on HETLIOZ® (tasimelteon) than on placebo) were headache, increased alanine aminotransferase, nightmares or unusual dreams, and upper respiratory or urinary tract infection. The risk of adverse reactions may be greater in elderly (>65 years) patients than younger patients because exposure to HETLIOZ® is increased by approximately 2-fold compared with younger patients.

Indication

HETLIOZ® is indicated for the treatment of Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder (Non-24).

Important Safety Information

HETLIOZ® may cause somnolence: After taking HETLIOZ®, patients should limit their activity to preparing for going to bed, because HETLIOZ® can potentially impair the performance of activities requiring complete mental alertness.

The most common adverse reactions (incidence >5% and at least twice as high on HETLIOZ® than on placebo) were headache, increased alanine aminotransferase, nightmares or unusual dreams, and upper respiratory or urinary tract infection. The risk of adverse reactions may be greater in elderly (>65 years) patients than younger patients because exposure to HETLIOZ® is increased by approximately 2-fold compared with younger patients.

Use of HETLIOZ® should be avoided in combination with fluvoxamine or other strong CYP1A2 inhibitors, because of a potentially large increase in exposure of HETLIOZ®, and a greater risk of adverse reactions. HETLIOZ® should be avoided in combination with rifampin or other CYP3A4 inducers, because of a potentially large decrease in exposure of HETLIOZ®, with reduced efficacy.

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of HETLIOZ® in pregnant women. Based on animal data, HETLIOZ® may cause fetal harm. HETLIOZ® should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risks. Caution should be exercised when HETLIOZ® is administered to a nursing woman.

HETLIOZ® has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and is not recommended in these patients.

Safety and effectiveness of HETLIOZ® in pediatric patients have not been established.

Breast cancer test kits by genetic testing company 23andMe just received Food and Drug Administration approval.

The prescription-free test is the first to report on three specific BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast cancer gene mutations, according to the FDA.

By analyzing DNA collected through a saliva sample, the test detects increased risk of developing breast, ovarian or prostate cancer.

But “it has a lot of caveats,” warned Donald St. Pierre, acting director of the FDA's Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health. The test detects only three out of more than 1,000 known BRCA mutations. That accounts for a small percentage of people. Those most at risk of developing such cancers are of Eastern European Jewish descent.

“The test should not be used as a substitute for seeing your doctor for cancer screenings or counseling on genetic and lifestyle factors that can increase or decrease cancer risk,” he said.

These tests might help with prevention, but cannot diagnose cancer and cannot rule out your chances of getting cancer, 23andMe said.

Still, the company, which already tests DNA for other health risks as well as ancestry, said this cancer test is ""a step in the right direction.""

"Mayo study shows easy-to-use, noninvasive stimulation device can help prevent migraine attacks

SCOTTSDALE, Arizona - A migraine is much more than just a bad headache. Migraine symptoms, which can be debilitating for many people, are the sixth leading cause of disability, according to the World Health Organization. While there is no cure, a new study published in Cephalalgia in March shows single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation is a new way to prevent migraine attacks. It's safe, easy to use and noninvasive.

MULTIMEDIA ALERT: Video and audio are avaiable for download on the Mayo Clinic News Network.

Researchers at Mayo Clinic and other major academic headache centers across the U.S. recently conducted the study that examined the effectiveness of using a single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation device to prevent migraine attacks. The eNeura SpringTMS Post-Market Observational U.S. Study of Migraine study, also known as ESPOUSE, instructed participants to self-administer four pulses with the device in the morning and four pulses at night over three months to prevent and treat migraine attacks as needed. Spring TMS stands for Spring transcranial magnetic stimulation or sTMS.

""The migraine brain is hyperexcitable, and basic science studies have demonstrated modulation of neuronal excitability with this treatment modality,"" says Amaal Starling, M.D., a Mayo Clinic neurologist, who is first author of the study. ""Our study demonstrated that the four pulses emitted from this device twice daily reduce the frequency of headache days by about three days per month, and 46 percent of patients had at least 50 percent or less migraine attacks per month on the treatment protocol. This data is clinically significant. Based on the current study and prior studies in acute migraine attack treatment, sTMS not only helps to stop a migraine attack, but it also helps prevent them.""

""For certain patients, treatment options for migraines, such as oral medications, are not effective, well-tolerated or preferred,"" Dr. Starling adds. ""The sTMS may be a great option for these patients and allow doctors to better meet their unique needs.""

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration already had approved the sTMS device for the acute treatment of migraine with aura. The FDA now has approved it to prevent migraine, as well.

"(CNN) Corey Thomas admitted to his pharmacist that he hated the blood pressure medications a previous doctor had prescribed for him. They came with ""horrible"" side effects, he said, and so he rarely took them.

As a blood pressure monitor squeezed snugly around his arm, the pharmacist counseled Thomas, 49, on his diet and stress level while checking his blood pressure. She then helped Thomas find a medication better suited for his body.

Thomas was not at a health clinic or pharmacy or a primary care physician's office.

He was at the barbershop where he works in Inglewood, California. As part of a study, these health services were provided at his barbershop and others across Los Angeles County.

The study, published Monday in the New England Journal of Medicine , tested whether pharmacist-led programs in barbershops could significantly lower high blood pressure in black men in the United States.

Results from six months after the study, published in March , showed that when the guidance was coupled with medication, a blood pressure level of less than 130/80 was achieved among 63.6% of men who participated in the study's program, versus 11.7% of those who didn't.

Results from 12 months after the study show that when guidance was coupled with medication, a blood pressure measurement of less than 130/80 was achieved by 68% of men who participated in the study program, versus 11% of those who didn't.

""To a certain extent, I was surprised by the magnitude of the effect of the intervention,"" said Ciantel Blyler, a clinical pharmacist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles who was a co-author of the study.

""Especially once we sat down and looked at the blood pressure control rates and we were comparing the intervention group and the control group, I was sort of taken aback,"" she said.

Normal blood pressure levels for adults are 120/80 or less, and high blood pressure levels are 140/90 or higher, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Levels in between are considered at risk.

""The first number, called systolic blood pressure, measures the pressure in your blood vessels when your heart beats,"" the CDC says. ""The second number, called diastolic blood pressure, measures the pressure in your blood vessels when your heart rests between beats.""

Many older black men tend to avoid seeing the doctor until they have a serious health problem, and then they ""use the emergency room as a doctor,"" Thomas said.

""If it wasn't for the program, a lot of guys wouldn't have known they had high blood pressure,"" he said of the study. ""Unfortunately, I wish we had other programs to come in, too.""

On the other hand, the barbershop represents a safe haven in the black community -- a no-judgment zone -- where conversations about health and other personal topics are commonplace.

As a barber, ""we know more about our customers than their spouses do,"" Thomas said.

Shape your hair and your blood pressure

The prevalence of high blood pressure among black adults in the United States is among the highest in the world, according to the American Heart Association . More than 40% of non-Hispanic black men and women have high blood pressure.

Black Americans also develop high blood pressure more often and at an earlier age than whites and Hispanics, according to the CDC.

High blood pressure, which increases risk of heart disease and stroke, affects 1.13 billion people globally , according to the World Health Organization . More than one in five adults worldwide have high blood pressure, which causes about half of all deaths from heart disease and stroke.

Barber Eric Mohammad and Mark Sims, seated, checking Sims' blood pressure for the new study.

The new study included 319 black men across 52 black-owned barbershops in California's Los Angeles County. The men, 35 to 79 years old, had systolic blood pressure of 140 or more.

The researchers randomly assigned the men, based on their barbershop, to participate in the pharmacist-led program or to a control group between February 2015 and July 2017.

In the program group, barbers encouraged the men to meet with specially trained pharmacists at the barbershop to help monitor their blood pressure. The pharmacists could prescribe drug therapy under a collaborative agreement with the men's doctors.

At his barbershop, Thomas said, many customers were hesitant to open up to the pharmacists and doctors and to meet with them for health consultations.

""No one wanted to do it,"" he said. ""But by them being there -- they were in there every day -- and then we got used to them, and they warmed up to everybody. ... Then a lot of guys eventually were like, 'I'll go. Let me make sure I'm OK.' ""

Blyler said it didn't take long for the customers to warm up to her and her colleagues.

""They understood that we were there with good intentions. It was a very comfortable environment, and folks were very welcoming, and it really worked,"" she said.

In the control group, barbers encouraged the men to make lifestyle changes and doctor appointments, but not much else changed in their usual barbershop visits.

By the end of the study, the researchers found that the barbers' role in encouraging the men to monitor and improve their health resulted in a significant reduction in blood pressure, when coupled with medication from the pharmacists.

In participants assigned to the pharmacist-led program, the average reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were 21.6 and 14.9 greater, respectively, than in those assigned to the control group at six months, the researchers found.

At 12 months, the average reductions were ""statistically indistinguishable"" from the six-month data, according to the researchers.

'Medical mistrust has been an important barrier'

The study had some limitations, including that it was not blind, because both participants and researchers knew who was assigned to the pharmacist-led program and who was in the control group.

Additionally, more research is needed to determine whether similar study results would occur on a national level, since the study was conducted only in the Los Angeles area.

Also, pharmacists aimed to lower blood pressure in the program participants to less than 130/80, whereas the primary care providers of those in the control group probably targeted a blood pressure of less than 140/90.

The blood pressure goal of less than 130/80 is consonant with new clinical practice guidelines that were released last year, Blyler said.

The study appears to fall in line with previous research exploring the role barbershops could have in preventing death and disease in the black community, said Dr. Joseph Ravenell, an internist at NYU Langone Health and associate professor of Population Health and Medicine at NYU School of Medicine in New York.

Ravenell was not involved in the study, but he was among the first to research how interventions in barbershops could help black men access basic health care and improve various outcomes, such as high blood pressure or even colon cancer.

In a study published in the American Journal of Public Health in August, Ravenell and his colleagues found that helping black men in barbershops through the process of registering for a colorectal cancer screening led to those men being significantly more likely to get screened over six months.

The researchers found that 17.5% of men who received help were screened, compared with 8.4% of those who didn't receive the screening help.

""Medical mistrust has been an important barrier to African-Americans seeking health care, and so the barbershop -- where men go on a monthly basis and have an opportunity to develop a rapport with a trusted key opinion leader in the community -- that rapport is a perfect foundation for talking about health,"" Ravenell said.

""We know that when it comes to people being receptive to health messages, the setting and the mood that people are in can have an impact on how open they are to receiving those messages,"" he said. ""Since the barbershop is a place where men want to be, it's a place that's known for open collegial conversation, it really is a perfect place to relay health messages that are important for black men.""

In the years to come, as racial segregation laws limited the spaces where black Americans could gather, the barbershop served as a safe meeting space for the black community. In barbershops, black men could speak openly and honestly about a range of topics, including their health -- and that seems to continue today.

TUESDAY, March 13, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- A pill that combines three blood pressure-lowering drugs improves people's chances of lowering their high blood pressure, researchers report.

The pill contains low doses of the three medications -- telmisartan, amlodipine and chlorthalidone.

The finding stems from a study of 700 people, who averaged 56 years old. All had high blood pressure.

Among those who took the so-called ""triple pill"" for six months, 70 percent had achieved their blood pressure targets, compared with 55 percent of those who received their usual care. Usual care meant taking whatever blood pressure medicine their doctor prescribed.

The rate of side effects was no greater among those who took the three-in-one pill than among the usual care group.

""Based on our findings, we conclude that this new method of using blood pressure-lowering drugs was more effective and just as safe as current approaches,"" lead author Ruth Webster said in a news release from the American College of Cardiology. She's a researcher with the George Institute for Global Health at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia.

The study was presented Monday at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology in Orlando, Fla. The findings should be considered preliminary because research presented at meetings has not undergone the rigorous scrutiny given to research published in medical journals.

""The most urgent need for innovative strategies to control blood pressure is in low- and middle-income countries,"" Webster said. ""The triple pill approach is an opportunity to 'leapfrog' over traditional approaches to care and adopt an innovative approach that has been shown to be effective.""

High blood pressure increases the risk for heart attack, stroke and kidney problems.

""A control rate of 70 percent would be a considerable improvement, even in high-income settings,"" Webster said. ""Most hypertension guidelines in these countries do not recommend combination blood-pressure-lowering therapy for initial treatment in all people.""

The findings, she said, ""should prompt reconsideration of recommendations around the use of combination therapy.""

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration took a fresh step on Thursday towards setting a maximum nicotine level for tobacco products in a bid to lower tobacco-related deaths across the country, saying it would collect public comment and scientific research over the next three months.

FILE PHOTO: A woman disposes a cigarette in Los Angeles, California, May 31, 2012. REUTERS/Jonathan Alcorn

The move was part of a comprehensive plan the agency announced last summer to regulate tobacco and nicotine, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said on a call with reporters. That plan marked a major shift designed to give adult smokers a wider range of alternatives, including potentially less harmful e-cigarettes.

The agency is seeking to determine a level of nicotine in cigarettes and other tobacco products that would be minimally addictive or nonaddictive, according to a draft proposal.

It hopes setting such a standard would also help prevent teenagers who experiment with tobacco from becoming addicted.

The FDA estimates that setting such a standard would help 5 million smokers quit within a year and prevent more than 33 million teens and young adults from becoming regular smokers by the year 2100.

“There is no other single action our country can take that would prevent more young people from smoking or save more lives,” said Matthew L. Myers, president of Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.

Major tobacco players such as Altria Group and British American Tobacco are grappling with sales declines in the U.S. market and hoping to recoup revenue through novel tobacco and nicotine products such as e-cigarettes.

Altria Group has partnered with Philip Morris International to sell a novel device called iQOS, which heats but does not burn tobacco. The FDA is currently reviewing the iQOS application.

The FDA is seeking additional research and data for public review, Gottlieb said, as it tries to develop a nicotine product standard. Gottlieb said the FDA was also seeking public opinion on whether a product standard should be implemented all at once or gradually.

The comment period will be open through mid-June, said Mitch Zeller, director of FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products.

The FDA will continue to take enforcement actions against companies that inappropriately target children, including through the promotion of e-cigarettes, Gottlieb said.

James Figlar, executive vice president of research and development for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, part of British American Tobacco, said the company would work with the agency to create a path for alternative, less harmful tobacco products to reach the market.

The FDA will seek public input and scientific research on the role that flavors such as menthol play in tobacco addiction, and for the regulation of premium cigars, Gottlieb said.

“We’ll also advance key parts of our tobacco plan very soon,” he said."

"A new class of drugs could be life-changing for millions of women in menopause who suffer with hot flashes.

A medication being tested in the U.K. and here in the U.S. may be the key to alleviating several of the uncomfortable menopause side effects -- and hopefully without the need for hormone replacement therapy, according to an analysis published in the journal Menopause.

""The potential for this drug class to really improve many of the symptoms of the menopause, such as hot [flashes], difficulty sleeping, weight gain, and poor concentration, is huge,"" lead author Dr. Julia Prague of the Imperial College London. ""To see the lives of our participants change so dramatically and so quickly was so exciting, and suggests great promise for the future of this new type of treatment.""

About 70 percent of postmenopausal women experience vasomotor symptoms -— the familiar hot flashes -- which, in some cases, last for years. This new drug, labeled MLE4901 for research, is being tested in clinical trials and offers hope for curtailing postmenopausal symptoms.

The previous ""go to"" therapy was supplemental estrogen, which proved to have side effects like blood clots or even breast cancer.

MLE4901 is taken orally and works by blocking one brain chemical called neurokinin B from binding to its receptor. The interaction between these two has been linked to the regulation of temperature in the brain when someone is deficient in estrogen—like in menopause.

""We were able to identify this new therapeutic use for the compound -- which had previously been sitting on the shelf unused -- and within three years show this type of drug may make a tangible difference to the lives of millions of women,"" Professor Waljit Dhillo, an NIHR Research Professor from the Department of Medicine at Imperial College London said.

Previous studies showed that giving women an extra amount of the brain chemical neurokinin B resulted in hot flashes -- and genetic differences between people could be the reason why some have more of the chemical, or more severe postmenopausal symptoms, than others.

This small study done at the Imperial College of London involved 37 women between the ages of 40 and 62 years who did not have a period for at least 12 months, the definition of menopause, and who suffered at least seven hot flashes per day. The groups received either MLE4901 twice a day for 4 weeks, or a placebo pill on the same schedule. Two weeks later the groups swapped their treatments.

At the end of the study, those who took MLE4901 had the frequency of their hot flashes reduced by 72 percent and the severity of hot flashes decreased by 38 percent. This improvement started as early as three days after first taking the drug and relief continued for the whole month of treatment.

""We already knew this compound could be a game-changer for menopausal women, and get rid of three-quarters of their hot flushes in four weeks,"" Dhillo added. ""But this new analysis confirms the beneficial effect is obtained very quickly -- within just three days.""

Sleep and concentration improved after three days, too, which was an added bonus. The researchers noted that those improvements could have been related to the reduction in hot flashes.

All this is promising, but more research is needed and possibly a variation in the drug. A previous study on MLE4901 was associated with liver toxicity in a few participants, which resolved when they stopped taking it. They hope slightly modifying the drug may improve that side effect.

Larger studies on MLE4901 are underway in the U.S. and U.K. that will help gain an understanding of the drug’s safety and effectiveness. Like any new drug, safety and effectiveness have to be proven to the FDA before the drug can be offered in the U.S.

"Almost sixty years since the FDA approved the pill for birth control in women, a male version may finally be on the horizon. Researchers have developed a prototype male pill that appears to be safe in a month-long trial.

More attractive to many men than a long-acting injection or topical gel—both of which are in development—the prototype pill offers a “major step forward” in male contraception, Stephanie Page, a professor at the University of Washington in Seattle and senior investigator on the study, said in a statement.

The once-daily prototype pill suppressed certain hormones to the low levels you'd expect to see with effective longer-term contraceptives, results from an ENDO 2018, the Endocrine Society’s annual meeting in Chicago, abstract show.

The prototype pill—dimethandrolone undecanoate (DMAU)—is somewhat similar to the combined female pill, which contains estrogen and a steroid hormone. Rather than estrogen, DMAU uses a male hormone like testosterone.

Currently available forms of testosterone can exit the body too quickly for use in a once-daily pill. The “undecanoate” in DMAU, however, is a long-chain fatty acid that can slow the drug’s journey out of the body, Page said.

Eighty-three men took various doses of DMAU or a placebo for a month. Researchers analyzed the men’s hormones and cholesterol with blood tests at the start and end of the study. They found testosterone and two hormones needed for the production of sperm were notably suppressed in men who took the highest dose of DMAU.

While some subjects on all doses experienced mild weight gain, DMAU appeared safe. All participants passed safety tests including liver and kidney health checks.

“Despite having low levels of circulating testosterone, very few subjects reported symptoms consistent with testosterone deficiency or excess,” Page said. There were no significant changes in mood or sexual function, but a minority of participants did experience decreased libido during the study.

Page has high hopes for the results, calling them “unprecedented in the development of a prototype male pill.” Longer-term studies are the next step toward a once-daily male contraceptive pill, she said."

HealthDay Reporter

TUESDAY, March 20, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Tiny pellets could treat arthritic knee pain, delaying the need for knee replacement surgery, a small study has found.

Microparticles inserted into small blood vessels around the knee helped reduce the pain and improve function in eight arthritis sufferers, according to clinical trial results. The results were presented Monday at the Society of Interventional Radiology's annual meeting, in Los Angeles.

""Patients overall were able to improve their physical function in the knee after the procedure, and there were no adverse events related to this treatment,"" said lead researcher Dr. Sandeep Bagla.

Bagla is director of interventional radiology at the Vascular Institute of Virginia in Woodbridge. Boston Scientific, maker of the microparticles, funded the study.

Much of the pain that comes from knee arthritis actually stems from inflammation in the lining of the knee joint, also called the synovium, Bagla said. In fact, small blood vessels created by degenerative arthritis feed this inflammation by increasing blood flow to the lining.

To treat this, Bagla and his colleagues decided to try blocking those tiny blood vessels using microparticles -- spheres about a tenth of a millimeter in size made from a synthetic gel-like material.

The microparticles are inserted using a catheter run through a pinhole-sized incision, in a procedure that lasts between 45 and 90 minutes, Bagla said.

""It's an outpatient procedure, and no physical therapy is required before or after this procedure,"" he said.

The small pilot study -- the first U.S. clinical trial of this procedure -- involved 20 patients with moderate to severe arthritis pain. Only 13 had undergone the procedure by the time of Monday's annual meeting, and only eight had made it to the one-month follow-up, Bagla said.

Those eight patients averaged a 58-point decrease in pain, as measured on a 100-point visual scale used to estimate pain, Bagla said. They started with an average baseline of 72, which means their pain was brought down to manageable levels, he said.

Physical function of their knee also improved, based on an index used to judge the effects of osteoarthritis, Bagla added.

Overall, the two scales represented an 80 percent improvement in function, the researchers concluded.

Bagla said no side effects are expected because the procedure only blocks additional blood flow to the knee, rather than cutting it off altogether.

""You don't normally have this degree of increased blood supply to this lining. We're not blocking normal blood vessels to the knee or leg or bone or cartilage,"" he said.

Final results from this clinical trial are expected to be released this summer. Researchers are already kicking off a second, larger trial to better understand how the procedure works and which patients it might benefit, Bagla said.

They think it will be most appropriate for people between ages 40 and 70 who aren't ready to go through knee replacement, or people who are on chronic pain medication for their knee arthritis, Bagla said.

""Perhaps we can demonstrate and prove patients do not need to be on these medications and can alternatively go through a minimally invasive procedure like this to reduce their knee pain,"" Bagla said.

Dr. Suresh Vedantham, president of the Society of Interventional Radiology, called the new procedure ""very promising,"" given that it focuses on the inflamed knee lining that causes the pain.

""This therapy is very well-targeted to that particular mechanism, and certainly it should be investigated further,"" said Vedantham, who wasn't involved with the study. He's a professor of radiology and surgery at the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology at Washington University in St. Louis.

Research presented at medical meetings is typically considered preliminary until it is published in a peer-reviewed journal.

He contended that kratom does not act on the brain's opioid receptors the way prescription painkillers and heroin do. But back in 2016, the Journal of the American Chemical Society reported that kratom indeed works this way. Last month, an FDA study found that 22 of the 25 of the most prevalent compounds in kratom do bind to opioid receptors, and so should be considered an opioid. The study also said most deaths did occur in people who used kratom in addition to other drugs, though in one case, only kratom was detected.

"The Pap test has already reduced the incidence of cervical cancer by more than 60%. Now it may become a key step in the early detection of two other gynecological malignancies — ovarian and endometrial cancers — that have been notorious killers because they’re typically caught so late.

A new study has found that by genetically analyzing the harvest of cells from a Pap smear, doctors could identify 81% of endometrial cancers and 33% of ovarian cancers. Some of those cancers were in their earliest stages, when they’re more likely to respond to treatment.

When the Johns Hopkins University researchers tested an alternative means of collecting cells — a longer brush that sweeps cells from the lining of the uterus — they positively identified endometrial cancer in 93% of cases and ovarian cancer in 45% of cases.

And when they added a blood test to the ovarian cancer screening regimen, they were able to detect that deadly cancer in 63% of patients who had it.

“Having the possibility to detect these cancers earlier is very exciting,” said Dr. Nickolas Papadopoulos, a coauthor of the study, which was published Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine.

It’s the latest example of how scientists hope to detect cancer earlier and with greater precision by looking in blood and other easily accessible fluids for cells that bear the telltale genetic mutations of cancer.

While such “liquid biopsies” have not yet made their way into widespread use, they hold the promise of revolutionizing cancer screening.

In January, the same research team presented promising findings in the journal Science on a blood test called CancerSEEK that’s capable of detecting malignancies of the liver, stomach, pancreas, esophagus, colon, lung and breast. Earlier this week, they published findings in the journal eLife on a urine test to detect cancers of the urothelial tract or urinary bladder.

As a screening test for cervical cancer, the Pap smear has been a staple of gynecological checkups for more than six decades. It’s named for Dr. George Papanicolaou, the physician who first showed that cancerous cells of the cervix could be detected by microscopic inspection.

The Pap test has dramatically driven down deaths from cervical cancer, which used to be one of the most common cancers in women. However, the test does a poor job of detecting endometrial or ovarian cancer, which together kills about 25,000 women in the United States each year.

Women thought to be at high risk of those cancers are sometimes screened with a blood test that detects an immune system biomarker called CA-125, or with a transvaginal ultrasound that looks for telltale thickening of the uterus’ endometrial wall. But those tests fail to detect many cancers, and also send up a lot of false alarms. So they’re frequently not used until a woman complains of symptoms.

The result is often a diagnosis at an advanced stage, when treatments are more invasive and less likely to be successful.

Tumor cells from ovarian and endometrial cancers shed and are carried into the uterine cavity and endocervical canal, where they can be collected with the Tao brush or the Pap brush. (Y. Wang et al. / Science Translational Medicine )

In the new study, the researchers measured the accuracy of their PapSeek test on 1,658 women. They already knew that 1,002 of the women were free of either cancer and 656 of them had either ovarian or endometrial cancer.

Researchers collected cervical fluid samples with a Pap smear brush and a slightly longer tool called a Tao brush, which reaches beyond the cervix and into the uterus, nearer to where ovarian and endometrial cancers take hold. Then they used the PapSeek test to sequence the samples, focusing on 18 genes that tend to develop mutations in those cancers. The test also checked the samples for aneuploidy, the presence of abnormal numbers of chromosomes in cells.

When the researchers used the longer Tao brush, they were able to detect endometrial cancer in all but 7% of the women who had the disease, and close to half of the ovarian cancers. Combined with the fact that these tests were performed with a mere swipe of the uterine wall, these measures of “sensitivity” — the ability to detect cancers that are actually there — represent a major improvement over the screening tests currently available.

When they supplemented the analysis of Pap and Tao brush samples with a hunt for mutated cells in the women’s blood, they were able to detect ovarian cancer in well over half of those who had it.

When endometrial and ovarian cancers are especially aggressive and when they have progressed to advanced stages, they are easier to find with existing screening methods. But an important measure of a test’s usefulness is whether it can detect the most aggressive types of cancer before they have metastasized.

By that measure too, the PapSeek test looked promising. When it was used to scan the Tao brush samples, it identified 89% of the high-grade endometrial cancers in patients while their malignancy was still confined to the endometrium. It was also able to identify 80% of those with high-grade ovarian cancers before they had spread.

Just as important, the tests were remarkably good at avoiding false-positive signals, which would needlessly alarm women and lead to riskier and more-invasive tests to confirm a diagnosis. For both types of cancer, the PapSeek test’s “specificity” — its ability to accurately recognize the absence of disease — approached 100%.

Papadopoulos said he was surprised and heartened that the Pap test — or a close variant of it — could be repurposed to look for gynecological cancers that are typically caught way too late.

While the team hopes to improve the test’s sensitivity, he said that even this early version would likely boost women’s chances of earlier detection by a considerable margin.

“It doesn’t have to be perfect to help at least some women” who might otherwise die of these stealthy cancers, Papadopoulos said. “Women are already used to having Pap smears, and everyone can give a vial of blood.”

"ZURICH (Reuters) - Roche’s Tecentriq immunotherapy combined with other drugs boosted lung cancer patients’ survival versus an older cocktail, the Swiss company said as it seeks an edge on Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb.

Mixing Tecentriq with Avastin and carboplatin and paclitaxel boosted overall survival in first-line treatment of non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, Roche said on Monday, compared to patients who received only Avastin plus the two chemotherapies.

The latest trial success follows Roche’s announcement last week about a separate study in which Tecentriq mixed with chemotherapies carboplatin and Abraxane boosted progression-free survival, compared with chemotherapy alone, in first-line treatment of patients with advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer.

The Basel-based company, which had previously announced Tecentriq, Avastin and chemotherapy had reduced the risk of disease progression or death, said on Monday it hopes for a quick approval from authorities for the cocktail.

While Roche did not provide specific overall survival data, the headline result helps its bid to catch up to better-established immunotherapies from Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb and its shares rose about 1 percent in early trading.

“We are pleased the IMpower150 study demonstrated a clinically meaningful survival benefit for people receiving their initial treatment for this type of advanced lung cancer,” said Sandra Horning, Roche’s chief medical officer.

She also said the survival benefit was observed across key subgroups, including those with varying levels of a protein called PD-L1 that can help tumors avoid detection. This could help Roche make the case that its cocktail is suitable for broad patients groups, not just those with specific biomarkers.

The world’s biggest maker of cancer drugs is counting on growing sales of Tecentriq, which notched 487 million Swiss francs in 2017, to help offset falling revenue from its older cancer medicines Avastin, Rituxan and Herceptin whose patent expirations are exposing them to rivals’ cheaper copies.

Analysts from Baader Helvea said its announcement completes an “already robust” set of data for regulators who now must sign off on Tecentriq’s use as an initial treatment of lung cancer.

“We continue to see Roche efficacy more than sufficiently competitive to grant a 43 percent market share in the indication, translating in 4.9 billion francs Tecentriq peak sales and 1.2 billion francs in 2018,” Baader’s Bruno Bulic said.

“Facing biosimilar competition... we see Tecentriq sales coming timely to support Roche’s profitability going forward.”"	Roche's Tecentriq cocktail adds to lung cancer survival success	2018-03-26 09:40:20	https://www.reuters.com/article/us-roche-tecentriq/roches-tecentriq-cocktail-adds-to-lung-cancer-survival-success-idUSKBN1H20FP	story_reviews_00090	fake
"""If we can keep patients engaged, we can keep them in treatment longer,"" said lead researcher Dr. Judith Tsui of the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle.

The next phase of her research will compare a group of patients who use the monitoring app called emocha (ee-MOH-kuh) with those who don't to see if there's a difference.

At one Tennessee treatment center, some patients with opioid addiction are already using the app to upload selfies of their daily dose and answer questions about how they're doing.

""Every time they sign on, it allows us to capture data. Are they having cravings? Suicidal tendencies?"" said Scott Olson, CEO of Dallas-based Pathway Healthcare, which is trying the app at its Jackson, Tennessee, site. ""Maybe a phone call from a counselor might make the difference between staying clean and a relapse.""

Olson thinks insurers will pay for the service with more evidence. For monitoring tuberculosis patients, health departments pay roughly $35 to $50 per patient each month for systems that include encrypted data storage. A small health department might pay as little as $500 a month.

The idea of watching someone take their medicine — called directly observed therapy or DOT — has roots in tuberculosis where one person's forgetfulness can be serious for everyone. If patients don't take all their antibiotics, their infectious TB germs can get stronger, developing drug resistance and endangering the broader community.

But taking a handful of pills daily for up to a year is difficult, so public health departments traditionally sent workers to people's homes and workplaces to watch them take their doses. Today, many TB patients prefer remote monitoring. Nurses like it too.

Nurse Peggy Cooley has used Skype for years to chat live with patients taking TB medicine.

""We can accomplish in a two-minute phone call something that might have taken an hour to do and most of that hour was in the car,"" said Cooley, who works for the Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department in Washington state.

The new uploaded selfies don't need an appointment. They are a daily routine for many tuberculosis patients in Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Houston, where savings on mileage and worker time amounted to $100,000 in a recent year.

In Boston, Albuquerque and five other cities, researchers are studying whether the technology works for hepatitis C, a blood-borne virus that's surging among a new generation of injection drug users. New drugs for hepatitis C can cure, but they're expensive — $75,000 for a 12-week course of treatment — so insurers want to make sure patients take them.

""I think it holds a lot of promise,"" said researcher Dr. Alain Litwin of University of South Carolina School of Medicine, who's testing whether patients do better when someone watches them take their pills.

What's next? An insurer in Maryland plans to use the technology in diabetes and high blood pressure to make sure Medicare and Medicaid patients take their medicine. Startups selling the apps say they could be used by faraway adult children monitoring an elderly parent's daily pill-taking.

Experts worry about privacy, data security and penalties for poor pill-taking.

""That's the biggest ick factor,"" said Carolyn Neuhaus, a medical ethicist at the Hastings Center in New York. ""You can imagine a program where benefits are tied to compliance and the insurer says, 'We won't pay for medication anymore unless you're taking it correctly.'""

Globally, the rapid spread of smartphones creates an opportunity to eradicate TB, say the app developers.

But eliminating TB may take simpler, cheaper technologies that can be scaled for millions of cases, said Dr. Daniel Chin, who leads TB efforts for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

The group supports research in China and India on two homegrown technologies. China's tool, about the size of a child's shoebox, reminds patients to take their pills and saves data for review. In India, the government favors a blister pill pack printed with phone numbers; a patient punches out a daily pill, then calls the revealed number.

Worldwide, TB kills more than 1.6 million people annually, even though most deaths are preventable with treatment.

""If we are going to eliminate the disease, we need technology,"" said Dr. Richard Garfein of the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, who helped develop one of the smartphone apps, SureAdhere.

"LOS ANGELES (March 21, 2018)--Advanced stage liver tumors may be safely treated through image-guided injections of an immunotherapy approved for melanoma, according to a study presented today at the Society of Interventional Radiology's Annual Scientific Meeting.

Researchers found that talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC)--a genetically modified version of the herpes virus--can be safely administered into active cancer in the liver and stimulate the immune system to destroy cancer cells throughout the body.

""Advanced stage liver tumors, including ones that have spread from other locations, have limited treatment options because the patients can be in poor health; further, the complex structure of the organ can make it difficult to target with standard approaches,"" said Steven S. Raman, M.D., professor of radiology, surgery and urology at the David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, and lead author of the study. ""This minimally invasive treatment offers patients a novel way to directly and indirectly attack the cancer cells.""

Using image-guided needle injections, researchers at centers in the United States, Switzerland and Spain, treated 14 advanced-stage cancer patients with liver metastases, including those with cirrhosis. Patients were given escalating doses of T-VEC, up to the maximum FDA-approved dose for melanoma. Injection volume was based on lesion size. Researchers found the patients tolerated the treatment well with expected side effects, including temporary flu-like symptoms.

As part of the study, researchers will follow patients for up to two years, and new trials to investigate the effectiveness of the drug in treating advanced cancer in the liver are being planned. Additional investigation is also planned to test the therapy in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor to activate a stronger immune response.

""Image-guided treatments have expanded the options available for patients with liver cancer from innovative approaches to biopsies to resections to chemo,"" said Raman. ""This is an exciting way to look to the future, but patients living with advanced liver cancer should understand that this treatment will not be available for several years, except through clinical trials.""

The authors note several limitations of the current study, including the preliminary nature of the results, as well as the number of patients tested.

Amgen, the pharmaceutical company that makes T-VEC, was a sponsor of the trial.

Targeted immunotherapy treatment shows promise for treating advanced stage liver tumors	2018-03-29 06:00:00	https://web.archive.org/web/20180321084807/https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-03/soir-tit031318.php	news_reviews_00098	true
"A novel risk assessment tool helps identify which patients undergoing total hip replacement may be at higher risk for an implant dislocation after surgery, according to a new study from researchers at NYU Langone Health and described in the Best Poster in the Adult Reconstruction Hip at the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) 2018 Annual Meeting in New Orleans.

More than 310,000 hip replacements are performed in the United States each year, and an estimated 2.5 million Americans are currently living with hip replacements. In a hip replacement, an artificial joint comprising a ball and socket is implanted to replace the natural ball and socket in the pelvis, enabling movement that is typical of the hip joint. While dislocations only occur in about 1 percent of patients after hip replacement, certain individuals may be at a higher risk.

NYU Langone research presented at last year's AAOS Annual Meeting showed that spinal deformity was a significant risk factor for dislocation and subsequent revision surgery. The researchers reported at the time how the lumbar spine, or lower back, moves during posture changes like transitioning from sitting to standing, creating alterations in so-called spinopelvic relationship,"" which changes position of the hip socket and may cause an implant to dislocate in a person with spinal deformity.

This led researchers to further develop a risk prediction tool to better identify which patients undergoing a hip replacement may be at higher risk for dislocation, and then implement a treatment algorithm to help reduce that risk.

""Dislocation is a common reason for a total hip replacement to fail, and when it happens, sufferers can experience significant pain and require another surgery to fix the problem,"" explains lead study author Jonathan Vigdorchik, MD, an assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at NYU School of Medicine and associate fellowship director of the Division of Adult Reconstructive Surgery at NYU Langone Orthopedic Hospital. ""Orthopedic surgeons need to be more aware of this problem and think about the risk of dislocation prior to performing a hip replacement instead of just dealing with the complications after the surgery. We need to be proactive in our approach.""

What the Study Found

Some newer hip implants are designed with dual mobility cups that allow for increased range of motion, which helps reduce dislocation risk. However, no guidelines currently exist to aid clinicians in deciding when to use these more flexible implants, which are often more expensive than conventional implants, may not be medically necessary, and may carry added risks if implanted unnecessarily.

For the study, researchers reviewed data on 1,082 total hip replacements performed using computer navigation between January 2014 and December 2015, during which period no dual-mobility implants were used. The overall implant dislocation rate among this cohort was found to be 1.8 percent. Of this group, 320 patients had spinal disease and deformity as evidenced by imaging scans, and of them, 10 experienced dislocations, suggesting a dislocation rate of 3.1 percent for high-risk patients, or about three times higher than normal.

Beginning in 2016, surgeons used the standardized risk prediction model and treatment algorithm developed at NYU Langone, which factored in data collected from preoperative imaging taken while the patient was sitting and standing, and other measures that might affect risk for dislocation, including presence of a previous lumbar fusion. Using the risk assessment tool, the researchers identified 192 of 1,009 patients as high risk for a dislocation after surgery. All 192 patients underwent a total hip replacement through the high-risk algorithm, with dual mobility implants being used in 143 of the cases. The researchers reported only one dislocation in this high-risk group (or 0.5 percent of high-risk patients), compared with 3.1 percent in the previous group not assessed with the risk assessment and treatment algorithm. These findings represent a six-fold decrease in the rate of dislocation in the high-risk group.

""There were significantly fewer dislocations in the high-risk group once all of our patients were analyzed through our new treatment algorithm,"" explains study co-author Aaron J. Buckland, MD, an assistant professor of orthopedic surgery in the Division of Spine Surgery and director of spine research at NYU Langone. ""We were able to stop these implant dislocations from occurring in the first place, sparing our patients follow-up care and the need for revision surgery.""

All patients who undergo hip replacement at NYU Langone Orthopedic Hospital now go through the risk assessment screening and treatment algorithm prior to surgery. Other technologies including laser-guidance, computer navigation, and robotic surgical devices are used for the especially high-risk and complex cases identified through the algorithm in order to ensure the best possible outcome free of complications.

###

This research presented at the conference has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal and is currently in submission. Future studies aim to examine how the algorithm affects long-term outcomes and clinical benefits in patients at high risk for dislocation.

This poster, ""A New Risk-Assessment Score and Treatment Algorithm for Patients at High Risk of Dislocation following Total Hip Arthroplasty,"" was selected by the AAOS Central Program Committee as the Best Poster in the Adult Reconstruction Hip classification at the 2018 AAOS Annual Meeting.

"A new device worn like a visor can detect emergent large-vessel occlusion in patients with suspected stroke with 92 percent accuracy, report clinical investigators at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), Mount Sinai, the University of Tennessee Health Sciences Center and elsewhere in an article published online on March 6, 2018, in the Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery. Patients with large-vessel occlusions can then be routed to a Comprehensive Stroke Center with endovascular capabilities. In contrast, a standard physical examination achieved only 40 to 89 percent accuracy in identifying patients with large-vessel occlusion who could benefit from endovascular therapy.

The volumetric impedance phase shift spectroscopy (VIPS) device (Cerebrotech VisorTM, Cerebrotech Medical Systems, Pleasanton, CA) works by sending low-energy radio waves through the brain that change frequency when passing through fluids. Such waves are reflected back through the brain and then detected by the device. When a patient is having a severe stroke, the brain's fluids will change, producing an asymmetry in the radio waves detected by the VIPS device. The greater the asymmetry, the more severe the stroke.

Endovascular therapy within 24 hours is the standard of care for emergent large-vessel occlusion, but the chance of achieving a good outcome decreases by approximately 20 percent for each hour that passes before treatment.

The researchers hope that the device will save valuable time -- especially important in stroke where time is brain -- when it is deployed with emergency medical personnel in the field. This is because the accuracy of the device simplifies the decision made by emergency personnel about where to take patients first, according to Raymond D. Turner, M.D., professor of neurosurgery and chief of the Neuroscience Integrated Center of Clinical Excellence at MUSC. Turner served as principal investigator for MUSC in the VIPS for the Non-Invasive Detection of Hemispheric Bioimpedance Asymmetry in Severe Brain Pathology (VITAL) study reported in the article.

""Transfer between hospitals takes a lot of time,"" said Turner. ""If we can give the information to emergency personnel out in the field that this is a large-vessel occlusion, that should change their thought process in triage as to which hospital they go to.""

In the study, the VIPS device was deployed with emergency medical personnel in regions served by five Comprehensive Stroke Centers equipped with the endovascular capabilities to treat large-vessel occlusions that underlie severe stroke. Their goal was to use the device to accurately identify severe stroke and then compare the results to established physical examination methods practiced by emergency personnel such as the Prehospital Acute Stroke Severity Scale.

Both healthy participants and patients with suspected stroke were evaluated by emergency personnel using the VIPS device. Three readings were taken and averaged -- a process that takes about 30 seconds. Patients were also later evaluated by neurologists who provided definitive diagnoses using neuroimaging.

Compared to the neurologists' diagnoses, the device displayed 92 percent specificity -- the ability to detect the difference between patients with severe stroke and those with other conditions such as mild stroke or healthy participants with no brain pathology. This places the VIPS device above standard physical examination tools used by emergency personnel that display specificity scores between 40 and 89 percent.

The VIPS device is made by Cerebrotech Medical Systems, which paid consultants to analyze the neuroimaging data independently. The neuroimaging data was needed to teach the VIPS device which radio waves were indicative of stroke. Yet the consultants did not have access to the VIPS radio wave data during their review of the images, thereby eliminating the potential of the consultants to choose data that might artificially inflate the device's accuracy. It is also not clear how the device would work for patients with cranial implants, as metal interferes with the device's operating radio frequencies.

The device's success may be found in its ability to give emergency personnel a clear answer as to whether a patient is experiencing a severe stroke. The VIPS device requires very little training to operate compared to that required to learn standard emergency examination skills, thereby reducing the possibility of human error during emergency diagnosis.

In their next steps, the researchers are undertaking the VITAL 2.0 study to determine if the VIPS device can use complex machine learning algorithms to teach itself how to discriminate between minor and severe stroke without the help of neurologists. If so, the VIPS device could have widespread clinical implications, helping emergency personnel decide whether to take a patient to a comprehensive stroke center or a primary stroke center for treatment.

Turner likens the use of the VIPS device in detecting severe stroke to the use of electrocardiography (ECG) to definitively detect acute myocardial infarction. He predicts that the device has the potential to be used widely by emergency personnel but also to appear in other public spaces. ""This could potentially be something like a defibrillator,"" said Turner. ""You can find out if a patient is having a stroke, just like you can put a defibrillator on a patient to see if they're having a heart attack.""

"BOSTON -- Researchers from Hebrew SeniorLife's Institute for Aging Research, University of Western Australia, University of Sydney, and Edith Cowan University have discovered that bone density scans, typically used to determine fracture risk, could also be an aid in identifying cardiovascular disease. The study was recently published in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research.

Researchers analyzed the bone density scans of over 1000 older women from Australia for the presence of calcium deposits in the large artery in the abdomen called the aorta. They graded the severity of these calcium deposits using scans done for osteoporosis screening. They then followed the women for almost 15 years to determine the occurrence of cardiovascular disease within the cohort.

""We found that that the presence of calcifications increased the likelihood of having cardiovascular disease such as heart attacks, and even the likelihood of cardiovascular deaths and mortality in general."" Said Co-author Douglas P. Kiel, M.D., M.P.H., Director, Musculoskeletal Research Center at Hebrew SeniorLife's Institute for Aging Research. ""Our study highlights the fact that having a bone density test not only tells women about their risk of fracture, but also their long term risk for cardiovascular disease. This makes bone density testing even more useful in screening.""

"Leesburg, VA, March 13, 2018 - When compared to the screening population ages 50 and over, screening mammography in women ages 40-49 detects 19.3% additional cancers at the expense of an overall 1.5% increase in callbacks and 0.1% in increased biopsies, according to a study to be presented at the ARRS 2018 Annual Meeting, set for April 22-27 in Washington, DC.

The study to be presented by Abid Irshad of the Medical University of South Carolina examined the effectiveness of screening mammography between ages 40-49 in comparison to age groups 50-59 and 60-69. More than 41,000 screening mammography exams were examined for callbacks and recall rate, biopsies performed, cancers detected, and sensitivity and specificity of screening mammography.

Overall, 41,028 mammograms were performed with 5,196 callbacks (12.7% recall rate), 1,164 biopsies, and 326 cancers detected. Women ages 40-49 had 8,913 mammograms, 1,518 callbacks (17% recall rate), 306 biopsies, and 52 cancers detected. Women ages 50-59 had 13,288 mammograms, 1,659 callbacks (12.5% recall rate), 371 biopsies, and 103 cancers detected, while women ages 60-69 had 12,119 mammograms, 1,239 callbacks (10.2% recall rate), 302 biopsies and 89 cancers detected. Overall, the women ages 50 and over had a total of 31,385 mammograms, 3,504 callbacks (11.2% recall rate), 836 biopsies, and 270 cancers detected. By adding the women ages 40-49 to the screening population of 50 and over, the overall callback rate increased 1.5%, the biopsy rate increased 0.1% and 19.3% more cancers were detected.

The study results showed that there was a higher number of callbacks among women ages 40-49 compared to women ages 50-59 (17% compared with 12.5%) and to women ages 60-69 (17% compared with 10.2%). There was also a lower positive biopsy rate among women ages 40-49 compared with women over 50. The number of cancers detected in women ages 40-49 was not significantly different from women ages 50-59 or 60-69.

"LOS ANGELES (March 19, 2018)--A nonsurgical treatment could improve quality of life for patients with knee pain due to osteoarthritis, according to new research presented today at the Society of Interventional Radiology's 2018 Annual Scientific Meeting.

In the first U.S. clinical trial on geniculate artery embolization (GAE), a minimally invasive, image-guided treatment that blocks key arteries in the knee to reduce inflammation and pain, resulted in a majority of study participants achieving significant pain reduction and improvements in range of motion, avoiding more invasive measures.

""A majority of our patients with osteoarthritis of the knee saw significant pain reduction, not only just a few days after the procedure, but a month after as well, making this an accessible treatment for patients looking to improve their quality of life without surgery,"" said Sandeep Bagla, M.D., director of interventional radiology at the Vascular Institute of Virginia and lead author of the study. ""We are very encouraged by the results and the implications for the millions suffering from this common, yet debilitating condition.""

Interventional radiologists perform GAE for knee pain by inserting catheters through a pinhole-sized incision, blocking the very small arteries or capillaries within the lining of the knee, reducing the inflammation caused by osteoarthritis. As an outpatient treatment, GAE does not require open surgery or physical therapy, and takes 45-90 minutes to perform.

This prospective, multicenter clinical trial evaluated 13 patients with severe osteoarthritis pain. Each patient's pain and disability were measured along two scales, with evaluations before and after the treatment. The treatment was successfully completed in all 13 patients, with no adverse events. One month later, researchers followed the progress of eight patients and found that GAE significantly decreased pain (-58 mm on the Visual Analog Scale), reduced stiffness and increased physical function (-36.3 on the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index). Together the scales represent an 80 percent improvement in function compared with pre-procedure conditions.

""This procedure could have a significant impact in the treatment of osteoarthritis pain as a whole,"" said Bagla. ""The current mainstay of treatment in patients who have arthritis are pain medications, which come with significant side effects and risks. But GAE provides another option for patients struggling with pain and may even allow patients to avoid the painful recovery of knee surgery and the need for the kind of opioid pain medications associated with the dangerous epidemic in the United States.""

This study builds on the growing international research around GAE and osteoarthritis. While preliminary data shows that the treatment does work and is feasible, it has only been used in a clinical trial setting. The study has completed enrollment of 20 patients and final results are expected in summer 2018. A second randomized controlled clinical trial began in February 2018 and will provide further data on what types of patients are the best candidates for this treatment and how it could move toward clinical practice.

"A new study published in Nutrients shows that eating just 1.5 ounces of pecans - one small handful - every day may protect adults at risk for developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Conducted by researchers at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University, this study found that incorporating pecans into a typical American diet significantly improved insulin sensitivity and had a significant effect on markers of cardiometabolic disease in otherwise healthy overweight and obese adults with excess belly fat.

While a growing body of evidence has linked tree nuts such as pecans to reduced risk of CVD, this is the first study to look at the effects of pecan consumption on factors other than blood lipid levels and specifically those related to T2D. Obesity is a risk factor for T2D, and both obesity and T2D increase CVD risk.

""Pecans are naturally high in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, so replacing a portion of the saturated fat in the diet with these healthier fats can explain some of the cardio-protective effects we observed,"" said lead researcher, Diane McKay, Ph.D. ""But pecans also contain a number of bioactive plant compounds as well as vitamins and essential minerals that all likely contributed to this benefit. What's really interesting is that just one small change - eating a handful of pecans daily - may have a large impact on the health of these at-risk adults.""

In this placebo-controlled crossover study of 26 men and women (average age 59 years), all meals were provided to carefully control their food intake. For four weeks at a time, subjects ate either a control diet with no nuts or the same diet with pecans substituted for 15 percent of the total calories. Both the control diet and the pecan-rich diet were low in fruits, vegetables and fiber. Calorie levels, as well as protein, carbohydrate, and total fat, were kept the same.

"VANCOUVER, BC (March 26, 2018): A Vancouver-based research team led by Canada's most cited neuroscientist, Dr. Patrick McGeer, has successfully carried out studies suggesting that, if started early enough, a daily regimen of the non-prescription NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) ibuprofen can prevent the onset of Alzheimer's disease. This means that by taking an over-the-counter medication, people can ward off a disease that, according to Alzheimer's Disease International's World Alzheimer Report 2016, affects an estimated 47 million people worldwide, costs health care systems worldwide more than US$818 billion (1) per year and is the fifth leading cause of death in those aged 65 or older.

The Alzheimer's Association estimates that there are more than 5 million cases in the United States alone, with a new case being identified every 66 seconds. The annual cost to the country in 2017 is estimated have been $259 billion, with that figure predicted to potentially rise to $1.1 trillion by 2050. (2)

Dr. McGeer, who is President and CEO of Vancouver-based Aurin Biotech, and his wife, Dr. Edith McGeer, are among the most cited neuroscientists in the world. Their laboratory is world-renowned for their 30 years of work in neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease. A paper detailing Dr. McGeer's most recent discoveries were published Friday in the prestigious Journal of Alzheimer's Disease. (Journal of Alzheimer's Disease 62 (pp. 1219-1222).

In 2016, Dr. McGeer and his team announced that they had developed a simple saliva test that can diagnose Alzheimer's disease, as well as predict its future onset. The test is based on measuring the concentration of the peptide amyloid beta protein 42 (Abeta42) secreted in saliva. In most individuals, the rate of Abeta 42 production is almost exactly the same regardless of sex or age. However, if that rate of production is two to three times higher, those individuals are destined to develop Alzheimer's disease. That is because Abeta42 is a relatively insoluble material, and although it is made everywhere in the body, deposits of it occur only in the brain, causing neuroinflammation, which destroys neurons in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease.

Contrary to the widely held belief that Abeta 42 is made only in the brain, Dr. McGeer's team demonstrated that the peptide is made in all organs of the body and is secreted in saliva from the submandibular gland. As a result, with as little as one teaspoon of saliva, it is possible to predict whether an individual is destined to develop Alzheimer's disease. This gives them an opportunity to begin taking early preventive measures such as consuming non-prescription non-steroidal drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen.

""What we've learned through our research is that people who are at risk of developing Alzheimer's exhibit the same elevated Abeta 42 levels as people who already have it; moreover, they exhibit those elevated levels throughout their lifetime so, theoretically, they could get tested anytime,"" says Dr. McGeer. ""Knowing that the prevalence of clinical Alzheimer's Disease commences at age 65, we recommend that people get tested ten years before, at age 55, when the onset of Alzheimer's would typically begin. If they exhibit elevated Abeta 42 levels then, that is the time to begin taking daily ibuprofen to ward off the disease.

""Unfortunately, most clinical trials to date have focused on patients whose cognitive deficits are already mild to severe, and when the therapeutic opportunities in this late stage of the disease are minimal. Consequently, every therapeutic trial has failed to arrest the disease's progression. Our discovery is a game changer. We now have a simple test that can indicate if a person is fated to develop Alzheimer's disease long before it begins to develop. Individuals can prevent that from happening through a simple solution that requires no prescription or visit to a doctor. This is a true breakthrough since it points in a direction where AD can eventually be eliminated.""

"DALLAS - March 29, 2018 - A first-of-its-kind drug targeting a fused gene found in many types of cancer was effective in 93 percent of pediatric patients tested, researchers at UT Southwestern's Simmons Cancer Center announced.

Most cancer drugs are targeted to specific organs or locations in the body. Larotrectinib is the first cancer drug to receive FDA breakthrough therapy designation for patients with a specific fusion of two genes in the cancer cell, no matter what cancer type. The research appears in The Lancet Oncology.

""In some cancers, a part of the TRK gene has become attached to another gene, which is called a fusion. When this occurs, it leads to the TRK gene being turned on when it's not supposed to be and that causes the cells to grow uncontrollably. What's unique about the drug is it is very selective; it only blocks TRK receptors,"" said lead author Dr. Ted Laetsch, Assistant Professor of Pediatrics and with the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center.

Larotrectinib, targets TRK fusions, which can occur in many types of cancer. While the TRK fusions occur in only a small percentage of common adult cancers, they occur frequently in some rare pediatric cancers, such as infantile fibrosarcoma, cellular congenital mesoblastic nephroma, and papillary thyroid cancer, said Dr. Laetsch, who leads the Experimental Therapeutics Program (ETP) in the Pauline Allen Gill Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders at Children's Health in Dallas.

""Every patient with a TRK fusion-positive solid tumor treated on this study had their tumor shrink. The nearly universal response rate seen with larotrectinib is unprecedented,"" Dr. Laetsch said.

Among them was 13-year-old Briana Ayala of El Paso, who aspires to a career in fashion design. In 2016, Briana was found to have a rare tumor in her abdomen wrapped around her aorta, the largest artery in the body.

Surgeons in her hometown said it would be too dangerous to operate, so her family brought Briana to Children's Health in Dallas, where UT Southwestern Professor of Surgery Dr. Stephen Megison had to remove portions of her aorta while removing most of the tumor.

But the cancer started to grow again and no further treatments were available.

Dr. Laetsch sent her tumor for genetic testing and found that Briana's cancer had the TRK fusion, meaning the new drug might help.

Briana enrolled in the phase 1 clinical trial of larotrectinib and began taking the drug twice a day. Within weeks her pain and the swelling in her abdomen diminished, and scans showed her tumors had shrunk significantly.

Nearly two years later, Briana is back in school and playing with her dog, Goofy, and the family's seven parakeets. She's also been able to pick up her sketch pad and her dreams of a New York City fashion career.

""These are the kind of amazing responses we've seen with larotrectinib,"" said Dr. Laetsch, ""and this is why I'm so excited about it.""

The results of the larotrectinib trial in adult patients - a 75 percent response rate - were published last month in the New England Journal of Medicine.

The TRK-fusion mutation can be present in many types of cancers, including lung, colon, thyroid, and breast cancer, as well as certain pediatric tumors. TRK, short for tropomyosin receptor kinase, is a gene that plays a key role in brain and nervous system development and has a limited role in nervous system functions such as regulating pain in later life.

Larotrectinib belongs to a class of molecules known as kinase inhibitors, which work by cutting back on the enzymatic activity of a key cellular reaction. The selectivity of the drug means it does not cause the severe side effects associated with many traditional cancer treatments, and none of the patients with TRK fusions had to quit the study because of a drug-induced side effect.

Equally important, the response was long-lasting for most patients. ""For some of the targeted drugs in the past, many patients responded initially, but then resistance developed quickly. To date, the response to this drug seems to be durable in most patients,"" said Dr. Laetsch, who investigates the use of tumor molecular profiling to guide therapy in UT Southwestern's Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Division.

A next step in the research is a clinical trial involving a similar drug for those patients who developed resistance. Dr. Laetsch will be the national leader for that clinical trial in children.

"A new study has shown how the body's immune system responds to the new shingles vaccine, Shingrix, making it more than 90% effective at protecting against the virus.

The trial included more than 15,000 participants across 18 countries in Europe, North America, Latin America, Asia and Australia. Participants in the trial received two doses of the vaccine, with the doses given two months apart.

Lead researcher Professor Tony Cunningham from the Westmead Institute for Medical Research said the study shows that the vaccine stimulates production of a specific immune memory cell (CD4 T cells), generating a strong and sustained protection against the virus.

""The body has two types of immunity: protein antibodies and white blood cells known as T cells. As the virus circulates around the body, antibodies block it from entering cells. But when the virus does get into cells your T cells try to kill those infected cells.

""Our research shows that the vaccine stimulates your immune system to produce more antibodies and it generates a 24-fold increase in T cells. This is 12 times higher than other less effective shingles vaccines.

The research, published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, shows that Shingrix offers protection for up to four years, but Professor Cunningham believes it will last much longer.

""The second dose of the vaccine is important to ensure long-term protection,"" Professor Cunningham said.

""The efficacy is approximately 90% for all age groups--even for those over 70 years of age.

""This is quite remarkable because there are no other vaccines that perform nearly so well for people in their 70s and their 80s. We are seeing results comparable to those of childhood vaccinations.

""What's particularly exciting, though, is that 90% of recipients had an increased immune response sustained across the 3-year duration of the study.

""We anticipate that this protection will actually last much, much longer. We are now measuring the efficacy of the vaccine over the next 10 years and are very optimistic about the results,"" he said.

Shingrix is different from most other vaccines. Many vaccines are made from a weakened form of the virus, but Shingrix is made from just a single protein--known as glycoprotein E--that comes from the outer shell of the herpes zoster virus.

The vaccine also contains an adjuvant--a substance that helps your body fight off the virus. It is the first shingles vaccine to combine a non-live antigen with a specifically designed adjuvant.

Shingles is a viral infection, caused by the herpes zoster virus--the same virus that causes chickenpox. The incidence of shingles increases as we get older, because the body's natural immunity declines.

""When people reach their 50s and 60s, T cell immunity declines allowing shingles to strike. That's why our adult vaccine is directed specifically at T cell immunity,"" Professor Cunningham said.

Most Australian adults have been infected with the herpes zoster virus and are at risk of shingles, even if they do not remember having chicken pox. By age 85, approximately 50% of the population will develop shingles. Vaccination is the only way to protect against shingles.

"“We thought we’d be young forever,” said Francis, who co-anchors a radio news program in Washington, D.C. “The big wake-up call is when our bodies wear down.”

Take Elliott Francis, 64, who had his second hip replacement surgery in February. Growing up, he was “a jumper and a rebounder,” he said, scooping basketballs off the rim during Roxbury pickup games and later playing in high school and college.

For a generation that pounded its joints doing aerobics, running marathons, and carving up the ski slopes, it’s time to roll out the spare parts.

Baby boomers, determined to keep moving no matter what wear and tear and arthritis have wrought, are fueling a surge in joint replacements. Taking advantage of improved artificial joints and surgical methods, aging Americans are getting so many new hips, knees, shoulders, and ankles that orthopedic surgeons are having trouble meeting the demand.

Hip replacements in the United States more than doubled between 2000 and 2014 — from 160,282 to 371,605 a year — according to the most recent data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, which tracks hospital discharges. Knee replacements increased at an even faster clip in the same period, from 274,467 to 680,886.

The procedures can cost up to $50,000 for knees and $40,000 for hips, though the prices vary widely among Medicare and private insurers, which typically bear the bulk of the cost. The average age of patients listed in the American Joint Replacement Registry is about 66.

With millions more boomers still in their late 50s and early 60s, the trend will only continue.

“They’re aging, they’ve had some injuries, and they want to continue to be active into their 60s, 70s, and 80s. And they need a good joint to do that,” said Dr. David Mattingly, surgeon in chief at New England Baptist Hospital in Boston, one of the nation’s top orthopedics centers.

The surgical surge has created an expanding brigade of bionic baby boomers whose artificial parts are accompanied by sky-high expectations — something doctors struggle to manage. Despite steady improvement in technology and outcomes, replacement joints don’t create superhumans. Still, many patients are lifelong fitness buffs who begin plotting their return to the gym, the golf course, or the cross-country skiing trails the moment they are discharged from the hospital.

Winthrop retiree John Carver, 76, is already back at the fitness center after having replacement surgery on his right knee in February. “My goal is to get back to an hour — 30 minutes on the elliptical and some back exercises,” he said. A Marine veteran who ran the New York City Marathon the year he turned 40, Carver has scheduled a similar procedure on his left knee in May, early enough “to be ready for golf season.”

For those who are still working at physically demanding jobs, there are other considerations.

“I’m up and down the scaffolding all day,” said David Smith, 62, of Arlington, a construction superintendent in Boston who had a hip replacement in January. “My first focus was to just get on my feet so I can work another 10 years. So I said, ‘OK, let’s get this done.’ ”

Smith, who played hockey in college and as an adult and spent years lifting heavy equipment on building sites, plans to return to his job this spring. But he has already resumed golfing — on a March trip to visit his son and his family in Atlanta. And, he promised, “I will get on the skates again.”

Like Smith, many boomers endured months or years of pain before surgery, pain caused by “bone-on-bone” friction when cartilage deterioration eroded their bone cushioning. Some took multiple cortisone shots, hoping to avoid surgeries. But having had the procedures, many say they wish they’d done it sooner.

West Newbury’s town clerk, Mike McCarron,, 62, played high school and college football and once climbed Mount Washington in the winter. McCarron underwent two knee replacements simultaneously in 2011. “I had a coupon,” he joked. Now he runs on the treadmill at his Merrimack Valley gym and hikes in the Maine wilderness.

Susan Nadworny, 61, of Melrose, owned an aerobics studio in Boston’s North End during the 1980s and 1990s. There, she spent three or four hours a day leading high-impact exercise classes. Nadworny, who now works as a public policy advocate for people with disabilities, had knee replacement surgery last April. Nearly a year later, she pedals an indoor exercise bicycle and spends an hour a day walking dogs in the woods.

The vast majority of joint-surgery patients report much less pain and greater mobility afterward, with success rates topping 95 percent, according to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, a physicians organization. In patient-reported surveys, some still complain of pain and tissue inflammation after their procedures. Smaller numbers suffer serious complications, ranging from blood clotting to hospital-acquired infections.

New England Baptist expects to perform a record 7,000 knee and hip replacements at its Mission Hill campus this year, a nearly sixfold increase from the 1,200 annually it did in the mid-1980s. “Most of the busy guys do 15 to 20 a week,” Mattingly said.

Last year, the average salary for joint-replacement specialists topped $575,000, reported the Dallas consulting firm Merritt Hawkins & Associates, compared with just over $230,000 for family doctors.

Because of improvements in materials and the way they’re treated and sterilized, implants — which include polyethylene and titanium alloys — don’t wear down as fast as they once did. Implants now have a 90 percent chance of lasting two decades, much longer than in the past, Mattingly said.

While physical activity obviously plays a role in joint deterioration, genetics may be the biggest factor in determining who needs a replacement and when, he said. Knee replacements were first offered in the 1960s, and hip replacements began in the 1940s, so many boomers are facing the same surgeries their fathers and mothers underwent.

But boomers may have a tougher time coming to terms with the reality that a new body part doesn’t mean they can resume all of the high-impact activities that were a major part of their lives.

“Nobody will return to playing football,” Mattingly said. “The person who struggles is the one who’s done long-distance running for years and just doesn’t want to give it up.”

Technology could eventually change that. Joint implants have become more customized to suit individual patients, but a Billerica company is pushing the personalization trend further. ConforMIS Inc. uses 3-D printing and imaging software to more precisely tailor replacement joints. It sells between 17,000 and 20,000 personalized knee implants a year — still a small share of the market — and last year won US regulatory approval for its first hip implants.

“The baby boomer explosion is a big deal in health care,” said ConforMIS chief executive Mark Augusti. “Technology has to be part of the solution. Baby boomers expect to be more active as they get older and have higher expectations about quality of life in their later years.”

Stephanie Donvan, 60, of Arlington, who received a ConforMIS knee replacement in May, recalled feeling like she was “carrying a dead tree trunk” before the surgery.

Now, she said, “I’m out walking my Lab about five miles a day, every day. I can run in the snow and ride my bike. I have complete range of motion . . . We want to keep going till we’re in our 80s or 90s. We don’t want to give up all the things we’re doing.”

(CNN) Experts have proposed using medical marijuana to help Americans struggling with opioid addiction. Now, two studies suggest that there is merit to that strategy.

The studies, published Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine , compared opioid prescription patterns in states that have enacted medical cannabis laws with those that have not. One of the studies looked at opioid prescriptions covered by Medicare Part D between 2010 and 2015, while the other looked at opioid prescriptions covered by Medicaid between 2011 and 2016.

The researchers found that states that allow the use of cannabis for medical purposes had 2.21 million fewer daily doses of opioids prescribed per year under Medicare Part D, compared with those states without medical cannabis laws. Opioid prescriptions under Medicaid also dropped by 5.88% in states with medical cannabis laws compared with states without such laws, according to the studies.

""This study adds one more brick in the wall in the argument that cannabis clearly has medical applications,"" said David Bradford , professor of public administration and policy at the University of Georgia and a lead author of the Medicare study.

""And for pain patients in particular, our work adds to the argument that cannabis can be effective.""

Medicare Part D, the optional prescription drug benefit plan for those enrolled in Medicare, covers more than 42 million Americans, including those 65 or older. Medicaid provides health coverage to more than 73 million low-income individuals in the US, according to the program's website

""Medicare and Medicaid publishes this data, and we're free to use it, and anyone who's interested can download the data,"" Bradford said. ""But that means that we don't know what's going on with the privately insured and the uninsured population, and for that, I'm afraid the data sets are proprietary and expensive.""

'This crisis is very real'

The new research comes as the United States remains entangled in the worst opioid epidemic the world has ever seen. Opioid overdose has risen dramatically over the past 15 years and has been implicated in over 500,000 deaths since 2000 -- more than the number of Americans killed in World War II

""As somebody who treats patients with opioid use disorders, this crisis is very real. These patients die every day, and it's quite shocking in many ways,"" said Dr. Kevin Hill , an addiction psychiatrist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, who was not involved in the new studies.

""We have had overuse of certain prescription opioids over the years, and it's certainly contributed to the opioid crisis that we're feeling,"" he added. ""I don't think that's the only reason, but certainly, it was too easy at many points to get prescriptions for opioids.""

Like opioids, marijuana has been shown to be effective in treating chronic pain as well as other conditions such as seizures, multiple sclerosis and certain mental disorders, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse . Research suggests that the cannabinoid and opioid receptor systems rely on common signaling pathways in the brain, including the dopamine reward system that is central to drug tolerance, dependence and addiction.

""All drugs of abuse operate using some shared pathways. For example, cannabinoid receptors and opioid receptors coincidentally happen to be located very close by in many places in the brain,"" Hill said. ""So it stands to reason that a medication that affects one system might affect the other.""

But unlike opioids, marijuana has little addiction potential, and virtually no deaths from marijuana overdose have been reported in the United States, according to Bradford.

""No one has ever died of cannabis, so it has many safety advantages over opiates,"" Bradford said. ""And to the extent that we're trying to manage the opiate crisis, cannabis is a potential tool.""

Comparing states with and without medical marijuana laws

In order to evaluate whether medical marijuana could function as an effective and safe alternative to opioids, the two teams of researchers looked at whether opioid prescriptions were lower in states that had active medical cannabis laws and whether those states that enacted these laws during the study period saw reductions in opioid prescriptions.

Both teams, in fact, did find that opioid prescriptions were significantly lower in states that had enacted medical cannabis laws. The team that looked at Medicaid patients also found that the four states that switched from medical use only to recreational use -- Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington -- saw further reductions in opioid prescriptions, according to Hefei Wen , assistant professor of health management and policy at the University of Kentucky and a lead author on the Medicaid study.

""We saw a 9% or 10% reduction (in opioid prescriptions) in Colorado and Oregon,"" Wen said. ""And in Alaska and Washington, the magnitude was a little bit smaller but still significant.""

The first state in the United States to legalize marijuana for medicinal use was California, in 1996. Since then, 29 states and the District of Columbia have approved some form of legalized cannabis. All of these states include chronic pain -- either directly or indirectly -- in the list of approved medical conditions for marijuana use, according to Bradford.

The details of the medical cannabis laws were found to have a significant impact on opioid prescription patterns, the researchers found. States that permitted recreational use, for example, saw an additional 6.38% reduction in opioid prescriptions under Medicaid compared with those states that permitted marijuana only for medical use, according to Wen.

The method of procurement also had a significant impact on opioid prescription patterns. States that permitted medical dispensaries -- regulated shops that people can visit to purchase cannabis products -- had 3.742 million fewer opioid prescriptions filled per year under Medicare Part D, while those that allowed only home cultivation had 1.792 million fewer opioid prescriptions per year.

""We found that there was about a 14.5% reduction in any opiate use when dispensaries were turned on -- and that was statistically significant -- and about a 7% reduction in any opiate use when home cultivation only was turned on,"" Bradford said. ""So dispensaries are much more powerful in terms of shifting people away from the use of opiates.""

The impact of these laws also differed based on the class of opioid prescribed. Specifically, states with medical cannabis laws saw 20.7% fewer morphine prescriptions and 17.4% fewer hydrocodone prescriptions compared with states that did not have these laws, according to Bradford.

Fentanyl prescriptions under Medicare Part D also dropped by 8.5% in states that had enacted medical cannabis laws, though the difference was not statistically significant, Bradford said. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid, like heroin, that can be prescribed legally by physicians. It is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine, and even a small amount can be fatal, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse

""I know that many people, including the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, are skeptical of cannabis,"" Bradford said. ""But, you know, the attorney general needs to be terrified of fentanyl.""

'A call to action'

This is not the first time researchers have found a link between marijuana legalization and decreased opioid use. A 2014 study showed that states with medical cannabis laws had 24.8% fewer opioid overdose deaths between 1999 and 2010. A study in 2017 also found that the legalization of recreational marijuana in Colorado in 2012 reversed the state's upward trend in opioid-related deaths.

""There is a growing body of scientific literature suggesting that legal access to marijuana can reduce the use of opioids as well as opioid-related overdose deaths,"" said Melissa Moore , New York deputy state director for the Drug Policy Alliance. ""In states with medical marijuana laws, we have already seen decreased admissions for opioid-related treatment and dramatically reduced rates of opioid overdoses.""

Some skeptics, though, argue that marijuana legalization could actually worsen the opioid epidemic. Another 2017 study , for example, showed a positive association between illicit cannabis use and opioid use disorders in the United States. But there may be an important difference between illicit cannabis use and legalized cannabis use, according to Hill.

""As we have all of these states implementing these policies, it's imperative that we do more research,"" Hill said. ""We need to study the effects of these policies, and we really haven't done it to the degree that we should.""

The two recent studies looked only at patients enrolled in Medicaid and Medicare Part D, meaning the results may not be generalizable to the entire US population.

But both Hill and Moore agree that as more states debate the merits of legalizing marijuana in the coming months and years, more research will be needed to create consistency between cannabis science and cannabis policy.

""There is a great deal of movement in the Northeast, with New Hampshire and New Jersey being well-positioned to legalize adult use,"" Moore said. ""I believe there are also ballot measures to legalize marijuana in Arizona, Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and South Dakota as well that voters will decide on in Fall 2018.""

Hill called the new research ""a call to action"" and added, ""we should be studying these policies. But unfortunately, the policies have far outpaced the science at this point."""

Blindsided by the news his tailbone pain was caused by a life-threatening tumor, Tracy sought information and opinions. His doctor referred him to specialists at a major medical center in San Francisco. He learned surgery is the most common treatment. But, a surgeon told Tracy and wife, Karin Rittenberg, he should prepare for possible complications.

Said Tracy, ""We were told that I should prepare myself for the loss of functionality below the waist – including bowel, bladder and sexual functions. Even with surgery, there was a high risk of recurrence. That's when we began to research other options, such as radiation therapy.""

Treatment options

The couple then met with a radiation oncologist. The doctor explained in cases where surgery is not an option or the outcome of surgery was unacceptable, people turn to definitive radiation therapy. He provided Tracy and Karin with a copy of a published research paper on chordoma and the effects of definitive radiation. The lead author and researcher was Dr. Peyman Kabolizadeh, clinical director, Beaumont Proton Therapy Center in Royal Oak. While the findings were written for health care professionals and very technical, Tracy was encouraged.

""Definitive radiation therapy refers to curative radiation,"" explained Dr. Kabolizadeh. ""Radiation is the only treatment the patient receives."" In his study published in the International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics, he and his colleagues found, ""in circumstances where surgery may result in significant neurologic or organ dysfunction, patients can be treated definitively with radiation therapy alone. The results supported the use of high-dose definitive radiation therapy, via proton beam therapy, for selected patients with unresected spine and sacral chordomas.""

The San Francisco radiation oncologist not only shared Dr. Kabolizadeh's research paper, but also his contact information. Both Tracy and Karin learned about the differences between photon and proton radiation. They did their homework on treatment options, but for Tracy it became quite frustrating. Karin persisted in her fact-finding, when Tracy was down emotionally.

""You have to understand, because this cancer is so rare, there is limited research available,"" Tracy said. ""That was the truly scary part about making any decisions.""

Second, third and more opinions

They conferred with Dr. Kabolizadeh at Beaumont in Michigan by telephone. The couple also traveled to a highly-regarded cancer center in New York City.

""It seemed everyone I spoke with had a different opinion,"" said Tracy. ""I then determined, definitive radiation therapy was the way to go, but I had to decide which type and where. There was photon therapy available in San Francisco, but, in my research, I found out the photon beams don't stop at the tumor and have a greater possibility of affecting surrounding organs, too. I liked what I heard about the advantages of proton beams precisely targeting the tumor and stopping, sparing nearby tissue from harmful radiation.""

Deciding on proton therapy

Several factors went into Tracy's decision to choose proton therapy at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak. Not only were he and Karin impressed with the advanced cancer killing capabilities of the pencil beam proton therapy, but also with the expertise of Dr. Kabolizadeh.

""I looked at survivability, length of life and quality of life. Right now, I'm living life to the fullest and have a beautiful wife. We travel, entertain friends and are diehard Giants fans,"" explained Tracy. ""Beaumont has the most advanced equipment, and someone who is familiar with treatments for my rare cancer. I felt that gave me the best chance of success. Dr. Kabolizadeh has the vehicle and knows how to drive it! Every time we spoke, he was honest, open and candid. His candor was refreshing.""

About 3 months after his cancer diagnosis, Tracy traveled to Royal Oak in late January to begin his proton treatments. On Tuesday, April 3, he completed his nine weeks of treatment.

He not only looks forward to watching his beloved Giants at AT&T Park, but hanging out with his dog Neyo. And Karin looks forward to him shaving the ""treatment beard"" he has been growing since his treatments began.

Beaumont proton team 'second to none'

""I realize I'm extremely fortunate to have been able to consider traveling to another state for treatment and live there for two and a half months,"" said Tracy. ""I'm also fortunate that Karin's company has been supportive of her working remotely so she could stay with me. And I'm so grateful for the tremendous outpouring of love and support we've received from our family and friends during our stay in Michigan. That helped keep our spirits high.""

And when asked about his treatment experience, Tracy remarked, ""Every single person that I've engaged with at Beaumont has been a delight. They all made what could have been a difficult experience tolerable. The facilities are impressive, clean and welcoming, but the difference is the people – best hospital staff I've ever encountered. The team in the Proton Therapy Center is second to none.""

About Beaumont's Proton Therapy Center

Beaumont's center is one of just 28 proton therapy centers in the U.S. It is the only operational proton therapy center in Michigan.

How proton therapy works

Proton therapy is a high-tech alternative to X-ray radiation. A scanning beam of proton radiation with online image guidance offers greater precision to destroy cancerous cells, sparing adjacent healthy tissue with fewer side effects.

Proton therapy uses positively charged atomic particles, traveling up to two-thirds the speed of light, to fight cancer. A cyclotron, or particle accelerator, creates protons from hydrogen molecules. The proton beam is sent to the treatment room through a transport system consisting of magnets, called the beam line, finally arriving in the gantry, a device that rotates around the patient. The beam is directed to the patient through a nozzle that targets the tumor.

While proton therapy is not effective against all cancers, it is effective in treating many solid and localized tumors.

Advanced technology

""Our IBA ProteusOne single-room treatment system includes precision technologies,"" said Dr. Kabolizadeh. ""Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy, which combines Pencil Beam Scanning and 3-D Cone Beam CT, can target a tumor within less than a millimeter.""

Pencil Beam Scanning refers to the delivery of protons in a thin beam. Like a pencil, the beam uses back and forth motions to target the treatment area – the shape, size and depth. It ""paints"" a radiation dose on tumors layer by layer. Compared to X-ray beams, which pass through a patient, proton beams deliver targeted radiation to the tumor and then stop – resulting in no exit dose.

Radiation oncologists at Beaumont are well versed in precise image guidance, having developed cone beam CT technology almost 20 years ago.

Dr. Kabolizadeh explained, ""Image guidance allows doctors to visualize tumors during therapy to assess response and make sure the tumor is treated correctly every day.""

Comprehensive cancer care

Proton therapy is an important addition to Beaumont's comprehensive arsenal of leading-edge cancer treatments. Beaumont's Radiation Oncology department is ranked among the nation's best for advanced technology, innovative treatment and research. Advanced radiation treatments developed at Beaumont include adaptive radiation therapy, image-guided radiation therapy, intensity-modulated arc therapy, high-dose rate brachytherapy and hyperthermia therapy.

"Scientists at the University of Waterloo have developed a new tool to protect women from HIV infection.

The tool, a vaginal implant, decreases the number of cells that the HIV virus can target in a woman's genital tract. Unlike conventional methods of HIV prevention, such as condoms or anti-HIV drugs, the implant takes advantage of some people's natural immunity to the virus.

HIV infects the body by corrupting T cells that are mobilized by the immune system when the virus enters a person's body. When the T cells stay resting and do not attempt to fight the virus they are not infected and the HIV virus is not transmitted between people. When the T cells stay resting, it's referred to as being immune quiescent.

""We know that some drugs taken orally never make it to the vaginal tract, so this implant could provide a more reliable way to encourage T cells not to respond to infection and therefore more reliably and cheaply prevent transmission,"" said Emmanuel Ho, a professor in the School of Pharmacy at Waterloo. ""What we don't know yet is if this can be a stand-alone option for preventing HIV transmission or if it might be best used in conjunction with other prevention strategies. We aim to answer these questions with future research.""

Ho's implant was inspired by previous research involving sex workers in Kenya. In Kenya, Ho and research partner Keith Fowke of the University of Manitoba, observed that many of these women who had sex with HIV positive clients but did not contract the virus. They later found the women possessed T cells that were naturally immune quiescent.

""Observing this, we asked ourselves if it was possible to pharmacologically induce immune quiescence with medication that was better assured of reaching the point of infection,"" said Ho. ""By delivering the medication exactly where it's needed, we hoped to increase the chances of inducing immune quiescence.""

The implant is composed of a hollow tube and two pliable arms to hold it in place. It contains hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) which is disseminated slowly through the porous material of the tube and absorbed by the walls of the vaginal tract.

The implants were tested in an animal model and the team observed a significant reduction in T cell activation, meaning that the vaginal tract was demonstrating an immune quiescent state.

The article recently appeared in the Journal of Controlled Release.

"Researchers have discovered a new class of drug that has the potential to help cancer patients who no longer respond to existing therapies.

The drug may not become available to patients for a number of years yet, but researchers believe that if clinical trials are successful, it could be used to tackle a variety of treatment-resistant cancers.

Patients with breast cancer for example frequently become resistant to existing hormone-based treatments, leading to the disease becoming fatal.

In a bid to come up with new forms of treatment that work in a distinct way from established ones, chemists, biologists and clinicians at Imperial College London collaborated on creating a new drug, the properties of which are reported in the journal Molecular Cancer Therapeutics.

The team of scientists at Imperial was funded by Cancer Research UK. The drug was then developed by Imperial, in collaboration with Emory University in the USA.

Early lab-based tests of ICEC0942 were successful in targeting resistant breast cancers and indicated minimal side effects. ICEC0942 was then licenced to Carrick Therapeutics, who developed it into a molecule named CT7001, which they have taken to early-stage clinical trials in less than two years.

The first patient was given the drug in November 2017 as part of Carrick's a Phase I clinical trial to assess its safety and how well it can be tolerated. The trial is still ongoing, so results are not available yet.

Professor Charles Coombes, from the Department of Surgery & Cancer, said: ""Treatment-resistant tumours represent a significant threat for patients, as once a cancer stops responding to treatments there is increasingly little clinicians can do.

""Drugs such as these could help to shift the balance back in favour of the patients, potentially providing a new option to patients for who existing treatments no longer work.""

Professor Tony Barrett, from the Department of Chemistry, said: ""This work is the result of extensive collaboration between chemists, biologists and clinicians, which has helped to bring a new treatment from discovery to clinical testing in record time, streamlining the process.""

The drug targets an enzyme called CDK7, involved in directing cells through their lifecycle, which consists of growth, DNA replication and cell division. CDK7 is also involved in the process of transcription, a vital step in gene expression - the creation of proteins to carry out cell functions. Particular cancers, such as treatment-resistant breast cancers, have a unique dependence on transcription, meaning targeting CDK7 may be particularly effective.

By inhibiting transcription, ICEC0942 shuts down the ability of the cancer to spread. As well as breast cancers, cancers such as acute myeloid leukaemia and small-cell lung cancer are particularly transcription-dependent, so ICEC0942 may work well for these too, especially where they have become resistant to other treatments.

The discovery of the drug was spurred by an initial meeting between Professor Anthony Barrett, from the Department of Chemistry, and oncologist Professor Charles Coombes from the Department of Surgery & Cancer.

Professor Simak Ali, also from the Department of Surgery & Cancer, was working on understanding the action of CDK7 in treatment-resistant breast cancer. Professors Coombes and Ali suggested CDK7 as a drug target, leading the collaboration to attempt to design a molecule that would inhibit its action.

From early attempts, a large collaborative team was eventually founded for drug discovery from 'bench to bedside', directed by Dr Matthew Fuchter in the Department of Chemistry. Possible compounds for CDK7 inhibition were modelled using computational drug design, aided by collaboration with Emory University.

Ultimately, a candidate molecule called ICEC0942 suppressed tumour growth in a wide range of cancer types in lab tests. In addition, laboratory studies showed ICEC0942 worked better in combination with traditional hormone therapies for estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cells, which have not yet become resistant. It is this molecule, in oral pill form, that was taken forward by Carrick as CT7001 and is currently in Phase I clinical trials. If the Phase I trial proves successful, the compound must pass further stages of trial over the next few years before it becomes available to patients.

Early funding for the study came from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), and a major contribution of whole-project funding was from Cancer Research UK. Licensing of the technology to Carrick Therapeutics was led by Cancer Research UK's Commercial Partnerships Team and Imperial Innovations, the Technology Transfer Office of Imperial, with support from Emory University.

Dr Iain Foulkes, Cancer Research UK's executive director of research and innovation, said: ""It's exciting to see how Cancer Research UK's partnerships with both academia and industry are bringing urgently needed new tests and treatments to patients.

""Drug resistance continues to be a major challenge across many cancer types so it's vital that we explore new ways to tackle tumours that have stopped responding to standard therapies. We hope that this promising new class of drug will offer more options to patients who have few left available to them, and help more people survive their cancer.""

"Adding the monoclonal antibody drug trastuzumab--already used to treat certain breast cancers--to the chemotherapy regimen of women with a rare form of uterine cancer lengthens the amount of time their tumors are kept from growing, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine researchers conducting a small phase II trial of the regimen, testing its safety and value.

The results of the trial, published online ahead of print on March 27 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, show that the drug extended the length of time to tumor progression by four to eight months in the seven-year trial. The researchers say this may lead to new national guidelines for treating this cancer subtype, known as uterine serous carcinoma.

Uterine serous carcinoma makes up less than 10 percent of all cancers of the endometrium, or lining of the womb, diagnosed in the United States each year, but it accounts for more than a third of the 10,000 endometrial cancer deaths annually. The aggressive carcinomas often don't cause symptoms until they've begun to spread throughout the body. As a result, the average time that standard chemotherapy and surgical treatments can keep the tumor from growing or spreading--known as progression-free survival--is only about eight months.

""The fact that these tumors grow rapidly, but also have a propensity to spread to lymph nodes and other organs very early, is a double whammy for women,"" says Amanda Fader, M.D., associate professor of gynecology and obstetrics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and first author of the new study.

Fader and her colleagues knew that about 30 percent of all uterine serous carcinomas test positive for HER2/neu, a receptor protein that is also overexpressed in about 10 percent of all breast cancers. Trastuzumab binds to and blocks HER2/neu, keeping it from driving tumor growth, and has been shown to be effective in so-called HER2 positive breast cancers.

From August 2011 through March 2017, Fader, Alessandro Santin, M.D., professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Yale University, and collaborators at 11 other cancer treatment centers in the U.S. randomly assigned 61 women with uterine serous carcinoma, being seen at the participating institutions, to receive either the standard chemotherapeutic regimen--a combination of the drugs carboplatin and paclitaxel--or those drugs plus trastuzumab. Some 41 of the patients had stage 3 or 4 uterine serous carcinoma--known as advanced disease--and 17 had recurrent uterine serous carcinoma. All tested positive for the HER2/neu receptor.

Among all patients, the 28 controls receiving only the standard carboplatin and paclitaxel combination had an average progression-free survival time of eight months, and the 30 who received trastuzumab in addition had an average progression-free survival time of 12.6 months. However, the difference was even more profound in the 41 patients with advanced disease, whose progression-free survival time went from an average of 9.3 months to 17.9 months with the addition of trastuzumab.

""Even an improvement of a few months may be quite meaningful for women with these cancers,"" says Fader, who is also affiliated with the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins.

Among patients with recurrent disease, progression-free survival time increased from an average of six months to 9.2 months. The difference, Fader says, may be that these patients have been heavily treated in the past, are more likely to have overall poorer health and are more likely to have mutated or heterogeneous tumors, or tumors with different levels of HER2 expression.

Follow-up studies of the women who remain alive--who now number 35--continue, the researchers say, to track the impact of trastuzumab on overall survival time even after tumor progression. But the results of the trial, they add, were strong enough to warrant submission to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, which guides the design of standard treatment plans around the country.

Fader cautions that a larger study of the drug combination, or other combinations, is needed to confirm the findings and potentially extend survival even more. She notes that using trastuzumab to selectively treat uterine serous carcinoma that express HER2/neu is part of a broader trend at Johns Hopkins and other cancer centers to use the tools of tailored therapy, or precision medicine, based on the molecular and genetic makeup of tumors and patients.

"CHICAGO - Screening patients for diabetes based solely on their age and weight - a recommendation from a leading medical expert group - could miss more than half of high-risk patients, according to a new Northwestern Medicine study of a nationwide sample. These limited screening criteria also missed more racial and ethnic minorities, most notably Asians.

Failing to screen high-risk adults could lead to delayed treatments to prevent type 2 diabetes or manage the condition for those who already have it, possibly contributing to a worsening of the diabetes epidemic. Prediabetes and diabetes affect half of U.S. adults with an estimated cost of $327 billion per year.

The United States Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF) currently recommends that physicians screen patients for dysglycemia (prediabetes or type 2 diabetes) when they are 40 to 70 years old and are overweight or obese. By following this recommendation, 53 percent of patients who had prediabetes or type 2 diabetes would not be screened. The study showed that screening patients using an expanded set of risk factors, which the USPSTF suggests but does not formally recommend, would identify most cases of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.

Only 23 percent of patients with prediabetes or diabetes would be missed if expanded screening criteria were used to make screening decisions, the study found. The expanded criteria include a family history of diabetes, history of gestational diabetes or polycystic ovarian syndrome or non-white race or ethnicity.

""This seems like a no-brainer to screen patients who have any of these additional risk factors,"" said lead author Dr. Matthew O'Brien, assistant professor of medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. ""By demonstrating how well these expanded criteria work in identifying patients with prediabetes and diabetes, we're proposing a better path for the USPSTF to strengthen its screening guidelines.""

The study was published today, Friday, April 13, in the Journal of General Internal Medicine. O'Brien will be presenting his findings today at the Society for General Internal Medicine conference in Denver, Colorado. This is the first study to report how these expanded screening criteria would perform in practice among a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults.

The USPSTF has come under scrutiny for other screening recommendations, most notably for breast cancer. But there has been little attention focused on this group's most recent diabetes screening guideline.

Intensive lifestyle programs and some medications have been proven to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes among adults with prediabetes. A large volume of research over the last three decades has demonstrated that treating type 2 diabetes prevents life-threatening complications such as heart attacks, strokes and kidney failure.

""The earlier patients are diagnosed with these conditions, the sooner they can begin to combat them,"" O'Brien said.

African-Americans and Latinos develop type 2 diabetes at younger ages, so waiting until they are 40 years old to screen them is problematic, O'Brien said. In the study, 50 percent of whites with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes were identified using the limited criteria compared to only 48 percent of African-Americans and only 44 percent of Latinos.

Asians are at high risk of developing diabetes even at a healthy weight. By following the limited guidelines and only screening patients who are overweight or obese, approximately 30 percent of Asians with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes would be identified. That would leave 70 percent of Asians with prediabetes or diabetes undiagnosed until their next screening test, which could occur years later.

The study also touches on the financial implications of these guidelines. Under a provision in the Affordable Care Act, all services recommended by the USPSTF must be fully covered by insurers. But O'Brien said it is unclear whether insurers will be required to pay for diabetes screening if patients only meet the expanded criteria.

""This could be a particular problem for people of low socioeconomic status who are at high risk of developing diabetes and may be unable to pay for a screening test,"" O'Brien said.

The study was conducted collaboratively with the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), using data collected every year from a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. It builds on findings from a previous study O'Brien conducted that incorporated electronic health record data from 50,515 adult primary care patients at community health centers in the Midwest and Southwest between 2008 and 2013.

"I love my local YMCA for many reasons beyond my daily swim. Top of the list: the friendships and conversations in the locker room that are frequent sources of valuable information, connections and motivation. For example, I recently overheard a discussion about Y members and friends of members who had experienced devastating attacks of shingles, including one woman who nearly lost an eye and another who was left with unrelenting nerve pain.

That was the push I needed to end my procrastination about getting the new shingles vaccine, Shingrix, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration last October after studies involving 16,600 people showed it to be far more effective at preventing this disease than the first shingles vaccine, Zostavax, which I had had a decade earlier. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people 50 and older, including those previously immunized with Zostavax, should now get the Shingrix vaccine.

The process was surprisingly simple and less costly than I had anticipated (list price is $280 for the two-part shot without insurance). All I needed was a prescription from my doctor. I took it to my local pharmacy, where a staff pharmacist administered the vaccine. I’ll get the second part the same way in May. My Medicare Part D insurance covered it with a $40 co-pay for each part. (The cost may be higher if the vaccine is administered in a doctor’s office, so check first.)

Many millions of Americans, especially those older than 40, are susceptible to an eventual attack of shingles, caused by the very same virus that causes chickenpox. Once this virus, varicella zoster, infects a person, it lies dormant for decades in nerve roots, ready to pounce when the immune system is weakened, say, by stress, medication, trauma or disease. One-third of Americans eventually get shingles, but the risk rises with age, and by age 85 half of adults will have had at least one outbreak of shingles."

"DANVILLE, Calif., April 11, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Palo Alto Health Sciences, Inc. (PAHS), developer of the drug-free Freespira® treatment for panic attacks and other symptoms of panic disorder, today announced that another study has demonstrated clinically significant symptom improvement, with 80% of patients panic attack free one year after treatment.

This latest study, conducted as part of the VITAL Program at Allegheny Health Network in Pennsylvania, also demonstrated a 50% reduction in healthcare costs in patients with panic symptoms 12 months after being treated with Freespira.

A Symposium at the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA) Annual Conference in Washington, DC focused on the impact of abnormal breathing patterns on anxiety-related conditions and treatments as reported in five studies. Two studies reported nearly 80% of Freespira-treated patients were panic attack free at 12 months post-treatment. Two additional studies reported that patients with mixed anxiety disorders and low exhaled CO2 at baseline were less responsive and/or discontinued treatment with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or Acceptance Commitment Therapy.

Early data from a fifth study reported on Freespira treatment for patients with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Ninety percent of patients in this study experienced a significant improvement in PTSD symptoms at two months and six months post-treatment.

Symposium Chair David Tolin, Ph.D., Director of Anxiety Disorders Center, The Institute of Living, and Adjunct Professor of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, commented, ""Studies of the Freespira treatment have shown that this innovative approach to treating patients suffering from panic symptoms and panic attacks not only significantly reduces or eliminates these symptoms in approximately 80% of patients, but also results in meaningful reduction in health costs.""

Debra Reisenthel, CEO of Palo Alto Health Sciences, added, ""Patients with panic symptoms and panic attacks have 3-5 times higher medical costs than patients without panic due to higher utilization of medical resources, including ED visits, physician visits and prescription drugs.""

Freespira is both easy to use and effective. Once a licensed healthcare provider authorizes the treatment and after a single training session, the patient uses Freespira at home, performing two 17-minute breathing sessions a day over a four-week period, after which the treatment is complete. The peer-reviewed published multi-center Freespira clinical trial, presented by Dr. Tolin, demonstrated that 71% of patients were panic attack free immediately after treatment and 79% of patients were panic attack free 12 months post-treatment.

About Freespira

Freespira is an FDA-cleared, drug-free, four-week at-home treatment for panic attacks and other panic symptoms. Treatment is authorized and completed under the supervision of a licensed healthcare provider. Freespira is clinically proven to reduce or eliminate panic attacks and other symptoms of panic disorder, a mental health condition in which debilitating anxiety leads to life-altering avoidance behaviors. Individuals with panic chronically hyperventilate, even when not experiencing a panic attack. This abnormal breathing pattern has been shown to exacerbate attacks. Freespira works by training the patient to stabilize respiration rate and exhaled carbon dioxide levels, which reduces or eliminates panic attacks.

About Palo Alto Health Sciences, Inc.

Palo Alto Health Sciences, Inc. is a privately held digital therapeutic company revolutionizing behavioral healthcare with evidence-based, non-invasive, drug-free solutions. Their first product, Freespira, is an FDA-cleared treatment for individuals suffering from panic disorder, panic attacks and other symptoms of panic. In the United States, over 6.7 million adults annually suffer from panic disorder; panic attacks affect a total of 27 million adults in the U.S. every year and are a common component of other anxiety disorders.

By Steven Reinberg

HealthDay Reporter

MONDAY, April 16, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- People with chronic back pain often try painkillers and other treatments without success. Now, a new study suggests a program of education and exercise may provide relief.

Helping patients think differently about pain and encouraging them to move in ways they previously feared appears to ease pain and improve function, researchers say.

""People with chronic neck and/or back pain should be educated about their pain, [and] should be reassured,"" said lead researcher Anneleen Malfliet.

They should ""learn to put pain into the right perspective, should remain active or increase their activity levels gradually, and should avoid fear of moving,"" said Malfliet, of Vrije University Brussels in Belgium.

Physical therapists and doctors can guide patients in this process, she added.

""They should also avoid the use of scary, unreassuring labels or diagnoses,"" and not limit movement in therapy, she said.

To test the experimental approach, Malfliet and her colleagues randomly assigned 22 men and 38 women to the program. They assigned another 25 men and 35 women to standard care -- exercise, and back and neck education.

""The experimental therapy, focusing on functionality, not using pain as a reliable symptom, and not as a guideline to adapt movements or activities, leads to better treatment outcomes,"" Malfliet said.

The program led to a significant and clinically important reduction of pain, she said.

Patients in the program reported 50 percent less pain after the treatment. They also reported paying less attention to pain.

In general, they also had less disability, a reduced fear of moving, and improvement in mental and physical outlook, according to the study authors.

""These positive effects were found until the last follow-up measurement at one year after treatment,"" Malfliet said.

The program involves ""pain neuroscience education with cognition-targeted motor control training,"" she said.

What does that mean?

Pain neuroscience education aims to change patients' beliefs about pain, to increase their knowledge of pain and to decrease its threat, Malfliet said.

Besides focusing on the makeup of the spine, the program stressed lifting techniques and stretching. Participants also learned the value of strength, endurance and fitness training.

Many back patients are afraid certain movements will cause them pain, so they avoid them. The new exercises are designed to help overcome that fear, Malfliet said.

The regimen included the best known exercises for back pain and general exercises, she said. It also included group classes, online activities and personalized training sessions.

""Be active, and move without fear of pain or reinjury,"" Malfliet said. ""Your level of activity or way of moving before the chronic pain began should be used as a guideline target.""

Whereas back pain studies involving exercise and drugs have shown changes to the brain's gray matter, the program in this study found no brain changes, Malfliet said.

Dr. Kiran Patel is director of neurosurgical pain at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.

Patel said the dual mental and exercise approach is used to treat phantom pain in patients after a limb amputation. It's rarely used for back pain, she said.

But this study suggests these methods also can help reduce spinal pain, she said.

""The program, however, is quite time-intensive and is not covered by insurance,"" Patel said.

""Although it's promising, we really have to see the benefit long-term to justify the cost,"" she added.

The report was published online April 16 in JAMA Neurology.

"The reports underscore the increasingly important first-line role that immunotherapy, which unleashes the immune system to destroy cancer cells, is taking against the deadliest cancer.

AD

“Immunotherapy is rapidly, in combination with other treatments and on its own, dramatically changing the standard of care for lung cancer,” said Leena Gandhi, an oncologist at NYU Langone Health who led the study on the immunotherapy-chemotherapy combination, called Keynote-189. “Instead of chemo being the backbone on which to improve, immunotherapy is now the backbone on which we build.”

AD

Lung cancer is the second-most-common malignancy in the United States, after breast cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates that 234,000 people will be diagnosed with the disease this year, and 154,050 will die of it.

Most patients diagnosed with advanced lung cancer — disease that has spread beyond its original site — initially receive chemotherapy, which provides only marginal benefit. But the disease is so lethal that many patients don’t survive long enough to try second- or third-line treatments, so researchers are trying to develop and use more effective approaches earlier.

AD

The trial that grabbed much of the spotlight Monday is a randomized effectiveness study that involved more than 600 untreated patients with advanced nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer — a common type of the disease. The patients did not have cancer-causing mutations. One group was treated only with chemo, while the other got an immunotherapy drug called Keytruda plus chemo. Some of the results had been released previously, but not specific details.

AD

After a median follow-up time of 10.5 months, Gandhi said, the patients in the combination group were 51 percent less likely to die, compared with patients in the chemo-only arm.

“For the first time, adding another drug has significantly impacted the long-term outlook for those patients,” she said.

AD

Scientists who weren't involved in the study agreed that it was highly significant. H. Jack West, an oncologist at Swedish Medical Center in Seattle, said, “It is literally practice-changing — immediately.”

Roy Herbst, an oncologist at Yale Cancer Center said that most lung cancer patients now will be offered immunotherapy in some form much earlier than before. Still, he said, the approach was not a cure and there is a lot of room for improvement. The estimated proportion of patients in the combination therapy group who were alive and whose disease had not gotten worse at a year was about 34 percent, about double the proportion for the chemo-only group.

AD

Last May, the Food and Drug Administration approved the Keytruda-chemo combination based on an early-stage trial. But many doctors did not adopt it because the trial was small and didn’t initially show a survival benefit, Gandhi said.

AD

Experts said it was especially significant that the study showed that patients benefited from the Keytruda-chemo combination regardless of the levels of a protein, called PD-L1, found on their cancer cells. Researchers already had known that patients with high levels of the protein were more likely to respond to immunotherapy.

Last week, in a related development, Merck, which makes Keytruda, reported that a different trial showed that the medication prolonged survival even when used alone, compared with chemo. Experts said they will have to see more details before they can determine whether the medication is better used alone or with chemo.

AD

In a second study published Monday, researchers used two other immunotherapy medications — Opdivo and Yervoy, both made by Bristol-Myers Squibb — to treat newly diagnosed patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with a high number of mutations in their tumors.

AD

The patients experienced a significantly longer period during which their disease did not worsen, compared with people who received only chemotherapy, said Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center oncologist Matthew Hellmann, who led the study.

He said the results established the double-immunotherapy combination as a first-line treatment for patients with a high “tumor mutational burden,” but that it was too early to know whether the treatment leads to longer survival. And he said the trial showed that “tumor mutational burden” is a reliable way to predict who will benefit from the medications.

AD

Another study published Monday used immunotherapy in a different way — for patients with early-stage lung cancer. Researchers at Johns Hopkins and Memorial Sloan Kettering gave patients two doses of Opdivo — the first a month before surgery, the second two weeks before the operation — to try to stimulate anti-tumor activity and reduce the risk of relapse.

AD

Nine of the 20 patients who got Opdivo had a “major pathologic response” — a sharp reduction in the number of cancer cells found in the tumors removed by surgery.

Drew Pardoll, director of Hopkins’ Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, said that it is too early to know whether the findings will translate into longer survival. But if future studies show that, he added, then immunotherapy might be used to augment or even replace chemo typically given before surgery.

"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A late-stage trial of Amgen Inc’s experimental drug Aimovig found that it reduced episodic migraines by at least half in 30 percent of patients who had failed up to four previous treatments, while 14 percent of placebo patients achieved that goal, the company said on Tuesday.

The 12-week trial, presented this week at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology, involved 246 patients suffering four to 14 migraine headaches a month who had tried two to four preventive treatments that either did not work for them or had intolerable side effects.

“This is a trial in really difficult to treat patients,” professor Uwe Reuter, trial investigator and managing medical director at Charité Universitätsmedizin in Berlin, told Reuters in a telephone interview. He said previous studies excluded patients who had tried more than two other treatments.

Reuter said the 17-point gap between the treatment and placebo groups was in line with previous Aimovig studies.

Aimovig, currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, is likely to be the first drug in a new class designed to target calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which plays a key role in migraine activation. A decision by the FDA is due by May 17.

Amgen has partnered with Novartis AG to co-commercialize Aimovig in the United States, while Amgen has rights to the drug in Japan and Novartis has rights to commercialize in rest of world. The drug, a monoclonal antibody, was given monthly by injection at a dose of 140 mg for the trial.

Similar drugs are under development at companies including Eli Lilly & Co and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, but Amgen emphasizes that Aimovig is the only one that targets the CGRP receptor pathway, rather than CGRP itself.

Aimovig has the “potential to help fill treatment gaps in more difficult patient populations whose migraine has not been adequately managed with current therapies,” Sean Harper, executive vice president of research and development at Amgen, said in a statement.

Amgen said Aimovig trial patients also had statistically and clinically meaningful improvements in secondary trial goals including fewer monthly migraine days and better physical function.

Researchers said no Aimovig patients stopped treatment due to side effects, while around 1 percent of placebo patients discontinued because of side effects.

"Scientists have announced the development of a highly accurate and reliable technique for diagnosing prostate cancer. The Dundee University-based team say they have used an ultrasound process called shear wave elastography (SWE) to detect prostate tumours. The method is non-invasive and cheaper than current detection techniques.

Prostate cancer has become the most common cancer in men in the UK. One in eight men will develop the condition at some point in their lives with more than 47,000 new cases being diagnosed every year. Men aged 50 or over, men with a family history of prostate cancer, and black men are at greatest risk of developing the condition.

“Current diagnosis of prostate cancer is extremely inefficient, leading to unnecessary treatments for many patients,” said the Dundee University team’s leader, Professor Ghulam Nabi. “Our new method is far more accurate and also allows us to identify the difference between cancerous and benign tissue in the prostate without the need for invasive surgery.”

The prostate is a small gland in the male reproductive system and is normally about the shape and size of a walnut. Current methods for determining if a prostate has become cancerous include a physical examination of the prostate (known as a digital rectal examination or DRE), MRI scans, a biopsy or tests to determine levels of the chemical prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the blood.

Each carries problems. PSA results can be unreliable; a DRE is not good at identifying which cancers are benign and which need treatment; MRI scans cannot always give a definitive answer; while a biopsy carries a risk of infection and is expensive.

The new method aims to get round the problems by targeting the prostate with ultrasound. Cancerous tissue is stiffer than normal tissue so shear waves are slowed as they pass through a tumour.

“We have been able to show a stark difference in results between our technology and existing techniques such as MRI,” added Nabi. “The technique has picked up cancers which MRI did not reveal. We can now see with much greater accuracy what tissue is cancerous, where it is and what level of treatment it needs. This is a significant step forward.”

The trial tests involved around 200 patients. “Now we need to use this on a wider scale to build more data but there is clearly the potential to really change the way we manage prostate cancer,” Nabi said.

SWE technology is already used in diagnosing breast cancer and liver diseases. However, to make it applicable to prostate cancer a special probe had to be developed by the team.

“The technique now needs to be tested in a much larger number of men to confirm just how well it can detect the aggressive cancers, while also ruling out those who do not have prostate cancer,” said Simon Grieveson, head of research funding at Prostate Cancer UK, which funded the Dundee project (with support from the Movember Foundation).

“With an average of one man dying every 45 minutes from prostate cancer in the UK, the need for a more reliable test that can identify dangerous forms of the disease earlier is greater than ever.”

In the past few years, a number of celebrities have revealed that they had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and have joined campaigns to raise awareness of the disease, including Michael Parkinson, Ian McKellen and most recently Stephen Fry, the comedian and former rector of Dundee University, who this year described how he had surgery to deal with a prostate tumour.

“This breakthrough comes at a time when prostate cancer is being pushed to the forefront of our consciousness in the UK, not least because of the disturbing upward trend in its prevalence,” said Fry. “It is therefore doubly exciting to hear of the new techniques in diagnostic imaging.

HealthDay Reporter

THURSDAY, April 26, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- After a stroke, many patients are given the clot-busting intravenous drug alteplase, but another drug may be more effective, Australian researchers report.

Among more than 200 stroke victims, TNKase (tenecteplase) was about twice as effective as alteplase in restoring blood flow to the brain, and it also resulted in less disability, the scientists found.

""Tenecteplase is likely to become the preferred medication for clot-dissolving in stroke patients,"" said lead researcher Dr. Bruce Campbell, head of the stroke department at the Royal Melbourne Hospital in Parkville. ""It is likely to change stroke treatment guidelines and clinical practice.""

Campbell said tenecteplase is more effective than alteplase because of differences in the enzymes in each drug.

Although both drugs work in the same way, tenecteplase is better at attacking and dissolving clots, and more resistant to factors that inhibit the breakdown of clots, he said.

For either drug to be most effective, it needs to be given as soon as possible after a stroke occurs. In this study, patients were given the drugs within 4.5 hours after the onset of a stroke, Campbell said.

Although tenecteplase appears to be more effective for stroke patients, it's not approved for that use in the United States, according to Dr. Rohan Arora, director of stroke at Long Island Jewish Hospital in Forest Hills, N.Y.

In 2000, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved tenecteplase for use after a heart attack, Arora said.

""Tenecteplase is being widely used in developing countries, such as India,"" he said. ""One reason is it's cheaper than alteplase.""

In the United States, tenecteplase costs about $5,800, versus alteplase, which costs $8,000, Arora said.

In addition, tenecteplase is easier to give, requiring only a single injection, while alteplase requires an injection and an IV drip, he added.

Arora explained that tenecteplase is not widely used in the United States for heart attack patients because these patients are typically treated with angioplasty or heart bypass surgery.

For the new study, which did not receive drug company funding, Campbell and his colleagues randomly assigned 202 stroke patients to either alteplase or tenecteplase before surgery to remove clots.

The researchers specifically looked to see which drug was better at restoring blood flow to clot-blocked blood vessels in the brain, and which drug resulted in patients having better outcomes.

The investigators found that 22 percent of the patients treated with tenecteplase had more than 50 percent of blood flow return to the brain, compared with 10 percent of those treated with alteplase.

Patients treated with tenecteplase also had better functional outcomes after 90 days than those given alteplase, the findings showed.

Bleeding into the brain, the most serious side effect of either drug, occurred in 1 percent of patients, regardless of which drug they received, Campbell said.

The report was published April 26 in the New England Journal of Medicine.

"There are no laboratory tests to diagnose migraines, depression, bipolar disorder and many other ailments of the brain. Doctors typically gauge such illnesses based on self-reported symptoms and behavior.

Now, a new study shows that a kind of brain scan called functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) - which shows how brain regions interact - can reliably detect fundamental differences in how individual brains are wired. As such, the technique potentially could be used to distinguish healthy people from people with brain diseases or disorders, and provide insight into variations in cognitive ability and personality traits.

The findings are published April 18 in Neuron.

""This is a step toward realizing the clinical promise of functional connectivity MRI,"" said senior author Steven Petersen, PhD, the James S. McDonnell Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience in Neurology and a professor of neurosurgery, of biomedical engineering, of psychological and brain sciences, and of radiology. ""Before we can develop diagnostic tests based on fcMRI, we need to know what it is actually measuring. We show here that it's not measuring what you're thinking, but how your brain is organized. That opens the door to an entire new field of clinical testing.""

Petersen, postdoctoral researcher and first author Caterina Gratton, PhD, and colleagues analyzed a set of data collected by the Midnight Scan Club, a group of Washington University scientists who took turns undergoing myriad scans in an MRI machine late at night, when the demand for such machines and, consequently, the usage fees tend to be low.

The researchers analyzed data from more than 10 hours of fcMRI scans on each of nine people, collected in 10 separate one-hour sessions for each person. During the scans, each person performed tasks related to vision, memory, reading or motor skills, or rested quietly.

Functional MRI scans generate a dynamic map of the outer surface of the brain, showing changing hot spots of activity over time. To create a functional connectivity map, Gratton divided the brain's surface into 333 regions and identified areas that became active and inactive in unison. She then constructed brain network maps for each individual, showing patterns of correlation between parts of the brain.

The sheer quantity of data available on each person allowed her to analyze how much an individual's brain networks changed from day to day and with different mental tasks.

The answer? Not much.

""Brain networks captured by fcMRI are really about the individual,"" Gratton said. ""Whether someone's watching a movie or thinking about her breakfast or moving her hands makes only a small difference. You can still identify that individual by her brain networks with a glance.""

The consistency of the fcMRI scans makes them a promising diagnostic tool. Although the technique's potential to identify brain disorders and diseases was noted years ago, fcMRI-based diagnostic tests have yet to make their way into doctors' offices. Progress has been stymied by confusion over whether the scans reflect fundamental, stable features of the brain, or if they change with every passing thought.

Further, the researchers found that the technique was powerful enough to distinguish people who were extraordinarily alike. All of the scanned brains belonged to young, healthy scientists and doctors.

""We need more data before we can know what is normal variation in the population at large,"" Gratton said. ""But the individual differences were really easy to pick up, even in a population that is really very similar. It's exciting to think that these individual differences may be related to personality, cognitive ability, or psychiatric or neurological disease. Thanks to this work, we know we have a reliable tool to study these possibilities.""

"A study from Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, shines more light on the link between consumption of fish and better long-term neurological health

A new study from Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, shines more light on the link between consumption of fish and better long-term neurological health. Parvalbumin, a protein found in great quantities in several different fish species, has been shown to help prevent the formation of certain protein structures closely associated with Parkinson's disease.

Fish has long been considered a healthy food, linked to improved long-term cognitive health, but the reasons for this have been unclear. Omega-3 and -6, fatty acids commonly found in fish, are often assumed to be responsible, and are commonly marketed in this fashion. However, the scientific research regarding this topic has drawn mixed conclusions. Now, new research from Chalmers has shown that the protein parvalbumin, which is very common in many fish species, may be contributing to this effect.

One of the hallmarks of Parkinson's disease is amyloid formation of a particular human protein, called alpha-synuclein. Alpha-synuclein is even sometimes referred to as the 'Parkinson's protein'.

What the Chalmers researchers have now discovered, is that parvalbumin can form amyloid structures that bind together with the alpha-synuclein protein. Parvalbumin effectively 'scavenges' the alpha-synuclein proteins, using them for its own purposes, thus preventing them from forming their own potentially harmful amyloids later on.

""Parvalbumin collects up the 'Parkinson's protein' and actually prevents it from aggregating, simply by aggregating itself first,"" explains Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede, Professor and Head of the Chemical Biology division at Chalmers, and lead author on the study.

With the parvalbumin protein so highly abundant in certain fish species, increasing the amount of fish in our diet might be a simple way to fight off Parkinson's disease. Herring, cod, carp, and redfish, including sockeye salmon and red snapper, have particularly high levels of parvalbumin, but it is common in many other fish species too. The levels of parvalbumin can also vary greatly throughout the year.

""Fish is normally a lot more nutritious at the end of the summer, because of increased metabolic activity. Levels of parvalbumin are much higher in fish after they have had a lot of sun, so it could be worthwhile increasing consumption during autumn,"" says Nathalie Scheers, Assistant Professor in the Department of Biology and Biological Engineering, and researcher on the study. It was Nathalie who first had the inspiration to investigate parvalbumin more closely, after a previous study she did looking at biomarkers for fish consumption.

Other neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, ALS and Huntington's disease, are also caused by certain amyloid structures interfering in the brain. The team is therefore keen to research this topic further, to see if the discovery relating to Parkinson's disease could have implications for other neurodegenerative disorders as well. Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede stresses the importance of finding ways to combat these neurological conditions in the future:

""These diseases come with age, and people are living longer and longer. There's going to be an explosion of these diseases in the future - and the scary part is that we currently have no cures. So we need to follow up on anything that looks promising.""

A follow up study, looking at parvalbumin from another angle, is indeed planned for this autumn. Nathalie Scheers, together with Professor Ingrid Undeland, also of Chalmers, will investigate parvalbumin from herring, and its transport in human tissues.

""It will be very interesting to study how parvalbumin distributes within human tissues in more depth. There could be some really exciting results.""

More About: Fish and Better Neurological Health

The link between higher consumption of fish and better long-term health for the brain has been long established. There is correlation between certain diets and decreased rates of Parkinson's disease - as well as other neurodegenerative conditions.

""Among those who follow a Mediterranean diet, with more fish, one sees lower rates of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's,"" says Tony Werner, a PhD student in the Department of Biology and Biological Engineering, and lead researcher on the study. This has also been observed in Japan, where seafood forms a central part of the diet. The team is careful to note that no definite links can be established at this point, however.

More About: Amyloids and Aggregation

Proteins are long chains of amino acids that fold into specific structures to carry out their function. But sometimes, proteins can fold incorrectly, and get tangled up with other proteins, a process known as aggregation. As these misfolded proteins aggregate together, they create long fibrous structures known as amyloids. Amyloids are not necessarily a bad thing, but can be responsible for various diseases. Some of them can interfere with neurons in the brain, killing those cells, and causing a variety of neurodegenerative conditions.

More About: The Study

Nathalie Scheers had looked at parvalbumin before in another context.

""I was on a previous study where we looked at possible compliance markers for fish intake. Parvalbumin is a cause of fish allergies, so we knew that it passed over to the blood, and that this form of parvalbumin is specific for fish""

She joined forces with Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede, and together they took the idea forward.

""Because Nathalie had previously shown that parvalbumin passes into the body of the person eating fish, it made sense to study its interaction with human proteins. We already knew that they can meet in the gut, the blood, or the brain,"" explains Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede.

"PULLMAN, Wash. - Washington State University researchers have developed a low-cost, portable laboratory on a phone that works nearly as well as clinical laboratories to detect common viral and bacterial infections.

The work could lead to faster and lower-cost lab results for fast-moving viral and bacterial epidemics, especially in rural or lower-resource regions where laboratory equipment and medical personnel are sometimes not readily available.

Led by Lei Li, assistant professor in the School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, they have published their work in the journal, Clinica Chimica Acta. Collaboration with Ping Wang, associate professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine, enabled the design and implementation of the key clinical validation study.

Symptoms, judgment, waiting

In rural or underserved areas, doctors sometimes must rely on a patient's symptoms or use their own judgement in looking at test sample color results to determine whether a patient has an infection. As expected, this process is often inaccurate. If they send results off to a lab in a distant city, the doctors sometimes must wait for days -- by which time the infection may have become widespread. Most existing mobile health diagnostic devices, meanwhile, can only analyze one sample at a time.

Smartphone vs. lab tests

The WSU researchers found that their portable smartphone reader worked nearly as well as standard lab testing in detecting 12 common viral and bacterial infectious diseases, such as mumps, measles, herpes, and Lyme Disease. The researchers tested the device, which is about the size of a hand, with 771 patient samples at Hospital of University of Pennsylvania and found that it provided false positives only about one percent of the time (was 97. to 99.9 percent accurate).

The smartphone reader, which includes a portable device, takes a photo of 96 sample wells at once and uses a computer program to carefully analyze color to determine positive or negative results.

""This smartphone reader has the potential to improve access and speed up healthcare delivery,"" said Li. ""If we find out about infections, we can treat them more quickly, which makes a difference especially in low-resource, remote areas.""

Low-cost components

Buying the components themselves, the research team was able to build the device for about $50, but the manufacturing cost would probably be lower than that, he said. They have filed a patent and hope to move forward with clinical trials that could lead to commercialization.

"NEW YORK April 25, 2018 - A new method for early and accurate breast cancer screening has been developed by researchers at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and Soroka University Medical Center, using commercially available technology.

The researchers were able to isolate relevant data to more accurately identify breast cancer biomarkers using two different electronic nose gas sensors for breath, along with gas-chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to quantify substances found in urine.

In their study published in Computers in Biology and Medicine, researchers detected breast cancer with more than 95 percent average accuracy using an inexpensive commercial electronic nose (e-nose) that identifies unique breath patterns in women with breast cancer. In addition, their revamped statistical analyses of urine samples submitted both by healthy patients and those diagnosed with breast cancer yielded 85 percent average accuracy.

""Breast cancer survival is strongly tied to the sensitivity of tumor detection; accurate methods for detecting smaller, earlier tumors remains a priority,"" says Prof. Yehuda Zeiri, a member of Ben-Gurion University's Department of Biomedical Engineering. ""Our new approach utilizing urine and exhaled breath samples, analyzed with inexpensive, commercially available processes, is non-invasive, accessible and may be easily implemented in a variety of settings.""

The study reports breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among females and the leading cause of death around the world. In 2016, breast cancer accounted for 29 percent of all new cancers identified in the United States and was responsible for 14 percent of all cancer-related deaths.

Mammography screenings, which are proven to significantly reduce breast cancer mortality, are not always able to detect small tumors in dense breast tissue. In fact, typical mammography sensitivity, which is 75 to 85 percent accurate, decreases to 30 to 50 percent in dense tissue.

Current diagnostic imaging detection for smaller tumors has significant drawbacks: dual-energy digital mammography, while effective, increases radiation exposure, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is expensive. Biopsies and serum biomarker identification processes are invasive, equipment-intensive and require significant expertise.

""We've now shown that inexpensive, commercial electronic noses are sufficient for classifying cancer patients at early stages,"" says Prof. Zeiri. ""With further study, it may also be possible to analyze exhaled breath and urine samples to identify other cancer types, as well.""

"It may seem strange to fight bacteria with more bacteria, but it could lead to a long-term solution for eczema patients

Eczema is the most common skin disease worldwide. People suffering from it often deal with a lifetime of painful symptoms. A new clinical trial is testing a natural treatment that researchers hope will provide a long-term solution for those dealing with the dry, itchy and painful skin that comes with chronic eczema. The trial uses a cream containing beneficial bacteria to fight harmful bacteria on the skin. While it may seem counterintuitive to treat bacteria with more bacteria, experts say this approach seeks to restore the natural microbial balance of healthy skin.

""There are over 1,000 species of bacteria that all live in balance on healthy skin, some that even produce natural antibiotics. However, we know that eczema patients lack the beneficial bacteria needed to kill Staph aureus, harmful bacteria that can worsen eczema,"" said Donald Leung, MD, head of the Division of Pediatric Allergy & Immunology at National Jewish Health.

To fight harmful bacteria, researchers isolate beneficial bacteria from our skin and grow it in a lab. It is then applied to eczema patients' skin as a lotion twice a day for a week. Bacterial DNA from patients' skin is then analyzed in a lab to determine if the cream effectively reduced the amount of bad bacteria present.

""Ideally, we want to eliminate all staph aureus from the skin of eczema patients,"" said Leung. ""What the cream does is help the skin gain back its natural balance and create that barrier needed to keep it healthy.""

Researchers hope that using the bacteria-infused cream will offer a long-term solution where other treatments fall short. Powerful antibiotics are commonly prescribed for eczema, but they kill good bacteria on patients' skin along with the bad. Creams containing corticosteroids are also often prescribed to eczema patients, but they come with harsh side effects, and patients usually can't tolerate them for long periods of time.

""The worst symptom of eczema is the itching and the scratching, and the more you scratch, the more it spreads. It can be very painful,"" said Cassandra Rodriguez, 33, who has struggled with eczema all her life.

Cassandra has tried just about every cream and medication on the market, and says when she learned about the clinical trial, she was on board to give it a try.

""The trial coordinator explained that it's like a probiotic for your skin,"" said Rodriguez. ""You hear all these things about good bacteria for your gut, so it seemed like a promising idea to apply that same concept to the skin.""

Cassandra's son also has eczema, and she's hoping this research will lead to an effective treatment so that he won't have to suffer with the pain and embarrassment of the disease for as long as she has. ""He's little now, but dealing with eczema as a teen and an adult is really difficult,"" said Rodriguez. ""If there were something on the market that could help him and help everyone suffering with eczema every day, that would be amazing.""

Experts say there is more research to be done, but that the goal of the trial is to discover the best combination of bacteria to clear eczema from the skin and then make it available to patients as a prescription cream. The next steps involve testing those different combinations, ensuring they're safe and conducting a longer trial to see if the benefits of bacterial cream can truly provide a permanent solution for eczema patients.

"How to treat patients who have microinvasive breast cancer - tumors that are 1 mm or less in size (the thickness of a dime) -- is somewhat controversial. Can these tiny tumors affect the lymph nodes and spread cancer to other areas of the body?

Physicians at the Virginia Piper Cancer Institute wanted to know if surgical procedures to test the lymph nodes for cancer were always necessary.

They examined the outcomes of 294 patients who were treated between 2001 and 2015. Only 1.5 percent had positive lymph nodes - indicating the rare possibility of metastatic cancer. And the only patients with positive lymph nodes had microinvasive tumors that were associated with relatively large non-invasive tumors (ductal carcinoma in situ or DCIS).

""These findings allow surgeons to select which patients with microinvasive tumors may actually benefit from lymph node sampling, while sparing other patients from this procedure,"" said Tamera Lillemoe, M.D, pathologist and a study co-author.

"Can acupressure achieve a sustained reduction in menstrual pain? Is an app-based self-care program particularly attractive to young women? These questions addressed in a new study by researchers from Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, the results of which have been published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology*.

Approximately 50 to 90 percent of young women experience pain during their periods. While this pain primarily manifests itself as lower abdominal cramping, other symptoms include headache, backache, nausea and diarrhea. Acupressure is a technique derived from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). In contrast to acupuncture, this technique can be used as a form of self-care and is suitable for use at home. Rather than using needles, this technique involves massage or pressure being applied to specific points on the body.

The researchers wanted to evaluate whether in a group of women suffering from severe menstrual pain, aged between 18 and 34, self-acupressure would be more effective at achieving a sustained reduction in menstrual pain than usual care alone (e.g. pain medication and hormonal contraceptives). A total of 221 participants were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups, both of which received a study app and short introduction. Acupressure-based features - with instructions on how to administer self-acupressure shortly before and during menstruation - were only made available to the intervention group. One advantage of an app-based intervention is its ability to provide visual descriptions of the pressure points users need to target in order to achieve the desired effect. It can also send regular reminders. Additionally, the app was used to collect all study-related data.

""Initially, we simply wanted to conduct a study on the use of self-care techniques for menstrual pain. However, the women who were involved during the planning stages, all of whom were affected by menstrual pain, wanted an app,"" reports the study's principal investigator, Prof. Dr. Claudia Witt of the Institute of Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Health Economics. The app helped participants to apply simple self-acupressure techniques to three different acupressure points.

After three months, 37 percent of participants in the acupressure group reported a 50 percent reduction in pain intensity. After six months, this proportion had increased to more than half of the women in this group (58 percent). Only 25 percent of women in the control group reported a similar reduction in pain intensity at both the 3-month and 6-month marks. Women in the acupressure group also used less pain medication than women in the control group and reported lower levels of pain overall.

""We were surprised to see that, after six months, two thirds of participants continued to use self-acupressure. So far, research into the clinical effectiveness of apps has been limited, and only a few have been tested using randomized controlled trials,"" says Dr. Daniel Pach of the Institute of Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Health Economics. He adds: ""We were able to show that apps can be evaluated in a clinical trial setting. However, despite our experience with conventional clinical trials, there was a lot for us to learn - something we found both exciting and eye-opening."" The app Luna has recently been updated and optimized for use with iOS.

"Less invasive procedure, often for osteoarthritis, used in only 9% of cases, researchers find

Many more people facing surgery for knee problems would be better off with a partial rather than total knee replacement, which should allow them to recover faster, say experts.



Partial replacements are also cheaper, say researchers from Oxford University. The NHS, however, needs to get the support of surgeons, many of whom rarely carry out the less invasive procedure.

Knees, stretching and heel-striking: three running myths debunked Read more

Partial replacements, also known as unicompartmental replacements, are suitable for people who have arthritis in just one side of the knee, usually the inner. They can be carried out with a smaller incision using minimally invasive surgery, but they are only suitable for people whose ligaments inside the knee are strong.



Researchers from the Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences (NDORMS) publishing in the BMJ Open journal found that the less invasive procedure was being used less than it could be.

The main reason for the surgery is osteoarthritis. About half of all patients should be suitable for a partial replacement, but an analysis of data routinely collected by the National Joint Registry showed that of 98,147 knee replacements undertaken in 2016, only 9% were partial.

“The main strength of this study is that we were able to use real data, from very large numbers of people, about their actual operations, their GP visit, and their own reported quality of life outcomes in a way that is not always possible,” said Dr Rafael Pinedo-Villanueva, the co-lead researcher and NDORMS senior health economist, who is funded by the National Institute of Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre and the Medical Research Council.

“This has allowed us to provide strong proof that partial knee replacements are both better for patients and cheaper for the NHS.”

Whether people had a partial or total replacement varied by surgeon, as did the success of the operation, the researchers discovered. Those surgeons who carried out more partial replacements had better outcomes from them than surgeons who did fewer.

“This is an important finding,” said co-lead researcher Prof David Murray. “If surgeons aim to use partial knees in a quarter or more of their knee replacements this will substantially improve the results of knee replacement and will save money. In addition, more partial knee replacements will be done and more patients will benefit from this procedure.”

Ed Burn, first author of the paper, said they needed to get surgeons on board. “For patients and the NHS to see the benefits of partial replacements, we need the buy-in of surgeons, who would need to feel comfortable performing a greater proportion of their knee replacements as partials,” he said.

“If we see surgeons carrying out this procedure more often, the proportion of knee replacements that are partials would increase from the current figure of 9% and we would see an increase in future economic and population health gains.”"	Partial rather than full knee replacements better for many – report	2018-04-30 06:00:00	https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/30/partial-knee-replacements-osteoarthritis	story_reviews_00077	fake
"The drug floods the brain with hormones and neurotransmitters that evoke feelings of trust and well-being, users report. Researchers say this allows patients to re-examine traumatic memories.

In follow-up psychotherapy, patients process emotions and insights brought up during the MDMA session. The current protocol calls for patients to take MDMA two or three times, each a month apart, interspersed with psychotherapy.

“The MDMA alone or the therapy alone don’t appear to be as effective,” Dr. Mithoefer said. “The MDMA seems to act as a catalyst that allows the healing to happen.”

What do patients say about it?

“I was actually able to forgive myself,” said Nigel McCourry, 36 a Marine veteran who was deployed in 2004 to Falluja, Iraq, whose experiences mirrored those of three other patients interviewed.

Mr. McCourry came home from war unable to escape scenes of an explosion that nearly killed him, and haunted by the memory of two young girls he accidentally killed in a fire fight. He struggled to sleep. He drank to forget. Rage eroded most of his relationships.

He tried help at a Veterans Affairs hospital, but couldn’t let his guard down enough to benefit from standard psychotherapy. A handful of medications meant to help left him feeling like a zombie, and he gave them up. He was contemplating suicide when he tried MDMA.

“When it kicked in, it was like an epiphany,” he said. “I could see all these things from combat I was afraid to look at before, and I had a totally new perspective. I relived the parts of me I had lost. I realized I had viewed myself as a monster, and I was able to start to have some compassion for myself. It was a turning point, and for the next year I continued to get better.”"	Ecstasy as a Remedy for PTSD?

HealthDay Reporter

THURSDAY, May 3, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Much of the debate over when to start having mammograms has focused on lives saved, but new research suggests that early screening might also translate into smaller tumors and less aggressive breast cancer treatments.

""There are multiple benefits of mammography in terms of early detection. Not only do we save lives, but we reduce the likelihood of needing more aggressive treatment,"" said study author Dr. Elisa Port. She directs the Dubin Breast Center at Mount Sinai and is chief of breast surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital, both in New York City.

Currently, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that biennial screenings start at age 50 for most women, while the American Cancer Society advises that annual screenings begin at age 45. Earlier guidelines had suggested annual screenings begin at age 40.

Port noted that screening guidelines tend to be based on the ability of mammograms to save lives and how often they give a false positive result.

""But isn't there some benefit to getting tested earlier, like needing fewer lymph nodes removed and not needing chemotherapy? I think it's safe to say that most women, if they could be assured the same survival, would choose not to get more aggressive therapies,"" she said.

Port's study included more than 1,100 women diagnosed with breast cancer at the Dubin Breast Center. All of the women were older than 40.

The women were separated into two groups. One group had a mammogram within the 24 months before their breast cancer diagnosis. The other group had a screening 25 months or more before their diagnosis. The second group also included women who had never had a mammogram.

Women in the second group were 50 percent more likely to need chemotherapy. They were also 32 percent more likely to need surgery to remove the whole breast (mastectomy), and 66 percent more likely to need lymph nodes removed. And the women who were screened earlier had smaller tumors.

Port also looked at the 40- to 49-year-old age group, and found those who had never had a mammogram were much more likely to need chemotherapy. They were also more likely to have larger tumors (by 10 millimeters, on average) and to need a mastectomy than those in the 24 months or less group. But only 29 women fell into the ""never had a mammogram"" group.

However, the study did not prove a cause-and-effect link between earlier mammograms and smaller tumors and less aggressive treatment.

And Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, noted that this was an observational study that only looked at the experience of one institution.

Still, ""the observations are consistent with what we have seen with the value of early detection. Clearly, the earlier a breast cancer is diagnosed, the less treatment that will be required. But this study doesn't tell us about long-term outcomes or what transpired over a long period of time,"" he said.

Also, because of the nature of the study and the small sample size in the young age group sub-analysis, Lichtenfeld said that ""this cannot be interpreted as a study telling us what age to start mammograms.""

The study is to be presented Thursday at the American Society of Breast Surgeons meeting, in Orlando, Fla. Findings presented at meetings are typically viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

"TITUSVILLE, N.J., May 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson today announced the results from two Phase 3 clinical studies of the investigational compound esketamine nasal spray in patients with treatment-resistant depression. These studies will be presented at the American Psychiatric Association Annual Meeting, taking place May 5-9 in New York, NY.

Data from a study in adults with treatment-resistant depression showed that flexibly dosed esketamine nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant demonstrated a statistically significant, clinically meaningful rapid reduction of depressive symptoms as compared to placebo nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant. The study defined treatment-resistant as patients who had not responded to two or more currently available antidepressants of adequate dose and duration in the current episode of depression.

Data from a second study, in elderly patients aged 65 and older with treatment-resistant depression, which is the first study of its kind, showed treatment with flexibly dosed esketamine plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant demonstrated clinically meaningful effects compared to placebo nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant. However, the study narrowly missed statistical significance for its primary efficacy endpoint.

If approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), esketamine would be one of the first new approaches to treat refractory major depressive disorder available to patients in the last 50 years.

""With about 30 percent of patients with major depression failing to respond to currently available antidepressants1, treatment-resistant depression represents a major public health need,"" said Husseini K. Manji, MD, Global Head, Neuroscience Therapeutic Area, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. ""The positive Phase 3 results for esketamine nasal spray in adults with treatment-resistant depression are exciting, particularly as they mark the first time an antidepressant has achieved superiority versus an active comparator in any clinical trial for major depressive disorder. What makes this even more significant is that the response was rapid and this milestone was achieved in patients deemed to be treatment-resistant. We are also pleased with the clinically meaningful outcomes for esketamine nasal spray in elderly patients, a population that often has greater disability and lower response rates.""

""There's a critical need for new, rapidly acting and effective treatment options for people with major depressive disorder who do not respond to existing therapies,"" said Mathai Mammen, M.D., Ph.D., Global Head, Janssen Research & Development, LLC. ""Janssen is fully committed to exploring the newest science in the area of mood disorders and bringing these discoveries to patients in need.""

Results of the Study in Adults with Treatment-Resistant Depression

In the Phase 3 study of adults with treatment-resistant depression, patients were randomized to flexibly dosed esketamine nasal spray (56 mg or 84 mg) added to a newly initiated oral antidepressant or placebo nasal spray added to a newly initiated oral antidepressant.

Primary Efficacy Endpoint

The primary efficacy endpoint, change from baseline in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score, demonstrated the statistically significant clinical improvement in patients' depressive symptoms for esketamine nasal spray plus an oral antidepressant at day 28 (Least Squares Mean Difference Standard Error from placebo nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant: -4.0 [1.69], 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: -7.31, -0.64; one-sided p=0.010).

Secondary and Other Efficacy Endpoints

The first key secondary endpoint (onset of clinical response by 24 hours post-dose that is maintained through day 28) numerically favored esketamine nasal spray plus an oral antidepressant vs. placebo nasal spray plus an oral antidepressant, but did not meet statistical significance (1-sided p=0.161). The other two key secondary endpoints (Sheehan Disability Scale [SDS], a subject-reported outcome measure widely used and accepted for assessment of functional impairment and associated disability, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9], a self-report scale assessing depressive symptoms) could not be formally evaluated since onset of clinical response was not statistically significant. Among other endpoints, response rate was notable with 69.3% responding in the esketamine group vs. 52% in the placebo group at 28 days (response ≥ 50% improvement in MADRS from baseline). Remission rate (MADRS total score ≤12) at day 28 was 52.5% and 31.0% for the esketamine and placebo groups, respectively.

The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (>10%) reported in the esketamine group were metallic taste, nausea, vertigo, dizziness, headache, drowsiness, dissociation, blurred vision, paraesthesia (tingling sensation) and anxiety. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (>10%) reported in the placebo group were metallic taste and headache.

Results of the Study in Elderly Patients with Treatment-Resistant Depression

Janssen conducted a separate Phase 3 study in elderly patients with treatment-resistant depression. Elderly populations with major depressive disorder are historically hard to treat and often have co-morbidities and long-standing depression. To improve tolerability, patients were given a lower starting dose (28 mg) of esketamine nasal spray (flexibly dosed at 28 mg, 56 mg or 84 mg) plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant or placebo nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant.

Primary Efficacy Endpoint

Although statistical significance for the primary endpoint for the overall patient population studied was narrowly missed, results favored the esketamine nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant group (median unbiased estimate of the difference from placebo nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant: -3.6, 95% CI: -7.20, 0.07; one-sided p=0.029). To put this into context, an analysis of placebo-controlled data from three prior studies conducted by Duru and Fantino determined that a minimum change in MADRS of 1.9 was clinically meaningful.2 In addition, the average difference is between 2-3 points for currently approved antidepressants vs. placebo.3

Safety results were consistent with previous studies of esketamine in younger adult populations. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (>10%) reported in the esketamine group were dizziness, nausea, headache, fatigue, increased blood pressure, vertigo and dissociation. There were no treatment-emergent adverse events reported in >10% of patients in the placebo group.

Esketamine nasal spray has an acceptable safety and tolerability profile, based on the adverse event data from both Phase 3 studies. Adverse events and associated symptoms were seen predominately on the day of dosing and were generally transient and resolved on the day of dosing.

These findings represent two of the five Phase 3 studies that comprise Janssen's treatment-resistant depression program with esketamine nasal spray. The results from these studies will inform regulatory filings for esketamine nasal spray in treatment-resistant depression, for which Janssen has received Breakthrough Therapy Designations from the U.S. FDA. Data from other Phase 3 studies will be presented later in 2018.

About the Studies

In both Phase 3 studies, esketamine or placebo was provided in disposable nasal spray devices containing 200 μl of solution (i.e., two sprays), and administered under the supervision of a health care professional. A bittering agent was added to placebo to simulate the taste of esketamine, to help mask the treatment assignment.

The study in adults with treatment-resistant depression was a Phase 3, double-blind, active-control, flexibly dosed, multi-center study using blinded raters, conducted at 39 sites in Czech Republic, Germany, Poland, Spain and the United States from August 2015 to November 2017. The study enrolled adults with moderate-to-severe, non-psychotic, recurrent or persistent depression, and history of non-response to ≥2 antidepressants in the current episode of depression, with one of them assessed prospectively. Non-responders were randomized (1:1) to flexibly-dosed esketamine nasal spray (56 or 84 mg twice weekly) plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant (N=114) or placebo nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant (N=109). The primary efficacy endpoint – change from baseline to day 28 in MADRS total score – was assessed among patients who received ≥1 dose of (nasal spray and oral) study medication by mixed-effects model using repeated measures using a one-sided significance level of 0.025. (5.69). For further information about this study, visit the ClinicalTrials.gov website.

The study in elderly patients with treatment-resistant depression was a Phase 3, double-blind, multicenter, active-controlled study. Patients ≥ 65 years of age were randomized 1:1 to either esketamine nasal spray plus a new oral antidepressant (N=72) or placebo nasal spray plus a new oral antidepressant (N=66). The primary endpoint was the change in the MADRS total score from day 1 (baseline) to day 28. Statistical analysis employed mixed-effects model repeated measures (MMRM), with a weighted combination test to account for an interim analysis for sample size re-estimation, using a one-sided significance level of 0.025. For further information about this study, visit the ClinicalTrials.gov website.

About Esketamine

Esketamine nasal spray is an investigational compound being studied by Janssen Research & Development, LLC as part of a global development program. Esketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, also known as a glutamate receptor modulator, thought to help restore synaptic connections in brain cells in people with major depressive disorder. It has a novel mechanism of action, meaning it works differently than currently available therapies for depression.

Esketamine received Breakthrough Therapy Designations from the U.S. FDA in November 2013 for treatment-resistant depression and in August 2016 for the indication of major depressive disorder with imminent risk for suicide.4

About Major Depressive Disorder

Major depressive disorder affects nearly 300 million people of all ages globally and is the leading cause of disability worldwide.5 Individuals with depression, including major depressive disorder, experience continuous suffering from a serious, biologically based disease which has a significant negative impact on all aspects of life, including quality of life and function.5 Although currently available antidepressants are effective for many patients, about one third of patients do not respond to treatment and are thought to have treatment-resistant depression.6

"	New Phase 3 Data Show Esketamine Nasal Spray Demonstrated Rapid Improvements in Depressive Symptoms in Patients with Treatment-Resistant Depression	2018-05-05 08:00:00-04:00	https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-phase-3-data-show-esketamine-nasal-spray-demonstrated-rapid-improvements-in-depressive-symptoms-in-patients-with-treatment-resistant-depression-300643208.html	news_reviews_00078	true
"Paxil or Prozac, Zoloft or Lexapro?

When treating a patient suffering from depression, Brent Forester considers which anti-depressant to prescribe—ideally, one that will ease psychic pain without side effects.

It can be a tough call.

Deciding “becomes somewhat of an art—and a lot of it is educated guesswork,” says Dr. Forester, chief of geriatric psychiatry at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., an affiliate of Harvard Medical School. He worries that sometimes psychiatrists “may think we are better than we really are” at making these choices.

That may change as Dr. Forester and others enlist genomics, a form of precision medicine and an intriguing new frontier for the elusive science of the human psyche. Other branches of medicine, such as oncology, have embraced gene-based testing to help determine which cancer patients need chemotherapy or surgery. But psychiatrists typically haven’t let genomics guide treatment decisions, Dr. Forester says.

One test, called GeneSight, uses a genetic analysis of DNA samples from a cheek swab to help doctors figure out which drugs are likely to combat a patient’s depression. The test examines a dozen genes to determine how well the patient will metabolize certain drugs and how his or her brain will respond to them.

The test predicts the effects of more than 50 anti-depressants and anti-psychotics. Based on a patient’s results, drugs are categorized as ones to be avoided, ones that have some drawbacks and ones that can be used “as directed.”

Barbara Dellovade, a retired real estate broker in Acton, Mass., became depressed last year. Ms. Dellovade, who is 78 years old, was taking an anti-depressant, but “I wasn’t reacting well to it and it wasn’t helping me at all.” She consulted Ipsit Vahia, a geriatric psychiatrist at McLean Hospital and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School.

More The Food That Helps Battle Depression

Dr. Vahia told Ms. Dellovade about the genomics test, which retails for $1,500 and is covered by Medicare and some health plans. After receiving an analysis of Ms. Dellovade’s results, he switched her to a different anti-depressant and she began to respond in about six weeks, he says. Ms. Dellovade has been feeling better, she says, though “I am still not there.”

Dr. Vahia has been using the gene test more with his older depressed patients but says clinical judgment remains paramount in prescribing. “The brain...is the most complex organ in the body,” he says. “This is a small step, but it is an important step. We are adding a degree of precision” to treating depression.

McLean Hospital is one of 60 sites across the country that took part in a randomized trial of GeneSight. The results, which will be unveiled this week at the American Psychiatric Association meeting, showed that patients fared better when physicians chose a medication with the help of the test, rather than relying solely on their judgment.

Among the 1,167 patients in the trial, half took the GeneSight test and half were prescribed drugs based purely on their doctors’ clinical assessments. Genetics helps you “marry” a patient with the appropriate medication, says Bryan Dechairo, executive vice president for clinical development at Myriad Genetics, which funded the trial. Assurex Health, a subsidiary of Myriad Genetics, developed the GeneSight test.

The results were striking, according to doctors at several medical centers who participated in the trial. Patients were more likely to respond to anti-depressants when the gene test was used to determine which drug they should be on; researchers found a 30% greater response to the medicine when the test was applied. Every patient in the trial had been on at least one anti-depressant that failed to work, and some had been on several that failed.

The study shows that genetic tests can lead to better prescribing decisions, says John Greden, the principal investigator in the trial. Dr. Greden, a psychiatrist and executive director of the University of Michigan’s Comprehensive Depression Center, says that until now, many doctors took the following approach: “My favorite anti-depressant is this one, so I will try it. Oh, that didn’t work, so I will try this one.”

Unfortunately, he says, under that hit-or-miss method—albeit informed by training and experience—“fewer than 40% of patients achieve remission.” Every year, 16 million Americans suffer an episode of depression, he says, making pinpointed diagnoses essential.

Some doctors took a while to come around to the GeneSight test. Charles DeBattista, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Stanford University School of Medicine, says initially he was “somewhat skeptical.”

“Prior to the study I used it very rarely,” says Dr. DeBattista, who specializes in patients with treatment-resistant depression. He has been using the test more on patients who “have had problems tolerating medicine in the past,” he says. “There is nothing magical about it; it is not a substitute for clinical judgment.” But it does inform him what drug to try on a patient with serious depression.

His Stanford colleague Alan Schatzberg isn’t persuaded. The test “has some value,” says Dr. Schatzberg, a psychiatrist and a former president of the American Psychiatric Association. “It has some use but what it doesn’t do is tell you which specific drug to use.” He adds, “What the field really wants is a test that tells me which specific drug I should put my patient on.”

That is precisely what Charles Conway, a professor of psychiatry at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, likes about it. The test “provides recommendations,” Dr. Conway says. “It doesn’t say: ‘Give this drug only.’ It says: ‘You have a range of choices, which you will [make] based on your clinical judgment.’ ”"	Which Anti-Depressant Is Right for You?

"ROSEMONT, Ill. (May 1, 2018)--An estimated 45 percent of people are at risk of developing knee osteoarthritis (OA) in their lifetime. According to a network meta-analysis research article published in the May 1, 2018 issue of the Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (JAAOS), the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) naproxen was ranked most effective in individual knee OA treatment for improving both pain and function, and is considered a relatively safe and low-cost treatment method.

Nonsurgical treatments for knee OA supported by previous research evidence include strength training, low-impact aerobic exercises, NSAIDs, and weight loss in individuals with a body mass index over 25. This new research analyzed data from multiple trials to determine the relative effectiveness of various nonsurgical treatments for knee OA. The treatments that were compared and ranked included acetaminophen; ibuprofen; intra-articular (IA) or joint injections of cortisone; platelet-rich plasma (PRP); hyaluronic acid (HA); several NSAIDs, such as naproxen, celecoxib, and diclofenac; and both oral and IA placebo.

""This is the first comprehensive mixed-comparison analysis comparing best-evidence scientific research and excluding lower quality studies that can bias the outcomes,"" said lead author and orthopaedic surgeon David Jevsevar, MD, MBA. ""Using a statistical ranking technique, we worked to provide evidence regarding which of the most common NSAIDs are most likely to decrease pain and improve function, and we attempted to fill in the gaps in evidence for more inconclusive treatments such as HA, PRP, and corticosteroids.""

Authors analyzed 53 randomized controlled trials that examined knee OA treatments for at least 28 days and included a minimum of 30 participants per study group. Knee OA treatments were ranked on a scale of one to five, with one being the most effective. They found the following:

For pain reduction, cortisone injections provided the greatest short-term (4 to 6 weeks) pain relief, followed by ibuprofen, PRP injections, naproxen, and celecoxib.

Naproxen ranked the highest for probability for improving function, followed by diclofenac, celecoxib, ibuprofen, and PRP injections.

Naproxen was ranked the most effective individual knee OA treatment for improving both pain and function followed by cortisone injections, PRP injections, ibuprofen and celecoxib.

HA injections did not achieve a rank in the top five treatments for pain, function, or combined pain and function. An analysis of 12 articles also found that results with HA are not significantly different from those with IA placebo for treatment of knee OA.

""Because knee OA has both a high disease burden and high treatment costs, additional prospective studies using similar outcomes, timelines, and measures of clinically important changes are needed,"" explained Dr. Jevsevar. ""While the information in this analysis is helpful to physicians, patients also can benefit from these findings and use it with their doctors to weigh all possible treatment options.""

Although the use of NSAIDs for arthritic conditions such as knee OA has potential risks, including heart attack and stroke, existing evidence indicates that naproxen has less potential for adverse cardiovascular events.

"Sylentis, Pharmaceutical Company belonging to the PharmaMar Group, has presented results from the clinical studies carried out with tivanisiran for the treatment of dry eye syndrome and that has enabled the start-up of the Phase III ""Helix"" clinical trial. The presentation has taken place within the framework of the annual meeting of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) that has been held from the 29th of April to the 3rd of May in Honolulu, Hawaii.

The purpose if this meeting is to share the latest breakthroughs in research in the area of ophthalmology, to contribute to the progress in basic science and also in cutting-edge clinical research. In this context, Sylentis has participated at this event presenting the pre-clinical and clinical results of various compounds that are being developed for the treatment of ocular disorders. Among these, the abstract ""Tivanisiran a new treatment for Dry Eye Disease, that improved signs and symptoms in clinical trials"" (Posterboard number: 925 - B0103) is highlighted, the compound improving the ocular inflammatory parameters, tear quality and a reduction in ocular pain associated with dry eye disease is also underlined1.

The novel mechanism of action of tivanisiran, based on genetic silencing through RNA interference (RNAi), is targeted at the treatment of the signs and symptoms of this pathology, making it a firm candidate for the treatment of dry eye disease.

According to Ana Isabel Jiménez, Director of R&D at Sylentis, ""we trust in our technology, innovative in this field, and we hope that tivanisiran will soon become a real alternative for the treatment of millions of people that suffer dry eye disease around the world.""

In this respect, Jiménez points out that ""this is a significant step forward in the development of innovative drugs in different therapeutic areas through a novel technology of genetic silencing based on the RNA.""

Sylentis is a pioneer in RNAi research, and is one of the few in Europe that applies this technology to the field of ophthalmology. It also continues with its research on new therapies for ophthalmological and inflammatory illnesses.

It must be empathized that this pathology affects more than 5 million in Spain, between 10% and 20% of the population, mostly women, and almost 100% of these being elderly , . In this context, the phase III ""Helix"" study is being carried out in more than 30 hospitals in Spain, Germany, Estonia, Portugal, Slovakia and Italy, in 300 patients to evaluate the efficacy of this compound in the treatment of the sign and symptoms of dry eye syndrome.

About tivanisiran (SYL1001)

Tivanisiran is a drug based on RNAi that is administered as preservative-free eye drops; it selectively inhibits production of the transient receptor potential cation channel (TRPV1). These receptors are ion channels that mediate the transmission of ocular pain. Tivanisiran is a small synthetic double-stranded RNA oligonucleotide (siRNA) with a novel and highly selective mechanism of action. Non-clinical studies conducted by Sylentis with SYL1001 have demonstrated it has high ability to inhibit this specific target and block the perception of ocular pain in animals3.

Tivanisiran is a product under development for the treatment of signs and symptoms related to dry eye syndrome and has the potential to be developed for other pathologies that cause ocular pain (corneal lesions, refractive surgery, etc.) , , .

About RNA interference (RNAi)

RNA interference (RNAi) is a natural cellular process that regulates the expression of certain genes, providing a role in innate defense and development in animals and plants. This process is used to specifically silence genetic transcripts that encode protein-causing diseases. The therapeutic application of targeted siRNAs is booming given the specificity of gene silencing for a particular protein in a given tissue and the lack of side effects. This new approach to drug discovery is a promising technology that is rapidly moving in the translational research space , .

About dry eye syndrome

Dry eye syndrome is a multifactorial disease of the tear film and ocular surface that produces symptoms of ocular discomfort, eyesight disorders, and tear film instability with potential damage to the ocular surface. Dry eye syndrome is accompanied by such symptoms as ocular pain, itching, stinging, and irritation of the eye tissues. It is a characteristic disease of developed countries, associated with pollution, air conditioning, the use of contact lenses, refractive surgery and continued use of computers. Moreover, the amount and quality of tears decrease with age. Prevalence is between 10% and 20% among people aged 50 or over, and it is more frequent in womeni,ii.

Dry eye can be treated with cyclosporin drops or autologous serum, but there is as yet no specific product for chronic treatment of the ocular pain related to dry eye syndrome; oral analgesics or anaesthetics are used in general. However, the main treatment consists of artificial tears, in the form of drops, gel or creams. Preservative-free eye drops have generally been found to offer the best long-term response.

"Updated | An existing drug used to treat a common bone disorder could hold the key to the cure for baldness, according to a new study.

Current treatments for hair loss are limited to two FDA-approved drugs, minoxidil and finasteride, which have mixed results. The other option is minimally invasive hair transplant surgery. In the U.S., there are around 50 million men and 30 million women affected by hair loss, which U.K.-based researchers said could be the source of “psychological distress.”

In a study conducted on human hair follicles, researchers investigated a drug called Cyclosporine A (CsA), which has been prescribed to treat immune disorders and transplant rejection since the 1980s. Side effects including shaking, headaches, vomiting and swollen gums—as well as unwanted hair growth.

REUTERS/Peter Macdiarmid

The research team, lead by Dr. Nathan Hawkshaw at the University of Manchester, investigated whether CsA could provide some clues for treating baldness.

After treating hair with CsA, the scientists analyzed the gene expressions of isolated human scalp hair follicles. They found that CsA changed how the follicles expressed a protein called SFRP1, which stunts the development and growth of hair follicles and other tissues in the body.

The scientists were then able to identify that WAY-316606, a compound used to treat osteoporosis, has a similar effect on how SFRP1 is expressed.

The compound WAY-316606 could therefore be used to treat baldness, without patients suffering the same side effects as they would on CsA. The study was published in the journal PLOS Biology.

Dr. Hawkshaw said in a statement: “The fact this new agent, which had never even been considered in a hair-loss context, promotes human hair growth is exciting because of its translational potential: it could one day make a real difference to people who suffer from hair loss.”

“Clearly though, a clinical trial is required next to tell us whether this drug or similar compounds are both effective and safe in hair-loss patients.”

A British Association of Dermatologists spokesperson said in a statement the results were interesting.

“For individuals with hair loss, treatments can be very hit and miss, there isn’t one which is universally effective. For that reason new treatments are exciting as they give people more treatment options that may be effective.

“This research has been tested on human tissue, which is promising, but not on humans themselves, so there is still some way to go.

“It is also important to realise that this is being proposed as a treatment for hair loss, not a cure as such.”

(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday expanded the use of Novartis AG’s relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) drug Gilenya to treat children and adolescents.

MS is a chronic, inflammatory, autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that disrupts communication between the brain and other parts of the body and is among the most common causes of neurological disability in young adults.

Gilenya is the first FDA-approved drug to treat pediatric patients suffering from relapsing MS, the U.S. health regulator said.

In a clinical trial 86 percent of patients receiving Gilenya remained relapse-free after 24 months of treatment, compared to 46 percent of those who were administered another MS drug.

"THURSDAY, May 24, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Because vertigo can have many causes, treating it can be difficult, but researchers have identified a new type that may be effectively treated with medication.

""These conditions can be difficult to diagnose and quite debilitating for people, so it's exciting to be able to discover this new diagnosis of a condition that may respond to treatment,"" said Dr. Ji-Soo Kim, a researcher at Seoul National University in South Korea.

Vertigo -- episodes of dizziness that can last for minutes or days -- may be triggered by a number of health issues, ranging from an inner ear disorder to tumors. In some cases, the cause is unclear. Patients can also experience other uncomfortable symptoms, including vomiting, headaches and motion sickness.

For the study, researchers recruited 338 people who had vertigo with an unknown cause. Some had attacks rarely, maybe once a year. Others had them two to three times a week. Participants also developed nausea, headaches and could not tolerate head movements during the attacks.

To diagnose the new vertigo, the researchers had patients sit in a dark room. They then moved each patient's head forward and shook it from side to side for about 15 seconds.

Afterwards, a video recorded the patients' eye movements. The researchers noticed that uncontrolled eye movements, called nystagmus, lasted longer in people with this new form of vertigo.

The findings were published online May 23 in Neurology.

""It's possible that the vertigo occurs when this unstable mechanism is disrupted by factors either within the person's body or in their environment,"" Kim said in a journal news release.

This new form of the condition is called recurrent spontaneous vertigo with head-shaking nystagmus. Thirty-five study participants had this form of vertigo.

They were compared to 35 others whose vertigo is triggered by other conditions, including the inner ear disorder Meniere's disease. Those with the newly identified form of vertigo experienced uncontrolled eye movements for 12 seconds -- twice as long as those with Meniere's and five seconds longer than those with vestibular migraine and another inner ear disorder called vestibular neuritis.

Those with the new form of vertigo were also more likely to have severe motion sickness than those with other forms of the condition, the study showed.

Preventative medication was given to 20 of the 35 people with the newly detected type of vertigo. Of these, one-third saw their symptoms reduced or they recovered completely.

The researchers followed the new vertigo patients for an average of 12 years. Five had no more attacks, 14 had an improvement in their condition, and only one person had a worsening of symptoms. The others' outcomes were not revealed.

"TITUSVILLE, N.J., May 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson today announced new real-world data that showed frail patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) experienced significantly fewer strokes and systemic emboli when treated with XARELTO® (rivaroxaban) over a two-year period compared to those taking warfarin. Specifically, long-term XARELTO® use reduced the risk of stroke and systemic embolism by 32 percent and ischemic stroke alone by 31 percent compared to warfarin, with no significant increase in major bleeding. Results from the study, which also assessed the efficacy and safety of apixaban and dabigatran each versus warfarin, were recently published in the Journal of the American Heart Association.

Click to Tweet: New two-year real-world data show Janssen blood thinner significantly reduced stroke in frail NVAF patients #JAHA #RWE #AFib https://ctt.ac/z3t2a+

Affecting nearly six million Americans, NVAF increases a person's risk of stroke by five times and accounts for 15 to 20 percent of all strokes.i,ii Frailty is a common clinical syndrome mainly seen in older adults that makes it harder for them to recover from stressful cardiovascular events and vulnerable for poorer health outcomes. People with NVAF are four times more likely to be classified as frail than people without NVAF,iii and research has shown frail people with NVAF are less likely to receive anticoagulation than non-frail people.iv,v,vi

""There is not widespread consensus on the best way to manage frail patients with NVAF in clinical practice, which is why some patients are not treated at all and remain at high risk of having a stroke,"" said Craig Coleman, PharmD, Professor of Pharmacy Practice, University of Connecticut. ""These results show long-term rivaroxaban use reduced stroke and systemic embolism in a vulnerable patient group, without increasing the risk of major bleeding. They also give physicians important insights into a well-tolerated, effective approach to treat their frail patients with NVAF.""

In the study, researchers used U.S. Truven MarketScan claims data and identified frail patients with NVAF taking XARELTO®, apixaban, or dabigatran. Each treatment group was matched separately with warfarin users in a 1:1 ratio and followed for up to two years or until an event, insurance disenrollment or end of follow-up occurred. The primary efficacy outcome was stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) or systemic embolism. Major bleeding was the primary safety outcome.

Researchers made the following two-year observations:

XARELTO ® was associated with a 32 percent reduction in stroke or systemic embolism (HR=0.68; 95% CI=0.49-0.95) and 31 percent reduction in ischemic stroke alone (HR=0.69; 95% CI=0.48-0.99) compared to warfarin.

was associated with a 32 percent reduction in stroke or systemic embolism (HR=0.68; 95% CI=0.49-0.95) and 31 percent reduction in ischemic stroke alone (HR=0.69; 95% CI=0.48-0.99) compared to warfarin. XARELTO ® had similar rates of major bleeding compared to warfarin (HR=1.07; 95% CI=0.81-1.32).

had similar rates of major bleeding compared to warfarin (HR=1.07; 95% CI=0.81-1.32). Though both apixaban and dabigatran treatment were associated with numerically fewer strokes, neither statistically significantly reduced the risk of stroke or systemic embolism at two years compared to warfarin (HR=0.78; 95% CI=0.46-1.35 and HR=0.94; 95% CI=0.60-1.45).

Rates of major bleeding were also evaluated for apixaban versus warfarin (HR=0.72; 95% CI=0.49-1.06) and dabigatran versus warfarin (HR=0.87; 95% CI=0.63-1.19).

""This study adds to the growing body of evidence supporting the positive efficacy and safety profile of XARELTO® across a broad spectrum of patients with NVAF, which now includes the frail population,"" said Paul Burton, MD, PhD, FACC, Vice President, Medical Affairs, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Real-world data like this study are critical to informing and helping physicians best treat their patients' cardiovascular diseases.""



About the Frailty Study

A total of 19,077 patients were identified using claims data from U.S. MarketScan databases from November 2011 to December 2016. These patients were new users of anticoagulant therapy with XARELTO®, apixaban, dabigatran, or warfarin, who had not been previously treated with an anticoagulant. They also had at least 12 months of continuous insurance coverage, and were considered frail. Frailty was determined using the Johns Hopkins Claims-based Frailty Indicator scoring algorithm, which weighs 21 criteria identifiable in claims data, including demographics, comorbidities, and physical and cognitive dysfunction.

Each eligible XARELTO®, apixaban, and dabigatran user was propensity score matched to a warfarin user in a 1:1 ratio, which helped minimize the presence of baseline differences between cohorts. A total of 10,754 patients were included in the retrospective study, with 2,635 taking XARELTO®, 1,392 apixaban, 1,350 dabigatran, and 5,377 warfarin. This study was supported by Bayer AG, Berlin, Germany.

Real-world data have the potential to supplement randomized controlled trial data by providing additional information about how a medicine performs in routine medical practice; however, they have limitations and cannot be used as stand-alone evidence to validate the efficacy and/or safety of a treatment.



Additionally, it is possible some of the analyses within this specific study may not have been sufficiently powered based on smaller sample sizes.

About Real-World XARELTO® Research

XARELTO® is the most-studied oral Factor Xa inhibitor in the world today. More than 200,000 people have been evaluated in published real-world research since the approval of XARELTO® across all approved indications in the U.S. Post-marketing studies and registries continue to confirm the safety and efficacy of XARELTO® in routine clinical use across a broad spectrum of patients. There have been no head-to-head randomized trials directly comparing non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants.

One recent study, REVISIT-US, found XARELTO® is providing an appropriate balance of benefit and risk with respect to ischemic stroke and found a significant reduction in intracranial hemorrhage in routine clinical practice. These are two of the most serious types of events physicians work the hardest with their patients to avoid, given their potential for irreversible harm.

WHAT IS XARELTO®?

XARELTO® (rivaroxaban) is a prescription medicine used to reduce the risk of stroke and blood clots in people with atrial fibrillation not caused by a heart valve problem. For patients currently well managed on warfarin, there is limited information on how XARELTO® and warfarin compare in reducing the risk of stroke.

XARELTO® is also a prescription medicine used to treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and to reduce the risk of blood clots happening again in people who continue to be at risk for DVT or PE after receiving treatment for blood clots for at least 6 months.

XARELTO® is also a prescription medicine used to reduce the risk of forming a blood clot in the legs and lungs of people who have just had knee or hip replacement surgery.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

What is the most important information I should know about XARELTO® (rivaroxaban)?

For people taking XARELTO® for atrial fibrillation:

People with atrial fibrillation (an irregular heart beat) are at an increased risk of forming a blood clot in the heart, which can travel to the brain, causing a stroke, or to other parts of the body. XARELTO® lowers your chance of having a stroke by helping to prevent clots from forming. If you stop taking XARELTO®, you may have increased risk of forming a clot in your blood.

Do not stop taking XARELTO® without talking to the doctor who prescribes it for you. Stopping XARELTO® increases your risk of having a stroke.

If you have to stop taking XARELTO®, your doctor may prescribe another blood thinner medicine to prevent a blood clot from forming.

XARELTO® can cause bleeding, which can be serious, and rarely may lead to death. This is because XARELTO® is a blood thinner medicine (anticoagulant) that reduces blood clotting. While you take XARELTO® you are likely to bruise more easily, and it may take longer for bleeding to stop.

You may have a higher risk of bleeding if you take XARELTO® and take other medicines that increase your risk of bleeding, including:

Aspirin or aspirin-containing products

"A surprising (but welcome) side effect of a therapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder may pave the way for a new approach to treating type 2 diabetes — and offer new insights into the links between obesity and the metabolic disease that afflicts close to 1 in 10 American adults.

The therapy in question is deep brain stimulation of the nucleus accumbens, a structure best known for its role in motivation, reward and addiction. It now appears that deep brain stimulation also increases the liver’s and muscles’ ability to take up and use insulin, researchers reported this week.

That’s important because the ability to use insulin effectively is compromised in most people with obesity and seriously impaired in those with type 2 diabetes.

This curious side effect of deep brain stimulation became clear after an obese man with diabetes who had suffered the repetitive thoughts and behaviors of OCD was treated for the psychiatric condition with a device that delivers electrical impulses into the brain.

Advertisement

Once the device was implanted and turned on, it prompted the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine throughout the ventral striatum, in which the nucleus accumbens sits. In short order, the patient noticed that his blood sugar control improved, and his daily need for insulin injections decreased by roughly 80%.

The new study appeared this week in the journal Science Translational Medicine.

The research is likely to generate renewed interest in understanding the addictive powers of food for some people and whether the brain processes behind that addiction also make people with obesity more vulnerable to diabetes, depression, heart disease and even some cancers.

“The connection between brain and metabolism is only partially understood,” said Dr. Miguel Alonso-Alonso, who directs Harvard University’s Mind Brain Behavior Interfaculty Initiative. Most research to date has focused on the hormonal influence of the hypothalamus, a structure adjoining the ventral striatum, on basic bodily functions, he added.

“This is a new and exciting direction with the involvement of the striatum, a key reward center,” Alonso-Alonso said. At the same time, he cautioned that “we first need to establish the nature of this association, understand its magnitude and its clinical relevance” before these early findings could be considered the basis for treatment.

That a single patient’s metabolic function improved after he got a pacemaker in the brain might have met with a shrug anywhere else. But to the Dutch authors of the new research, it was a clue that warranted further investigation.

To explore the brain’s role in metabolism more rigorously, the researchers, led by Kasper W. ter Horst of the University of Amsterdam’s Academic Medical Center, recruited 14 patients who also had had a brain stimulator implanted at the edge of the nucleus accumbens as treatment for OCD.

None of the 14 subjects recruited had type 2 diabetes. But even healthy people vary daily and hourly in the ability of fat, liver and muscles to take up insulin from the bloodstream and use it to convert food to energy.

This measure of metabolic health is called “insulin sensitivity,” and it is one of many metabolic functions that goes awry in people with obesity. In those who develop type 2 diabetes, sensitivity to insulin becomes so impaired that the body is tricked into believing less insulin is needed, and it pares back its production. The insulin-producing cells in the pancreas will often atrophy and die in response. As a person’s insulin production declines, an external supply of insulin is needed to control blood sugar and deliver fuel to muscles and organs.

As the researchers turned the 12 subjects’ brain stimulators on and off, they could see the subjects’ insulin sensitivity rise and fall. Metabolic function was better when their brain stimulators were turned on than when the devices were silenced.

The Dutch team ruled out that the performance improvement came from changes in other hormones that can affect metabolism, such as cortisol, epinephrine and norepinephrine. The action of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens appeared to be effecting the changes.

The researchers also gleaned a potentially important insight about how obesity may lead to worsening metabolic function: The effect of the deep brain stimulation appeared to be greater in the seven research subjects who were lean than it was in the seven who were either overweight or obese. Since long-term obesity is linked to changes in the striatal dopamine system, the differing responses of lean and overweight subjects suggest that those changes may start the ball rolling toward development of type 2 diabetes..

In a further experimental group of 10 healthy humans, the researchers found that using drugs to reduce dopamine levels across the body generated the opposite response, decreasing insulin sensitivity.

In mice, too, the researchers explored the role of the dopamine-fueled neurons of the nucleus accumbens. Using a technique called optogenetics, they bred mice with certain brain cells that could be activated when light of a particular frequency is shined on them.

Light stimulation of the dopamine-expressing neurons in the brains of mice “was sufficient to improve glucose tolerance” and improve insulin sensitivity, the authors reported. That suggests “a key role for striatal neuronal activity in the central regulation of metabolism,” they added.

The emerging data “suggest that the brain may play a much more active and complex role in the regulation of metabolism than we usually believe,” said Alonso-Alonso, who has explored the brain’s role in metabolism by using a less invasive means of activation called transcranial magnetic stimulation.

“This makes sense, because at the end, metabolic needs should align well with the overall state of the individual,” he said. It stands to reason that there’s cross-talk among key physiological functions; an individual’s cognitive, mental and social states; and situational circumstances, he added.

“I think there are real good opportunities here for this integrative research; we need to learn more about this connection,” Alonso-Alonso said.

"A portable device common in optometrists' offices may hold the key to faster diagnosis of schizophrenia, predicting relapse and symptom severity and assessing treatment effectiveness, a Rutgers University study finds.

In the study, published in the May 2018 issue of the Journal of Abnormal Psychology, researchers used RETeval, a hand-held device developed to record electrical activity from the retina, to replicate and extend prior studies showing that people with schizophrenia had abnormal electrical activity in the retina. This was the first time a portable device was used for these tests. The results show the device accurately indicated reduced electrical activity in the retina in multiple cell layers in the participants who had schizophrenia, including in cell types that had not been studied before in this disorder.

""Schizophrenia is a devastating disorder, probably the most disabling disorder long term. Although we know quite a bit about it, it's still not that well understood,"" said Steven Silverstein, professor of psychiatry at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and director of research at Rutgers University Behavioral Health Care (UBHC), who designed the study. ""Our study should help generate further research into developing a test that clinicians - like psychologists, psychiatrists or nurses - can use in their offices to diagnose, treat and monitor the condition of people with schizophrenia.""

Looking at biomarkers in the eye as a way to understand psychiatric disorders is a new field of study.

""Since the retina is part of the nervous system, what is happening in the retina is likely reflective of what is occurring in the brain,"" Silverstein said. ""For example, we know that certain changes in the retina, like thinning tissue [due to cell loss] or weakening electrical activity, occur alongside loss of brain tissue and reduced brain activity in patients with neurological disorders like multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. We and other researchers are now investigating whether retinal changes are related to brain structure and function changes in schizophrenia.""

In the just-published study, the researchers evaluated 50 participants: 25 with schizophrenia and 25 with no diagnosed psychiatric disorder. In the test, the participants closed one eye and placed the other against the RETeval device, which flashed 10 to 20 white or colored lights of various intensity against a white or colored background. A tiny skin electrode was placed on the skin under the eye to record the retina's electrical activity. The participants were tested in normal light and after sitting in the dark for 10 minutes to assess activity in different types of retinal cells. Most individual tests were completed within two minutes.

""Since many of our participants were experiencing severe psychiatric symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, we wanted to use a test that was as noninvasive and quick as possible,"" Silverstein said.

""While the portable device clearly distinguished people with schizophrenia from those without a psychiatric diagnosis, it's too soon to call this a diagnostic tool,"" said lead author Docia Demmin, a graduate assistant in UBHC's Division of Schizophrenia Research and a doctoral student in Rutgers Department of Psychology. ""However, since every prior study has found that people with schizophrenia exhibit reduced retinal wave forms and slowed retinal responses, our research shows that we closing in on an accurate test that is faster, less invasive, inexpensive and more accessible to patients.""

"In a first-of-its-kind finding, a new stroke-healing gel helped regrow neurons and blood vessels in mice with stroke-damaged brains, UCLA researchers report in the May 21 issue of Nature Materials.

""We tested this in laboratory mice to determine if it would repair the brain in a model of stroke, and lead to recovery,"" said Dr. S. Thomas Carmichael, Professor and Chair of neurology at UCLA. ""This study indicated that new brain tissue can be regenerated in what was previously just an inactive brain scar after stroke.""

The results suggest that such an approach may someday be a new therapy for stroke in people, said Dr. Tatiana Segura, a former Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at UCLA who is now a professor at Duke University. Carmichael and Segura collaborated on the study.

The brain has a limited capacity for recovery after stroke and other diseases. Unlike some other organs in the body, such as the liver or skin, the brain does not regenerate new connections, blood vessels or new tissue structures. Tissue that dies in the brain from stroke is absorbed, leaving a cavity, devoid of blood vessels, neurons or axons, the thin nerve fibers that project from neurons.

To see if healthy tissue surrounding the cavity could be coaxed into healing the stroke injury, Segura engineered a gel to inject into the stroke cavity that thickens to mimic the properties of brain tissue, creating a scaffolding for new growth.

The gel is infused with molecules that stimulate blood vessel growth and suppress inflammation, since inflammation results in scars and impedes regrowth of functional tissue.

After 16 weeks, stroke cavities in mice contained regenerated brain tissue, including new neural networks - a result that had not been seen before. The mice with new neurons showed improved motor behavior, though the exact mechanism wasn't clear.

""The new axons could actually be working,"" said Segura. ""Or the new tissue could be improving the performance of the surrounding, unharmed brain tissue.""

The gel was eventually absorbed by the body, leaving behind only new tissue.

This research was designed to explore recovery in acute stroke, or the period immediately following stroke - in mice, that is five days; in humans, that is two months. Next, Carmichael and Segura are determining if brain tissue can be regenerated in mice long after the stroke injury. More than 6 million Americans are living with the long-term outcomes of stroke, known as chronic stroke.

"Results of a recent study to better understand modifiable factors such as physical activity that may affect a woman's ability to conceive a child suggest that walking may help women to improve their chances of becoming pregnant.

AMHERST, Mass. - Results of a recent study to better understand modifiable factors such as physical activity that may affect a woman's ability to conceive a child suggest that walking may help women to improve their chances of becoming pregnant.

The study was conducted by recent graduate Lindsey Russo and her advisor Brian Whitcomb, associate professor of biostatistics and epidemiology in the School of Public Health and Health Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Russo and Whitcomb's findings among healthy women ages 18 to 40 years old with a history of one or two pregnancy losses are based on their secondary analysis of the multi-site Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction (EAGeR) study. It is led by Enrique Schisterman of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Results are in the current online issue of Human Reproduction.

Russo says, ""One of our main findings is that there was no overall relationship between most types of physical activity and the likelihood of becoming pregnant for women who had already had one or two pregnancy losses, except for walking, which was associated with higher likelihood of becoming pregnant among women who were overweight or obese.""

Whitcomb, whose research on the determinants of fertility and pregnancy outcomes usually involves studying biomarkers at the molecular level, adds, ""Lifestyle is definitely relevant to these outcomes because it can have an effect at the molecular level. What we eat and what we do are potential factors we can change to shape our health. So this sort of research is important because it helps provide information on the things people can actually do something about.""

Further, he says, ""We were happy to be able to add scientific evidence to general recommendations about physical activity. This is especially true for the results about walking for even limited blocks of time. Walking has great potential as a lifestyle change because of its low cost and availability.""

For the 1,214 women in the study, the association of walking with the ability to become pregnant, known as fecundability, varied significantly by body mass index, the authors report. Among overweight/obese women, walking at least 10 minutes at a time was associated with improvement in fecundability. Further, in statistically adjusted models, women reporting more than four hours a week of vigorous activity had significantly higher pregnancy chances compared to no vigorous activity.

Moderate activity, sitting and other activity categories were not associated with fecundability overall or in BMI-stratified analyses, they add. Russo and Whitcomb say one finding that is still not clear is the different associations related to vigorous compared to moderate and low-intensity activities. Whitcomb says, ""We don't know what to make of the finding that high intensity physical activity may have different biological effects than walking, but our study doesn't offer enough detail to get at why vigorous activity would work differently than other levels.""

Among a number of cautions the researchers point to in this work is that physical activity is related to other behaviors and lifestyle factors, and women who are more physically active may be different from women who are less active in many ways. Russo says, ""We did our best to try to account for the differences and to address them statistically.""

The researchers also note that the overall generalizability of this work is limited because the study population may not be representative of the general population with regard to fecundability, and exercise habits may differ in women with prior miscarriage compared to those without.

Whitcomb says another way in which this study is distinct from other work in this area has to do with who was included in the study. The EAGeR trial focused on women with a history of one or two prior pregnancy losses. However, he adds, ""We were happy to be able to conduct research considering women having the most difficulty getting and staying pregnant, and to provide messages about common lifestyle factors they may be able to address.""

The researchers conclude that ""these findings provide positive evidence for the benefits of physical activity in women attempting pregnancy, especially for walking among those with higher BMI. Further study is necessary to clarify possible mechanisms through which walking and vigorous activity might affect time-to-pregnancy.""

"TORONTO, May 22, 2018 - A non-surgical procedure, called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), along with prescribed medication, is better than medication alone as initial treatment for people who have the most common form of heart disease, suggests an analysis of an international clinical trial co-led by St. Michael's Hospital.

Published today in the New England Journal of Medicine and simultaneously presented at EuroPCR 2018 in Paris, France, the five-year analysis of the FAME 2 trial shows that initial PCI along with medication was associated with a significant reduction in urgent hospital admissions and revascularizations to restore blood flow in the blood vessels of the heart and a likely reduction in heart attacks as compared to medication as the only treatment. The medication used in the FAME 2 trial consisted of a combination of aspirin, cholesterol-lowering and blood pressure-lowering drugs as required by current treatment guidelines.

PCI is a minimally-invasive procedure where modern stents - small tubular metal scaffolds coated with medication - are inserted into an artery using a small catheter to widen a narrowed blood vessel in the heart. PCI is commonly used to treat sudden blockages of a coronary artery that cause a heart attack. In situations where the heart's arteries narrow less suddenly and do not cause a heart attack but induce chest pain during exercise - a condition known as stable coronary artery disease - it has remained unclear whether PCI in addition to medication was better than medication alone in preventing future heart attacks.

""Currently, the standard practice in North America is to prescribe medication to patients with stable coronary artery disease and avoid PCI,"" said Dr. Peter Jüni, Director of the Applied Health Research Centre (AHRC) at the Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute of St. Michael's Hospital, who is a senior author on the study. ""Our results pose the question: Would a large portion of patients benefit from early PCI in addition to medication?""

""We used pressure measurements inside the heart arteries to find coronary arteries that should be widened,"" said Dr. Bernard De Bruyne, an interventional cardiologist at the Cardiovascular Center Aalst in Belgium and the Principal Investigator of the trial. ""With these measurements we were able to identify patients who would benefit from PCI in addition to medication.""

The World Health Organization reports that every year, 17.7 million people die from cardiovascular diseases, which is an estimated 31 per cent of all deaths worldwide. Coronary artery disease is the most common type of heart disease in North America and Europe, and is a serious health problem worldwide. It occurs when the coronary arteries become narrow and hardened due to the build-up of cholesterol rich plaques in the blood vessels. While the FAME 2 trial showed that PCI reduced urgent hospital admissions and revascularizations and likely reduced heart attacks, it did not provide evidence for a difference between PCI and medication alone in the prevention of deaths.

The trial was initially sponsored by St. Jude Medical, a global medical device company, until the three-year follow-up. The subsequent two years of follow-up have been academically driven, organized the by the academic steering committee of the study. Nineteen sites across Europe and North America participated in the five-year follow-up.

""Our trial over its entire follow-up shows us that the longer you observe these patients, the more pronounced the benefits of the initial PCI become,"" said Dr. Jüni, who is also a Canada Research Chair and a Professor of Medicine at the University of Toronto.

While Drs. Jüni and De Bruyne agree there is more research to be done using modern PCI technology, this five-year follow-up offers evidence that PCI has the potential to provide long-term benefits to patients with stable coronary artery disease.

ASCO Perspective

“This is one more example of how immunotherapy is making steady gains against a number of cancers. Immunotherapy has been shown to be effective in other types of lung cancer, and now we’re seeing encouraging improvements in advanced squamous lung cancer, which historically has been very difficult to treat,” said ASCO Expert David Graham, MD, FASCO.

CHICAGO – Initial findings from a randomized phase III clinical trial show that patients with advanced squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) benefit more from initial treatment with PD-L1 targeted immunotherapy atezolizumab (Tecentriq®) and chemotherapy than from chemotherapy alone -- 29% had a reduced risk of disease worsening or death compared with those who received chemotherapy alone. At 12 months, cancer had not worsened in twice as many patients who received atezolizumab plus chemotherapy compared to those who only received chemotherapy. This benefit was observed across all PD-L1 expressing sub-groups.

The findings will be featured in a press briefing today and presented at the 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting.

“Until now, there have been few treatment advances for squamous non-small-cell lung cancer. Our findings may provide a new potential treatment option for this type of cancer,” said lead study author Robert M. Jotte, MD, PhD, Medical Director and Co-Chair, USON Thoracic Committee, Rocky Mountain Cancer Centers in Denver, CO. “We used to think that chemotherapy just knocked down the patient’s immune system and that it would be irrational to combine it with immunotherapy, but growing research, including this study, shows that chemotherapy can help trigger the immune response to the tumor, helping the immunotherapy treatment work better.”

Squamous NSCLC, which accounts for 25-30% of NSCLCs, is very difficult to treat. Fewer than 15% of people with advanced squamous NSCLC survive a year after diagnosis, and less than 2% survive five years.

Recent studies have also found a benefit of combining immunotherapy with chemotherapy in non-squamous lung cancer. Given those findings, along with the results from this trial, a rapid change in clinical practice is expected, noted Dr. Jotte.

About the Study

The IMpower131 trial enrolled 1,021 patients with stage IV squamous NSCLC. Tumors were tested for PD-L1 expression, but patients were included in the trial regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression level. Patients with EGFR or ALK gene changes in the tumor received targeted treatments before starting therapy on this trial. The study participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups. Outcomes for only two of the groups, however, are being reported in this presentation:

Atezolizumab plus chemotherapy (carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel), 343 patients

Chemotherapy (carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel), 340 patients

Outcome data for the third treatment group, which received atezolizumab with a slightly different chemotherapy regimen (carboplatin and paclitaxel), are not yet available.

Key Findings

In this study, 29% of all patients, regardless of PD-L1 expression, had a reduced risk of disease worsening or death, compared with those who received chemotherapy alone. Importantly, there was a doubling of progression-free survival (PFS) benefit with this combination: at 12 months, cancer had not worsened in 24.7% patients receiving immunotherapy and chemotherapy, compared to 12% of those receiving chemotherapy alone.

Improved progression-free survival was observed in all groups of patients who received immunotherapy and chemotherapy, including those with PD-L1-negative tumors and liver metastases. Overall survival data are not yet mature.

This is the first phase III trial of an immunotherapy-based combined modality treatment to show a significant improvement in progression-free survival in advanced squamous NSCLC, according to the authors. Although the difference between treatment groups is modest, a statistically significant improvement shows that, overall, people with advanced squamous lung cancer can benefit when immunotherapy is added to standard treatment, according to the authors.

Although the rate of severe side effects was higher with the combined modality treatment than with chemotherapy alone (68% vs. 57%), it had a manageable safety profile, consistent with known safety risks of the individual therapies. The most common side effects of atezolizumab included skin rash, colitis, and low thyroid hormone.

At this interim analysis a statistically significant overall survival (OS) benefit was not observed (median OS was 14 months for atezolizumab plus chemotherapy vs. 13.9 months for chemotherapy alone). Researchers are continuing to follow patients and anticipate a subsequent analysis later this year.

Next Steps

More research is needed to determine which patients benefit the most from the addition of immunotherapy to standard chemotherapy. The researchers will explore tumor PD-L1 expression and other molecular markers, such as tumor mutational burden (TMB), that may predict whether a patient will benefit from this treatment regimen.

This study received funding from F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd.

"A blood test for 10 different types of cancers could one day help doctors screen for the disease before patients show symptoms, researchers at the world’s largest gathering of oncologists have said.

The test, called a liquid biopsy, screens for cancer by detecting tiny bits of DNA released by cancer cells into blood. The test had particularly good results for ovarian and pancreatic cancers, though the number of cancers detected was small.

Researchers hope the test will become part of a “universal screening” tool that doctors can use to detect cancer in patients.

“This is potentially the holy grail of cancer research, to find cancers that are currently hard to cure at an earlier stage when they are easier to cure,” said Dr Eric Klein, lead author of the research from Cleveland Clinic’s Taussig Cancer Institute. “We hope this test could save many lives.”

The study, by a research team that also included scientists from Stanford University, was presented at the annual conference of the American Society of Clinical Oncologists in Chicago.

Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, said “new techniques” such as cancer blood tests could “unlock enormous survival gains, as well as dramatic productivity benefits in the practice of medicine”.

“Now, as the NHS marks its 70th anniversary, we stand on the cusp of a new era of personalised medicine that will dramatically transform care for cancer and for inherited and rare diseases,” said Stevens.

The research scrutinised the cases of more than 1,600 people, 749 of whom were cancer-free at the time of the study, with no diagnosis, and 878 of whom had been newly diagnosed with a disease.

The test was most accurate for diagnosing pancreatic, ovarian, liver and gallbladder cancers, correctly finding the diseases in at least four out of five patients.

The blood test found lymphoma and myeloma with slightly less accuracy, at 77% and 73%, and bowel cancer in two out of three patients. Lung cancer was detected in 59% of patients. Head and neck cancer was detected in 56% of patients.

Researchers said their results showed promise in the approach of blood screenings for cancer, but noted further “clinical development” was needed.

The number of patients in whom cancers were detected was small. For example, although the test detected ovarian cancer with 90% accuracy, only 10 ovarian cancers in total were detected.

Nevertheless, researchers aim to develop a tool that could be used by for all people regardless of their family history. “Potentially this test could be used for everybody,” said Klein.

Prof Nicholas Turner from the Institute of Cancer Research in London described the findings as really exciting and as a possible universal screening tool. “Far too many cancers are picked up too late, when it is no longer possible to operate and the chances of survival are slim,” he said. “The goal is to develop a blood test, such as this one, that can accurately identify cancers in their earliest stages.”

Klein added: “It is several steps away and more research is needed, but it could be given to healthy adults of a certain age, such as those over 40, to see if they have early signs of cancer.”"	'Holy grail of cancer research': doctors positive about early detection blood test	2018-06-01 06:00:00	https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/01/doctors-welcome-possible-holy-grail-of-cancer-research	story_reviews_00066	fake
"From Chaos To Calm: A Life Changed By Ketamine

Enlarge this image Maria Fabrizio for NPR Maria Fabrizio for NPR

For six years now, life has been really good for James. He has a great job as the creative director of an advertising firm in New York City. He enjoys spending time with his wife and kids.

And it has all been possible, he says, because for the past six years he has been taking a drug called ketamine.

Before ketamine, James was unable to work or focus his thoughts. His mind was filled with violent images. And his mood could go from ebullient to dark in a matter of minutes.

Ketamine ""helped me get my life back,"" says James, who asked that we not use his last name to protect his career.

Ketamine was developed as a human and animal anesthetic in the 1960s. And almost from the time it reached the market it has also been used as a mind-bending party drug.

But ketamine's story took a surprising turn in 2006, when researchers at the National Institutes of Health showed that an intravenous dose could relieve severe depression in a matter of hours. Since then, doctors have prescribed ketamine ""off label"" to thousands of depressed patients who don't respond to other drugs.

And pharmaceutical companies are testing several new ketamine-related drugs to treat depression. Johnson & Johnson expects to seek approval for its nasal spray esketamine later this year, though the approval would be limited to use in a clinical setting.

Meanwhile, doctors have begun trying ketamine on patients with a wide range of psychiatric disorders other than depression. And there is now growing evidence it can help people with anxiety, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and perhaps even obsessive-compulsive disorder.

""I think it's actually one of the biggest advances in psychiatry in a very long time,"" says Dr. Martin Teicher, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the Developmental Biopsychiatry Research Program at McLean Hospital.

Ketamine may also offer new hope for people like James who have symptoms of several different psychiatric disorders.

James had a happy childhood, he says. But his thoughts were out of control. ""I always felt like I was crossing a freeway and my thoughts were just racing past me,"" he says.

He spent much of his childhood terrified of ""an unknown, an ambiguous force out there."" The fear was ""overwhelming,"" he says. ""I literally slept with the cover over my head with just room to breathe through my mouth until I went to college.""

And there was something else about James: his body temperature.

""I overheated constantly,"" he says. ""I would wear shorts all year long. In my 20s in my apartment I would sleep with the windows open in the middle of the winter.""

In his late 20s, James saw a doctor who told him he had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. So he started taking stimulants.

At first, the pills helped him focus. Then they didn't, no matter how many he took.

He'd done well as an idea guy in the advertising industry. But now James was trying to work at home, and it wasn't going well.

""ADHD pills will make you interested in anything,"" he says. ""So I was putting the desk together and taking the desk apart. I was putting a laptop stand together and taking it apart. I was going in a massive downward spiral.""

James had always suffered from mood swings. But now they were rapid and extreme. And he couldn't stop thinking about gruesome scenarios, like a murderer coming for his family.

""My wife took a summer off to be with me because she was scared of what was going to happen to me,"" he says. ""She would go to work for a few hours, then rush home. There would be times I'd call her just screaming, 'Please come home. I can't get through another minute.' ""

Eventually, James found his way to Dr. Demitri Papolos, an associate professor of clinical psychiatry at Albert Einstein College of Medicine.

""He was like a whirling dervish when he came into my office,"" Papolos says. ""He was extremely fearful and scanning the environment all the time and he overheated at the drop of a hat.""

Papolos diagnosed James with a variant of bipolar disorder he calls the ""fear of harm phenotype."" It typically appears in childhood and often doesn't respond to traditional psychiatric drugs.

But Papolos has found that the condition does respond to ketamine. ""It's been transformational,"" he says.

In January, Papolos published a study of 45 children with the problem. They inhaled a nasal mist containing ketamine about twice a week. Nearly all got dramatically better.

Scientists still aren't sure why ketamine works, but there's evidence that it encourages the brain to rewire, to alter the connections between cells. That process has been linked to recovery from depression. And it may also explain why ketamine helps people who have symptoms associated with several different psychiatric disorders.

""I think it's having multiple effects, and that means it's probably useful for multiple different disorders,"" Teicher says.

One of those effects involves a part of the brain involved in temperature regulation. And that could explain why patients like James usually stop overheating once they are taking ketamine.

James started taking a ketamine nasal spray every other day. He says his response was dramatic.

""One day I turn to my wife and I'm like, 'I feel calm today. I don't know if it's the sun coming in, I don't know if it's just the way we're sitting here, but I feel like I could go and sit at the computer and work.' ""

The next day, James did sit down at his computer. A month later, he was back at work."	From Chaos To Calm: A Life Changed By Ketamine	2018-06-04 06:00:00	https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/06/04/615671405/from-chaos-to-calm-a-life-changed-by-ketamine	story_reviews_00065	fake
"(Reuters Health) - A system of automated twice-daily texts and the ability to use text messaging to receive answers to questions about treatment helps relieve some of the stress of chemotherapy for women with breast cancer, researchers at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia reported Monday.

The feasibility study was designed to see if texting could relieve some of the anxiety that comes with the fatigue, hair loss and other body changes that can accompany anticancer drugs.

Compared to 52 women who only received an American Cancer Society pamphlet on chemotherapy, the 48 women in the texting group reported an overall lower level of distress and a higher quality of life during their therapy. They also felt they had better communication with their doctors.

The text messages were most effective at reducing distress at the 2- and 4-month marks, according to the data presented by chief author Kuang-Yi Wen, an assistant professor in the Cancer Prevention and Control program at Fox Chase. At the fourth month mark, “the gap was huge” between the texting and control groups, she told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.

Texting also played a role in helping patients feel like they were in control of their treatment, particularly during the first month.

Texting did not affect the odds of developing symptoms of depression.

Surprisingly, the older the patient, the greater the likelihood that she would text back, seeking more information.

One of the patients texted the program 1,217 times. “That’s what’s good about this program. Everyone has different information-seeking behavior” and the system can respond to that, Dr. Wen said.

The findings were released at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago.

Automatic texting helps ease stress of chemotherapy in breast cancer patients	2018-06-04 22:33:59	https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-cancer-breast-texting/automatic-texting-helps-ease-stress-of-chemotherapy-in-breast-cancer-patients-idUSKCN1J02L6	story_reviews_00064	fake
"PHILADELPHIA - In a finding that suggests the potential for practice change that would reduce the use of antibiotics in dermatology, researchers in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania have found the diuretic drug spironolactone may be just as effective as antibiotics for the treatment of women's acne. The study, published this month in the Journal of Drugs and Dermatology, found patients who were originally prescribed spironolactone changed to a different drug within one year at almost the same rate as those who were prescribed antibiotics. The prescription change is a proxy for ineffectiveness, since switching is often the result of treatment failure due to lack of efficacy, side effects, cost, or other factors.

Acne is one of the most common diseases in the world. It affects 85 percent of people under the age of 18, but it also regularly impacts adults. More than 50 percent of women in the United States are treated for acne between the ages of 20 and 29, while more than 35 percent are treated between the ages of 30 and 39.

Oral antibiotics are the most common systemic treatment for acne, and when combined with the large patient population, the result is that dermatologists prescribe the highest level of antibiotics per provider among all medical specialties, according to the Centers for Disease Control - a fact that contributes to concerns about increased resistance to antibiotics across all fields of medicine.

""It's clear that a safe alternative to oral antibiotics could have a huge benefit, and our data show spironolactone may be that alternative,"" said the study's lead author John S. Barbieri, MD, MBA, Dermatology chief resident at Penn. David J. Margolis, MD, PhD, a professor of Dermatology, was the study's senior author.

Spironolactone, marketed under the name aldactone, is currently approved to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and conditions that cause people to retain fluid. It blocks the effects of male hormones like androgen, meaning it's not an option to treat acne in men. However, those same anti-hormonal effects can help prevent acne outbreaks in women. As a result, some dermatologists use it to treat female acne patients.

Researchers compared data on 6,684 women and girls taking spironolactone to 31,614 who were prescribed antibiotics. Within a year, 14.4 percent of spironolactone patients and 13.4 percent of antibiotic patients had switched to alternative treatments, suggesting each treatment was working at almost the same rate, despite the fact that tetracycline-class antibiotics are prescribed five times as frequently.

""These numbers suggest dermatologists should consider spironolactone first instead of antibiotics when it comes to women with acne,"" Barbieri said.

In addition to the benefits for antibiotic stewardship, Barbieri pointed to several studies showing long-term oral antibiotic use may be associated with antibiotic resistance, lupus, inflammatory bowel disease, and even colon and breast cancer.

""This indicates spironolactone may have a better safety profile than oral antibiotics, which is another factor that makes it such an appealing option,"" Barbieri said. He also noted spironolactone is less expensive, which may be relevant to patients with high deductibles or who are uninsured.

Spironolactone is not approved for the treatment of acne by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration despite expert opinion supporting its use, and Barbieri says the findings of this study should be confirmed by a randomized controlled trial that directly compares the two treatment options.

"Scientists have developed a spit test that could identify the men most at risk of developing prostate cancer.

By testing a man’s DNA, researchers can look for genes linked to the disease, which one in seven men in the Western world will be diagnosed with in their lifetime.

Scientists in the U.K. and U.S. who helped piece together the study, published in Nature Genetics, found 63 new gene variants linked to prostate cancer. This was achieved by assessing the DNA of 80,000 prostate cancer patients and 61,000 men without the disease.

The resulting test hones in on these and the existing 100 known markers to pinpoint the 1 percent of men who are at six times greater risk of developing the condition, and the 10 percent of men who have a threefold greater risk of developing the disease, a study author told The Guardian.

The new method is being trialed on 300 men in doctor surgeries across London, and is due to be expanded to 5,000 next year, according to BBC News.

If it is found to be effective, it could be an important tool for physicians. Although prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. after lung, few risk factors have been found, and it is difficult to accurately diagnose.

Most men with prostate cancer do not experience symptoms. Doctors can use the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test to detect protein produced by prostate and cancerous cells, respectively. But as these antigens can be present in men without the cancer, it carries a risk of returning a false positive that can kick-start unnecessary, life-changing treatment. Rectal examinations and biopsies are also used to test for the disease.

According to the American Cancer Society, over 160,600 new cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed each year, and around 29,400 people die of the disease. The condition is rare in those below the age of 40; older men and African-Americans are most at risk. The majority of cases are caught at around 66.

Rosalind Eeles, an author of the study at the U.K.-based Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) who specializes in finding genetic variants that increase the risk of prostate cancer, told The Guardian the team is “excited by the test” because it can be used by doctors to offer patients targeted screenings.

Carl Alexander, a spokesman from the charity Cancer Research UK, said: “This study is an exciting example of how research can find clues in our genes to help us uncover those more likely to develop the disease. The next steps should be to understand how this research can be developed into tests that could identify men who might be more likely to develop aggressive cancers, and how this could be rolled out to patients.”

Dr. Iain Frame, the director of research at the charity Prostate Cancer UK, highlighted that men with a family history of prostate cancer are two-and-a-half times more likely to be diagnosed with the disease compared to a man with no family history.

""With Father’s Day fast approaching, use it as an opportunity to ask your dad, your brother, your uncle, your friends about their risk of prostate cancer. It’s a conversation that could save their life,"" he said."

"TITUSVILLE, N.J., June 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson today announced results from the MERCURY PE study, which showed that people with low-risk pulmonary embolism (PE) treated with XARELTO® (rivaroxaban) and discharged from the emergency department had significantly reduced time in the hospital and a median savings of $2,496 in per patient costs, compared to standard of care in-patient treatment. Results from MERCURY PE, which evaluated the benefits of treating patients with low-risk PE with XARELTO® and discharging them early from the emergency department to complete treatment at home, were published in Academic Emergency Medicine.

Click to Tweet: New study shows out-patient use of Janssen #bloodthinner results in cost savings and reduces time in hospital for low-risk PE patients https://ctt.ac/RZ2ka+

""Every year, U.S. health care systems spend more than two billion dollars to manage patients with pulmonary emboli,"" said principal study investigator W. Frank Peacock, MD, FACEP, FACC, Associate Chair and Research Director, Emergency Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX. ""By avoiding hospitalizations that are not clinically necessary and transitioning patients with low-risk PE to out-patient treatment with XARELTO®, we've seen significant cost savings, which could help alleviate the burden on health care systems.""



Venous thromboembolism (VTE) includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a blood clot in a deep vein, and PE, a potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when a blood clot travels to the lung. Of the approximately 900,000 Americans who experience a VTE each yeari, more than 250,000 are diagnosed with PE in the emergency departmentii. Hospitals across the United States have varying protocols for managing PE, but standard of care typically requires people to be admitted for treatment, which drives up costs and substantially increases hospital-acquired conditions and infectionsiii,iv. While people with more severe PE have higher mortality rates, the 30-day mortality rate of low-risk PE is less than one percentv.

MERCURY PE met its primary efficacy endpoint, with XARELTO® leading to significantly reduced time in the hospital due to VTE or bleeding within 30 days after randomization compared with the standard of care (mean duration of 4.8 vs. 33.6 hours, respectively; 95% CI; p<0.0001). The mean difference of length of stay between the two groups was 28.8 hours. Of note, there was no recurrence of VTE or VTE-related death or any significant differences in the bleeding-related hospitalizations or physician visits within 90 days from randomization in either group, though this outcome should be interpreted with caution, as the study was significantly underpowered to detect any such differences.

""We're proud to have pioneered this groundbreaking research, which was the first prospective randomized trial to confirm the benefit of discharging patients with low-risk PE early from the hospital and completing treatment at home,"" said Paul Burton, MD, PhD, FACC, Vice President, Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC. ""We expect that this XARELTO® study will prompt physicians to reconsider how patients with low-risk PE are managed.""

About MERCURY-PE

Patients with low-risk PE were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to open label XARELTO® or standard of care within 12 hours of diagnosis. Patients randomized to XARELTO® were discharged from the emergency department within 24 hours and were instructed to take XARELTO® 15 mg twice daily for 21 days, then XARELTO® 20 mg once daily until the study was completed. Patients randomized to standard of care were treated per local hospital protocol, which could include hospitalization and any U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved anticoagulant strategy, including XARELTO®.

Researchers also made the following observations about XARELTO® in this setting:

The mean length of initial and subsequent hospitalizations for any reason was shorter for patients who were discharged early on XARELTO ® within 90 days from randomization compared to those receiving standard of care (p=0.024; 19.2 hours vs. 43.2 hours, respectively).

within 90 days from randomization compared to those receiving standard of care (p=0.024; 19.2 hours vs. 43.2 hours, respectively). There was no major bleeding in either group within 90 days from randomization, although two patients reported clinically relevant non-major bleeding, one in each group. There were no deaths due to bleeding in the study.

Overall, early discharge on XARELTO® was markedly less expensive than standard of care. The cost associated with the emergency room visit and any subsequent hospitalization at the time of PE diagnosis and the total costs were $2,638 (p<0.001) and $2,496 (p<0.001) less with XARELTO®.

MERCURY PE builds on prior research, including a June 2015 study published in Academic Emergency Medicine showing that 106 patients with low-risk PE or DVT, when prescribed XARELTO® and immediately discharged, had no recurrent events while on therapy. Additionally, no major or clinically relevant bleeding events were observed. A companion study found patients with low-risk PE or DVT who were prescribed XARELTO® had significantly lower medical costs than those admitted and given standard treatment.

The clinical and economic benefits demonstrated in the MERCURY-PE trial have been confirmed in more than 3,100 U.S. patients in a real-world study, showing that XARELTO® resulted in a significant one-day reduction in hospital length of stay and significantly lower total healthcare costs (approximately $2,000).

MERCURY PE Patient Satisfaction Results

Patient satisfaction, both with out-patient and in-patient care, was also analyzed using Likert scales and the Anti-Clot Treatment Score (ACTS). On the Likert scales, most patients in both groups indicated they were ""very satisfied"" with their care, but numerically more patients taking XARELTO® preferred to receive outpatient care (50 percent) compared to slightly less than half of patients receiving in-patient standard of care (47.5 percent). The ACTS measured the patient's perspective on the burden of treatment, with more patients taking XARELTO® reporting it was ""not at all"" burdensome compared to those receiving standard of care (64.4 percent vs. 54.4 percent).

About MERCURY PE

MERCURY PE was a randomized, open label, parallel-group, multicenter trial conducted at 35 hospitals across the U.S. Adult patients who arrived at the emergency department with confirmed, low-risk PE (defined by the absence of any Hestia criteria) were eligible for enrollment. Of the 114 patients randomized, 99 completed the study (44 in the XARELTO® group and 55 in the standard of care group). Patients who did not complete the study were mainly lost to follow-up or adverse events. Analyses were conducted by intention-to-treat basis, regardless of the anticoagulant used.

The primary efficacy outcome was the total amount of time spent in the hospital (in hours) for VTE or bleeding events in the 30 days after randomization. Hospital readmissions for reasons unrelated to VTE were excluded. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding within 90 days. Secondary efficacy endpoints included 90-day rates of new/recurrent VTE, VTE-related death, unplanned hospital or physician office visits for VTE or bleeding, total length of initial or subsequent hospitalizations for any reason, patient-reported satisfaction, and total costs of care. A secondary safety endpoint was clinically relevant non-major bleeding based on International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) definitions.

MERCURY PE also had a few limitations, including sample size (study enrolled 114 of a planned 300 patients), exclusion bias based on subjective evaluation of hemodynamic stability and ability to adhere to protocol, and potential bias due to inability to blind patients to their admission status.

About EXPLORER

MERCURY PE is part of the EXPLORER program, which is unmatched by any oral anticoagulant in the Factor Xa inhibitor class in its size, scope and ambition. A collaborative effort between Janssen and its development partner Bayer, EXPLORER seeks to generate important clinical evidence on the safety and efficacy of XARELTO® and its potential role in addressing critical unmet medical needs. A number of the studies in the program are designed to seek additional indications or expand the label for XARELTO® to benefit more patients in need of additional therapies for their cardiovascular disease. By the time of its completion, more than 275,000 patients will have participated in the EXPLORER clinical development program, other completed and ongoing clinical trials, investigative registries and non-interventional studies.

WHAT IS XARELTO®?

XARELTO® (rivaroxaban) is a prescription medicine used to reduce the risk of stroke and blood clots in people with atrial fibrillation not caused by a heart valve problem. For patients currently well managed on warfarin, there is limited information on how XARELTO® and warfarin compare in reducing the risk of stroke.

XARELTO® is also a prescription medicine used to treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and to reduce the risk of blood clots happening again in people who continue to be at risk for DVT or PE after receiving treatment for blood clots for at least 6 months.

XARELTO® is also a prescription medicine used to reduce the risk of forming a blood clot in the legs and lungs of people who have just had knee or hip replacement surgery.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

What is the most important information I should know about XARELTO® (rivaroxaban)?

For people taking XARELTO® for atrial fibrillation:

People with atrial fibrillation (an irregular heart beat) are at an increased risk of forming a blood clot in the heart, which can travel to the brain, causing a stroke, or to other parts of the body. XARELTO® lowers your chance of having a stroke by helping to prevent clots from forming. If you stop taking XARELTO®, you may have increased risk of forming a clot in your blood.

Do not stop taking XARELTO® without talking to the doctor who prescribes it for you. Stopping XARELTO® increases your risk of having a stroke.

If you have to stop taking XARELTO®, your doctor may prescribe another blood thinner medicine to prevent a blood clot from forming.

XARELTO® can cause bleeding, which can be serious, and rarely may lead to death. This is because XARELTO® is a blood thinner medicine (anticoagulant) that reduces blood clotting. While you take XARELTO® you are likely to bruise more easily, and it may take longer for bleeding to stop.

You may have a higher risk of bleeding if you take XARELTO® and take other medicines that increase your risk of bleeding, including:

Aspirin or aspirin-containing products



Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)



Warfarin sodium (Coumadin ® , Jantoven ® )

, Jantoven )

Any medicine that contains heparin



Clopidogrel (Plavix ® )

)

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)



Other medicines to prevent or treat blood clots

Tell your doctor if you take any of these medicines. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure if your medicine is one listed above.

Call your doctor or get medical help right away if you develop any of these signs or symptoms of bleeding:

Unexpected bleeding or bleeding that lasts a long time, such as:

Nosebleeds that happen often



Unusual bleeding from gums



Menstrual bleeding that is heavier than normal, or vaginal bleeding

Bleeding that is severe or you cannot control

Red, pink, or brown urine

Bright red or black stools (looks like tar)

Cough up blood or blood clots

Vomit blood or your vomit looks like ""coffee grounds""

Headaches, feeling dizzy or weak

Pain, swelling, or new drainage at wound sites

Spinal or epidural blood clots (hematoma): People who take a blood thinner medicine like XARELTO ® , and have medicine injected into their spinal and epidural area, or have a spinal puncture, have a risk of forming a blood clot that can cause long-term or permanent loss of the ability to move (paralysis). Your risk of developing a spinal or epidural blood clot is higher if:

People who take a blood thinner medicine like XARELTO , and have medicine injected into their spinal and epidural area, or have a spinal puncture, have a risk of forming a blood clot that can cause long-term or permanent loss of the ability to move (paralysis). Your risk of developing a spinal or epidural blood clot is higher if: A thin tube called an epidural catheter is placed in your back to give you certain medicine



You take NSAIDs or a medicine to prevent blood from clotting



You have a history of difficult or repeated epidural or spinal punctures



You have a history of problems with your spine or have had surgery on your spine

If you take XARELTO® and receive spinal anesthesia or have a spinal puncture, your doctor should watch you closely for symptoms of spinal or epidural blood clots. Tell your doctor right away if you have back pain, tingling, numbness, muscle weakness (especially in your legs and feet), or loss of control of the bowels or bladder (incontinence).

XARELTO® is not for people with artificial heart valves.

Do not take XARELTO® if you:

Currently have certain types of abnormal bleeding. Talk to your doctor before taking XARELTO ® if you currently have unusual bleeding.

TUESDAY, June 19, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- New research suggests that a single blood test could confirm type 2 diabetes, saving patients time and health care costs.

Currently, it's recommended that a blood test focused on elevated fasting levels of blood sugar (glucose) or a blood component called glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) be confirmed with a second blood test at a follow-up visit.

But taking the test twice takes up time and money and could still result in missed diagnoses, said a team from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.

In the new study, researchers led by Hopkins epidemiologist Elizabeth Selvin looked at data on more than 13,000 people in a long-running U.S. heart disease study. The study began in the 1980s, and along the way has recorded valuable data from participants, including diabetes test data.

Selvin's group analyzed that data, and reported that a positive result for glucose and HbA1c from just a single blood sample can confirm type 2 diabetes.

This could change care, ""potentially allowing a major simplification of current clinical practice guidelines,"" Selvin said in a university news release. ""Doctors are already doing these [glucose and HbA1c] tests together -- if a patient is obese, for example, and has other risk factors for diabetes, the physician is likely to order tests for both glucose and HbA1c from a single blood sample.

""It's just that the guidelines don't clearly let you use the tests from that one blood sample to make the initial diabetes diagnosis,"" she explained.

Diabetes is treatable, but about 3 million Americans with the disease don't know they have it.

""I'm hoping that these results will lead to a change in the clinical guidelines when they are revised in early 2019, which could make identifying diabetes a lot more efficient in many cases,"" Selvin said.

Diabetes experts welcomed the findings.

""Diabetes moves fast, and the cost of diabetes has increased more than 20 percent since 2012,"" noted Dr. Robert Courgi. The new study ""helps us move quicker to treat diabetes,"" he said.

""By diagnosing diabetes quicker, we can improve outcomes,"" said Courgi, an endocrinologist at Northwell Health's Southside Hospital in Bay Shore, N.Y. ""The current standard is to delay diagnosis with repeat office visits and blood work. Now we can educate the patient sooner and start treatment earlier to prevent complications of diabetes such as heart attack, dialysis and amputations.""

Dr. Gerald Bernstein coordinates the Friedman Diabetes Program at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. He agreed that quicker diagnosis could mean better treatment and outcomes for patients.

""The CDC reports that greater than 52 percent of the U.S. population has either clinical diabetes or prediabetes,"" Bernstein noted. ""Given these numbers, any abnormality of glucose should be regarded as sufficient reason to start preventative treatment with an education program, lifestyle change and first-line medication such as metformin.""

According to Bernstein, if only one diagnostic test were needed, ""this would mean that a follow-up visit would be a look at the treatment benefits -- rather than a confirmation of an abnormal glucose.""

The study was published June 19 in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine.

"Fasting diets have gained popularity in the past few years, but the scientific evidence proving that they keep us healthy while they help us lose weight is sparse. Now, researchers have shed light on what one type of time-restricted eating does to the body.

In a small, preliminary study, researchers put 23 obese volunteers on the 16:8 diet, a form of intermittent fasting. Followers of the popular regime eat during an eight-hour window, in this case between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. And for the 16 hours in between, they consume only calorie-free drinks, such as water.

For 12 weeks, the scientists measured various factors, including the participants' fat mass, blood pressure and cholesterol and glucose levels. The researchers compared the results to existing data from a separate weight loss trial carried out between 2011 and 2015.

Individuals who ate between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. consumed around 350 fewer calories, resulting in a loss of 3 percent body weight, and their blood pressure dropped by around 7mm Hg. However, their fat mass, insulin resistance and cholesterol levels were similar to the control group's.

Krista Varady, one of the study's authors and associate professor of kinesiology and nutrition at the University of Illinois at Chicago's School of Applied Health Sciences, said in a statement that the take-home message from the study is that cutting out certain foods or counting calories aren’t the only effective methods for losing weight.

The authors noted that the results mirror those from previous studies of other forms of intermittent fasting, including alternate day fasting, where an individual eats normally every other day.

""But one of the benefits of the 16:8 diet may be that it is easier for people to maintain. We observed that fewer participants dropped out of this study when compared to studies on other fasting diets,” said Varady.

Further research is now needed to uncover whether 16:8 works better than other fasting diets in terms of weight loss and health benefits.

The study's authors acknowledged that their preliminary data offers ""promise for the use of time-restricted feeding as a weight loss technique in obese adults, but longer-term, large-scale randomized controlled trials [are needed].""

Varady stressed that ""when it comes to weight loss, people need to find what works for them, because even small amounts of success can lead to improvements in metabolic health.""

Commenting broadly on fast-style diets, James Catterson of the Institute of Healthy Ageing at University College London, who was not involved in the study, previously told Newsweek the jury is still out on fasting diets.

He said that the data on the effects of fasting in animals are more convincing, probably because animals can be investigated in large sample sizes and in a highly controlled environment that is almost impossible to replicate in humans.

""There are also many studies that either report no overall effect or sometimes the opposite. And this is where it gets a bit murky, as it is very difficult to put proper controls in place when performing studies to do with nutrition,"" Catterson said.

He concluded, ""So far, the consensus seems to be ‘let’s wait until more rigorous studies, with larger sample sizes that adjust for confounding lifestyle behaviors, have been performed before we conclude anything prematurely.'"""	16:8 Fasting Diet Linked to Weight Loss and Health Benefits in Study	2018-06-19 16:00:10	https://web.archive.org/web/20180622115323/http://www.newsweek.com:80/168-fasting-diet-linked-weight-loss-health-benefits-study-983832	story_reviews_00061	true
"An experimental therapy for type 1 diabetes, widely derided by mainstream diabetes researchers, lowered blood sugar levels to near normal, a small, ongoing trial found. Patients in the trial, whose blood sugar levels have remained near normal for five to eight years, take about one-third less insulin than they did before, reducing their risk of hypoglycemia, in which insulin lowers blood sugar to dangerously low levels.

The experimental treatment, a decades-old generic vaccine for tuberculosis called bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), seems to alter both cellular metabolism and the immune system, said Dr. Denise Faustman of Massachusetts General Hospital, senior author of the study published Thursday in npj Vaccines. “This cheap, old vaccine is lowering blood sugar to levels never achieved before,” she said.

While the results, from only nine patients, must be replicated in a larger study, said Dr. Joseph Bellanti of Georgetown University Medical Center, “if what they found is true, they really have something here.” Bellanti, who was not involved in the research, said the study’s eight-year follow-up and use of a placebo control arm made him “cautiously optimistic” that two doses of the BCG vaccine “can decrease levels of A1c,” a measure of blood glucose that predicts the likelihood of serious complications such as stroke and kidney failure.

JDRF (formerly the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation), the Joslin Diabetes Center, and several university diabetes centers all declined to speak about Faustman’s results. She has been a voice in the diabetes wilderness for nearly two decades, angering the establishment diabetes community by pursuing low-tech research very different from more popular approaches, such as embryonic stem cells and immunosupression.

Critics have gone so far as to send letters to newspapers that covered her work apologizing to patients “on behalf of Dr. Faustman” for “having their expectations cruelly raised.” She has also struggled for funding, receiving much of her research support from the private Iacocca Family Foundation, rather than in federal grants.

In Faustman’s Phase 1 clinical trial, three participants with type 1 diabetes received two doses of BCG vaccine, a month apart. After the vaccine showed signs of effectiveness, an additional six patients were vaccinated five years ago, and 111 more recently. The new paper and a presentation scheduled for a meeting of the American Diabetes Association this weekend focus on the patients who have been followed for more than five years.

All of those patients who received BCG had a statistically significant change in hemoglobin A1c. A normal level is below 6. In the vaccinated patients, A1c levels fell from an average of 7.36 before the first dose to 6.18 after five years, holding almost steady at 6.65 in the eighth year. In patients receiving a sham injection, levels showed almost no change from their initial levels of 7.10: 7.07 in the fifth year and 7.22 in the eighth.

“We wanted it to be good, but we didn’t know it would be this good,” Faustman said.

All of the patients remain on insulin, she said, but less of it. They are also able to monitor their blood sugar less frequently, which can be several times an hour. (The standard of care is a continuous glucose monitor, in which a probe is inserted into the abdomen, plus an insulin pump.) “If we can gradually move people to where they can control their blood sugar, their minute-to-minute lifestyle can improve dramatically,” Faustman said.

The A1c reductions could also bring significant health benefits. Every 10 percent drop, research shows, reduces complications such as stroke and heart attack by about one-third. The BCG vaccine lowered A1c levels 9 percent to 16 percent.

The new paper describes how the BCG vaccine, which has been used for nearly 100 years against tuberculosis and is considered extremely safe, might affect diabetes. According to studies in mice, it has two effects. It alters the immune system so as to increase levels of T regulatory cells; T regs keep other immune cells in check, including those that attack the pancreas’s insulin-making cells — the root cause of type 1 diabetes. In addition, BCG alters metabolism so cells consume higher levels of glucose, drawing more of it out of the blood, in a process called aerobic glycolysis.

“The clinical effects and the proposed mechanism demonstrated are exciting and add to the emerging consensus that the BCG vaccine can have a lasting and valuable impact on the immune system,” said Dr. Mihai Netea of Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands, who was not involved in the study.

A Phase 2 clinical trial of BCG is currently underway at Mass. General. It is testing multiple BCG doses in 150 patients with longstanding type 1 diabetes.

Although many studies of BCG are underway around the world in diabetes and other autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, there has been little interest among U.S. researchers outside Faustman’s lab.

“There is not a lot of enthusiasm because we’re all rewarded for discovering for-profit drugs,” she said. “Potential funders come [to my lab] and ask, ‘How can we make money off this?’”

BCG, whose one licensed manufacturer in the U.S. is Merck subsidiary Organon Teknika, costs less than a dollar a dose. (Faustman used a strain made by Sanofi (SNY).) The U.S. market for insulin meters and insulin pumps is $20 billion. “With everyone thinking they need a pump and a meter, if you come along with an inexpensive vaccine that can change this standard of care, of course there will be pushback,” Faustman said."

"Epidiolex was approved for patients age 2 and older who suffer from Lennox-Gastaut and Dravet syndromes. Both cause uncontrolled daily seizures and put patients at high risk for other physical and intellectual disabilities, injury and early death.

AD

The disorders afflict fewer than 45,000 people in the United States, but experts expect Epidiolex to be prescribed for other types of epilepsy as well. The drug is the first treatment approved for Dravet syndrome.

AD

FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the approval was “a reminder that advancing sound development programs that properly evaluate active ingredients contained in marijuana can lead to important medical therapies.” The medication, tested in three randomized, placebo-controlled trials with more than 500 patients, was effective in reducing seizures, the FDA said.

Gottlieb noted that the action was “not an approval of marijuana or all of its components” but rather of one specific CBD medication for a particular use.

AD

The agency, he added, remains concerned about “the proliferation and illegal marketing of unapproved CBD-containing products with unproven medical claims.”

In April, an advisory committee unanimously recommended approval of the drug for the two types of epilepsy.

The FDA previously cleared medications containing synthetic versions of THC for nausea for patients getting chemotherapy and for other uses, but it had not approved any drug derived from the plant itself. Marijuana and its components, including CBD, are Schedule 1 controlled substances — meaning they are banned because they are thought to have a high abuse potential, no medical value and serious safety implications.

AD

AD

Now that Epidiolex is approved by the FDA, cannabidiol is expected to be reclassified by the Drug Enforcement Administration within 90 days. However, it isn’t clear whether such a reclassification would involve CBD products in general, the CBD formulation used specifically in Epidiolex or something else.

For those who have long argued that cannabis offers medical benefits, the FDA approval represents a milestone, “a recognition that the plant is a rich source of compounds which have potential therapeutic activity,” Justin Gover, chief executive of GW Pharmaceuticals, the London-based company that developed the drug, said in an interview last week. “We are just scratching the surface of what could be a range of cannabis-based medications.”

The medication, which will continue to be manufactured in Britain, will be marketed by Greenwich Biosciences, the U.S. subsidiary of GW Pharmaceuticals. The drugmaker is testing other CBD treatments for glioblastoma and schizophrenia.

AD

AD

Shlomo Shinnar, president of the American Epilepsy Society and a neurologist at Montefiore Medical Center in New York, has said the drug will be “a very valuable addition” to the limited options for treating severe childhood-onset epilepsy. Shinnar said he will welcome approval of a medicine that had undergone stringent FDA review for safety and effectiveness.

Many parents already are giving children unregulated CBD formulations that are available in medical marijuana dispensaries in the many states where such operations are legal. Some have said that they have no intention of switching to the new prescription CBD drug because the products they're using are helping their children. Others said they are anxious to try an FDA-approved product.

"Doctors Try Genetically Modified Poliovirus As Experimental Brain Cancer Treatment

A genetically modified poliovirus may help some patients fight a deadly form of brain cancer, researchers report.

The experimental treatment seems to have extended survival in a small group of patients with glioblastoma who faced a grim prognosis because standard treatments had failed, Duke University researchers say.

""I've been doing this for 50 years and I've never seen results like this,"" says Dr. Darell Bigner, the director emeritus of the The Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center at the Duke Cancer Institute, who is helping develop the treatment.

But the researchers and other brain-cancer doctors caution the research is at a very early stage. In the study, only 21 percent of patients experienced a prolonged survival. Much more follow-up research is needed to better assess and hopefully improve the treatment's effectiveness, the researchers say.

""We have to be careful,"" says Annick Desjardins, a Duke neuro-oncologist who helped conduct the study. ""But we have long-term survivors. We are seeing something we don't normally see with patients with glioblastoma.""

Dr. David Reardon, clinical director of the Center for Neuro-Oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, says the Duke group's results may represent ""a good, solid, important step forward"" for patients with no alternatives.

""Unfortunately, for most patients this is not going to be the answer yet,"" says Reardon, who used to work at Duke but wasn't involved in the new research. ""My fear is that every patient and family dealing with the devastating disease of glioblastoma is going to think the poliovirus is the cure. Unfortunately, the patients who are benefiting do reflect a relatively small percentage of the population.""

The Duke results were published online Tuesday by the New England Journal of Medicine to coincide with their presentation at the 22nd International Conference on Brain Tumor Research in Norway.

Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive malignant brain tumor in adults. It's the cancer that killed former Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and former Vice President Joe Biden's son Beau. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is fighting glioblastoma.

The Duke researchers decided to try to use a genetically modified version of the poliovirus, which can cause a devastating form of paralysis, because of the virus's ability to infect nervous system cells.

The scientists removed one of the virus's genes to prevent it from causing polio and replaced that gene with one from a harmless virus known as a rhinovirus, which ordinarily causes the common cold.

The engineered virus was then infused directly into tumors in patients' brains with a tube inserted through a hole in the skull. The modified virus retains the ability to infect and kill brain tumor cells, and also appears to trigger the patient's own immune system cells to attack the tumors, the researchers say.

Between 2012 and 2017, the researchers treated 61 patients, trying various doses of the modified virus to determine which was safest and most effective.

There are substantial risks. The treatment can cause a dangerous swelling in the brain that can lead to seizures and other complications, the researchers found. One patient suffered a life-threatening blood clot in the brain that required surgery.

But overall, the median length of survival was 12.5 months for patients treated with poliovirus, compared with 11.3 months for a similar group of patients treated in the past, the researchers report. And starting at two years after treatment, the two groups' survival rate began to diverge, the researchers reported.

After 24 months, 21 percent of the patients treated with the virus had survived compared with 14 percent of the historical comparison group. After three years, 21 percent of the poliovirus treated patients survived, compared with 4 percent of the other group, according to the researchers.

Two patients have survived more than six years, Bigner says. One has survived more than five years.

""You just don't see this percentage of long-term survivors with this disease,"" Bigner says. ""Those that have survived more than two years are in remission, and we expect them to continue to be long-term survivors.""

Some other researchers praised the results.

""We're extraordinarily encouraged by what we see with this data,"" says Mitchel Berger, chairman of neurosurgery at the University of California, San Francisco and director of its center for brain tumors. ""It's phenomenal.""

But some cancer doctors caution that comparing the outcomes for patients receiving the virus treatment to what would have happened to similar patients in the past could produce misleading conclusions.

The Duke researchers have started a follow-up study combining the treatment with a chemotherapy drug to try to improve the results. They also plan to combine the treatment with other drugs, including some called checkpoint inhibitors, to harness the immune system to fight cancer.

In addition, the researchers are planning to try the approach on children with brain cancer, as well as other types of cancer, including melanoma and breast cancer. ""We believe we are going to be able to increase the results even more significantly,"" Bigner says."

"NEW YORK and SAN DIEGO, June 28, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- An international team of researchers from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK), Epic Sciences, The Institute of Cancer Research, UK, and London Health Sciences Centre, Canada, have shown that a blood test can identify patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who may live longer if they switch from targeted androgen receptor-signaling inhibitor (ARSi) therapy, such as enzalutamide and abiraterone, to taxane-based chemotherapy. This independent, multicenter, blinded study is one of the first studies to validate that a liquid biopsy test can predict therapeutic response and demonstrate a survival benefit. The blood test called, Oncotype DX® AR-V7 Nucleus Detect™ is commercially available in the U.S. through Epic Science's partnership with Genomic Health, Inc. (NASDAQ: GHDX). The research was published online today in JAMA Oncology.

""This liquid biopsy test addresses a critical unmet need at a decision point in management to predict and select the therapy that is most likely to extend a patient's life,"" said Howard Scher, M.D., who led the study and is the co-chair, Center for Mechanism Based Therapy and Head of the Biomarker Development Initiative at MSK. ""During the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer, physicians will now be able to use AR-V7 status to determine when a patient's cancer has become resistant to androgen receptor directed therapy and will respond better to chemotherapy, enabling the patient to live longer.""

This blinded four-year study followed 142 mCRPC patients who were treated at MSK, The Royal Marsden, or the London Health Sciences Centre. Blood samples were obtained prior to treatment with ARSi therapy or chemotherapy and tested with a validated assay for the nuclear-localized androgen receptor splice variant (AR-V7) protein in circulating tumor cells. The results were that patients positive for AR-V7 who were treated with taxane-based chemotherapy had superior overall survival (OS) relative to those treated with ARSI therapy (median OS, 14.3 vs. 7.3 months). Importantly, patients negative for AR-V7 who were treated with ARSi therapy had superior OS relative to those treated with taxanes (media OS, 19.8 vs. 12.8 months). Additionally, the authors validated the test within a prognostic risk group, to ensure that the biomarker effect was due to the biomarker rather than other clinical variables.

""We developed this test specifically to address a significant clinical question in metastatic prostate cancer that previously had no clear answer: which treatment should be pursued next? This question weighs heavily on doctors and patients, but now, with the Oncotype DX AR-V7 test, we can provide them the confidence to know whether continuing with hormonal therapy or switching to chemotherapy will result in better survival outcomes,"" said Ryan Dittamore, chief of medical innovation at Epic Sciences and a co-author on the study. ""In addition, the survival benefit gained through the utilization of our AR-V7 test could make the test as valuable to a patient's outcome as a blockbuster cancer drug.""

This is the second blinded, multi-center clinical utility validation study utilizing the nuclear-localized AR-V7 test. Earlier this month, Dr. Andrew Armstrong of Duke Cancer Institute presented data validating the test in the PROPHECY clinical trial at the ASCO 2018 Annual Meeting. The PROPHECY study investigated the AR-V7 test in patients receiving ARSi therapy and demonstrated that patients who tested positive had worse survival by all measures and had no clinical benefit from ARSi therapy.

In March of this year, based upon earlier studies utilizing the test, Palmetto GBA, a Medicare Administrative Contractor that assesses molecular diagnostic technologies, issued a draft local coverage determination (LCD) for the Oncotype DX® AR-V7 Nucleus Detect™ test. A full LCD for the test is expected in the upcoming months and would support Medicare reimbursement for applicable patients considering ARSI or taxane therapies. It is estimated that 50,000 patients a year may be eligible for and benefit from the Oncotype DX® AR-V7 Nucleus Detect™ test.

The paper is entitled, ""Assessment of the Validity of Nuclear-Localized Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 in Circulating Tumor Cells as a Predictive Biomarker for Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.""

About the Oncotype DX® AR-V7 Nucleus Detect™ Test

Designed by Epic Sciences and based on results from multiple studies led by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the Oncotype DX® AR-V7 Nucleus Detect™ test is the first and only liquid biopsy test of its kind that can potentially prolong the lives of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) by helping their physician identify the most effective treatment. Through a blood draw, the test detects AR-V7 protein in the nucleus of circulating tumor cells utilizing Epic Sciences' No Cell Left Behind® platform to accurately identify patients who are resistant to androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapies and who should instead switch to chemotherapy. The Oncotype DX® AR-V7 Nucleus Detect™ test will be performed by Epic Sciences at its centralized, CLIA-certified laboratory in San Diego and offered exclusively by Genomic Health.

"Long-term follow-up of participants in clinical trials of a generic vaccine to reverse advanced type 1 diabetes finds significant clinical benefits, including restoration of near-normal blood sugar levels. Three years after receiving two administrations of the bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine four weeks apart, all members of a group of adults with longstanding type 1 diabetes showed an improvement in HbA1c to near normal levels - improvement that persisted for the following five years. The study from a Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) research team - published in npj Vaccines - also reports that the effects of BCG vaccine on blood sugar control appear to depend on a totally novel metabolic mechanism that increases cellular consumption of glucose.

""This is clinical validation of the potential to stably lower blood sugars to near normal levels with a safe vaccine, even in patients with longstanding disease,"" says Denise Faustman, MD, PhD, director of the MGH Immunobiology Laboratory , principal investigator of BCG clinical trials at MGH and senior author of the npj Vaccines report. ""In addition to the clinical outcomes, we now have a clear understanding of the mechanisms through which limited BCG vaccine doses can make permanent, beneficial changes to the immune system and lower blood sugars in type 1 diabetes.""

Faustman will also present five-year follow-up results of a separate group of BCG clinical trial participants with longstanding type 1 diabetes on Saturday, June 23, at the 78th Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association in Orlando.

Used for almost a century to prevent tuberculosis, BCG has been known for more than 30 years to boost production of a cytokine called tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which may be beneficial in autoimmune diseases both by eliminating the autoreactive T cells that attack an individual's tissues - in the case of type 1 diabetes, pancreatic islets - and by inducing production of regulatory T cells (Tregs) that could prevent an autoimmune reaction. Faustman's team first reported in 2001 that inducing TNF production could cure type 1 diabetes in mice, but since TNF dosing is toxic in humans, clinical trials have utilized BCG for its ability to elevate TNF levels safely.

Initial clinical trial results, published in a 2012 PLOS One paper, reported that two doses of BCG spaced four weeks apart led to reductions in autoreactive T cells, an increase in Tregs and what turned out to be a transient increase in insulin production. But by the end of that short, 20-week trial, there was no reduction in HbA1c, the established measure of blood sugar levels over time. An extension and expansion of that trial with long term follow-up, the current results are based on data from 282 human study participants - 52 with type 1 diabetes who participated in the BCG clinical trials and 230 who contributed blood samples for mechanistic studies.

Regular monitoring of clinical trial participants found that HbA1c levels of those receiving BCG had dropped by more than 10 percent at three years after treatment and by more than 18 percent at four years. That reduction was maintained over the next four years, with treated participants having an average HbA1c of 6.65, close to the 6.5 considered the threshold for diabetes diagnosis, and with no reports of severe hypoglycemia. Participants in the placebo group and in a comparison group of patients receiving no treatment experienced consistent HbA1c elevations over the same eight-year time period.

In investigating how BCG administration produces its beneficial effects, the research team identified a mechanism never previously seen in humans in response to treatment with any drug - a shifting of the process of glucose metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation, the most common pathway by which cells convert glucose into energy, to aerobic glycolysis, a process that involves significantly greater glucose consumption by cells. The researchers also found that BCG could reduce blood sugar elevations in mice that were caused by means other than autoimmune attack, raising the possibility that BCG vaccines could also be beneficial against type 2 diabetes.

Mihai G. Netea, PhD, professor in the Department of Internal Medicine at Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands, says of this study, ""The clinical effects and the proposed mechanism demonstrated are exciting and add to the emerging consensus that the BCG vaccine can have a lasting and valuable impact on the immune system. We know, and this study shows, that BCG vaccination induces epigenetic reprogramming at the chromatin architecture level and functional alterations indicative of a permanent change in immunity. The MGH trials and other, larger prevention and intervention trials underway around the globe may lead to a major shift in the prevention and treatment of infections and autoimmunity."" Netea was not involved in the current study.

###

The MGH team's findings set the stage for further testing of BCG administration, including the FDA-approved phase 2 study currently underway, testing multiple BCG doses in a large group of participants with longstanding type 1 diabetes. That trial is fully enrolled, and there are seven additional BCG clinical trial groups currently recruiting or enrolling at MGH, with a pediatric trial in the planning stages.

"Wilmington, DE -- A Delaware team including Erin Crowgey, PhD, associate director of Bioinformatics with Nemours Biomedical Research, has published a study in the peer-reviewed journal BMC Bioinformatics, showing that DNA patterns in circulating blood cells can be used to help identify spastic cerebral palsy (CP) patients (Crowgey et al.).

The work represents a collaboration among researchers at Nemours, the University of Delaware (UD) and Genome Profiling LLC (GenPro for short). Co-authors of the paper include Robert Akins, PhD, the project principal investigator, who directs the Center for Pediatric Clinical Research and Development at Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children; UD molecular biologist Adam Marsh, PhD, who is chief science officer at GenPro; and Karyn Robinson, MS and Stephanie Yeager, MS, of Nemours Biomedical Research.

Early diagnosis supports early intervention

Cerebral palsy is a common yet understudied neurodevelopmental problem in the U.S. In fact, there is no national surveillance here, but the CDC estimates that 1 in 323 American children have the condition. CP is a group of disabilities with a wide spectrum of severity. Spastic CP, the most common type, is a lifelong condition characterized by joint stiffness, spasms, and muscle tightness that affects movement and posture and restricts the activity of affected children.

Although most children (85-90%) with cerebral palsy are born with it, diagnosis may be delayed until 2+ years of age. A diagnosis is made by monitoring motor milestones; infants thought to be at risk for CP are enrolled in early intervention programs where their progress is closely watched. New and better ways to identify infants with CP are needed so that interventions can start earlier for more children.

Nemours, internationally recognized for its CP center at Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, serves a diverse population of more than 3,000 children and young adults with CP, one of the largest programs in the U.S. Clinicians and researchers at Nemours continuously seek to improve the diagnosis and care of CP patients. Funding from the Swank Foundation enabled Nemours to develop a cerebral palsy tissue bank that stores blood and tissue samples from hundreds of surgical patients at Nemours.

In the study, the research team profiled blood samples collected in a blinded study from children and adolescents 9-19 years to explore whether patients with spastic CP showed differences at the cellular level that routine orthopedic patients (needing ACL repairs, spinal fusions or other surgeries) did not. The researchers identified a strong set of methylation markers, or patterns, that indicate differences in the genome between children with spastic CP and those without it. In a second study, using samples from children aged 2-5 years, the researchers were able to validate their results and predict with 73 percent accuracy whether the blood samples came from children who had CP.

""The evidence suggests that there is some epigenetic connection,"" said Crowgey. ""If we can do a better job of screening for these at time of birth versus waiting for the disorder to be diagnosed at 2 years of age, then potentially we'll be able to deliver earlier therapeutics and have better outcomes and lower medical costs."" Medicaid data show that annual medical costs for a child with CP are 10 to 26 times higher than for those without CP.

The power of data science, analytics and machine learning

The study leverages a unique statistical method and software platform originally developed by Dr. Marsh at UD and commercialized by GenPro to measure methylation patterns in DNA (a cell's genetic code) using next generation sequencing (NGS) data. NGS is a technique that enables scientists to decode DNA faster and more cheaply than traditional DNA sequencing methods. Each person's genome, or complete set of DNA, is like a word that's the length of 3 billion characters; but spelled with only the letters A, T, C or G. Traditional DNA sequencing techniques decode sections of DNA 700 characters at a time, while NGS takes advantage of parallel computing capabilities, enabling scientists to decode millions of DNA fragments. Subtle changes in a patient's physical health are paralleled by changes in DNA methylation, making it a useful tool to understand disease.

""Many of the signals that we pick up are based on immune system shifts--meaning the way a person's immune system responds to external stress events. When we find that epigenetic response, or signal, in the genetic sequencing, it provides another line of evidence for clinicians to use in making decisions,"" said Marsh.

The approach uses sophisticated machine learning techniques and algorithms to sort through hundreds of gigabytes of NGS data looking for these distinct DNA methylation patterns. ""The data set is massive. It's not something a human can do. You need infrastructure, machine learning, data analysis, and data science,"" said Crowgey.

Promising results, more testing needed

While the study findings indicate that there is a consistent signal present in circulating blood cells of children with spastic CP that remains from early childhood to the teenage years, the researchers say they need to further study samples from different age groups, including teenagers, toddlers, and infants from birth to 2 years. Learning more about methylation signals across ages will allow the approach to be further refined to identify cases and also could provide researchers new clues to understanding the cellular processes involved in advancing CP, and consequently, new therapeutics to manage the disease.

""We're still in the early phases, but the results are extremely promising and we're excited about the sensitivity of the test that we are seeing in our retrospective analysis,"" said Crowgey. If successful, the researchers say the type of blood test in development also may be useful for other disorders, such as infant leukemia.

Akins was optimistic. ""This is an example of the kind of innovation that can happen when people with different skill sets collaborate. The experimental testing went from idea to validated execution in less than 12 months. We're now working toward a goal of eventually forming a clinical diagnostic test and applying it to a broad population."" Akins added that Nemours is in a unique position for such an undertaking with its large CP population, its growing strength in data science and analytics, and its recent acquisition of newborn screening for the state of Delaware. ""Many issues will need to be addressed, but we predict routine screening for CP in the near (<10 years) future,"" he said.

"BOSTON (June 11, 2018) -- A new study conducted at the University of California, Davis found that two cups of mangos a day had beneficial effects on systolic blood pressure among healthy postmenopausal women. Mango consumption helped relax blood vessels in as little as two hours after intake. Additionally, some of the participants showed favorable changes in the production of breath methane, an indication of the potential influence on gut fermentation.

""This is the first study to demonstrate positive vascular effects of mango intake in humans,"" said lead researcher Robert Hackman, with the UC Davis Department of Nutrition. He presented the findings today at the American Society for Nutrition annual meeting, Nutrition 2018, in Boston. ""Our results build on previous animal and cell studies that point to the potential benefits of mangos to promote health.""

Mangos contain a mix of polyphenols, including mangiferin, quercetin, gallotannins, and gallic acid, that have been the focus of previous investigations exploring the potential health-protecting properties of mangos. Li and colleagues believe the concentration of these bioactive compounds in mangos may be responsible for the favorable response.

Methodology and Results

In the study, 24 healthy postmenopausal women consumed 330 grams (2 cups) of mango daily for 14 days. The honey mango (also referred to as Ataulfo) was chosen for the study due to the high concentration of polyphenols in this popular variety.

Following the 14 days of mango consumption, the study participants resumed their normal daily diet but eliminated mango intake for 13 days. Measurements were taken during each visit, including heart rate and blood pressure, blood samples and breath samples, which are increasingly used in nutrition studies to evaluate gut health status.

At the start of the study, blood pressure was not significantly different between the study visits. Yet once mango was consumed, systolic blood pressure was significantly lower two hours after mango intake compared to baseline values. Pulse pressure was also significantly reduced two hours after eating mango.

Systolic blood pressure (the upper number in blood pressure readings) indicates how much pressure your blood is exerting against your artery walls when the heart beats. Pulse pressure is the difference between systolic and diastolic (bottom number) in blood pressure readings. Pulse pressure can be used as an indicator of heart health.

Breath levels of hydrogen and methane were measured, which reflect the amount of these gases that were produced due to microbial fermentation in the intestinal tract. Some study participants produced hydrogen, some produced methane, and others produced both gases or neither of them. Six of the 24 participants produced methane, and of these six, three shown significant reduction after consuming mango, which is considered a favorable outcome for gut health.

The researchers conclude that mangos may be a heart-healthy fruit that may help play a role in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. Longer-term studies involving other population groups are warranted.

"(Philadelphia, PA) - Reversing memory deficits and impairments in spatial learning is a major goal in the field of dementia research. A lack of knowledge about cellular pathways critical to the development of dementia, however, has stood in the way of significant clinical advance. But now, researchers at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University (LKSOM) are breaking through that barrier. They show, for the first time in an animal model, that tau pathology - the second-most important lesion in the brain in patients with Alzheimer's disease - can be reversed by a drug.

""We show that we can intervene after disease is established and pharmacologically rescue mice that have tau-induced memory deficits,"" explained senior investigator Domenico Praticò, MD, Scott Richards North Star Foundation Chair for Alzheimer's Research, Professor in the Departments of Pharmacology and Microbiology, and Director of the Alzheimer's Center at Temple at LKSOM. The study, published online in the journal Molecular Neurobiology, raises new hope for human patients affected by dementia.

The researchers landed on their breakthrough after discovering that inflammatory molecules known as leukotrienes are deregulated in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. In experiments in animals, they found that the leukotriene pathway plays an especially important role in the later stages of disease.

""At the onset of dementia, leukotrienes attempt to protect nerve cells, but over the long term, they cause damage,"" Dr. Praticò said. ""Having discovered this, we wanted to know whether blocking leukotrienes could reverse the damage, whether we could do something to fix memory and learning impairments in mice having already abundant tau pathology.""

To recapitulate the clinical situation of dementia in humans, in which patients are already symptomatic by the time they are diagnosed, Dr. Praticò and colleagues used specially engineered tau transgenic mice, which develop tau pathology - characterized by neurofibrillary tangles, disrupted synapses (the junctions between neurons that allow them to communicate with one another), and declines in memory and learning ability - as they age. When the animals were 12 months old, the equivalent of age 60 in humans, they were treated with zileuton, a drug that inhibits leukotriene formation by blocking the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme.

After 16 weeks of treatment, animals were administered maze tests to assess their working memory and their spatial learning memory. Compared with untreated animals, tau mice that had received zileuton performed significantly better on the tests. Their superior performance suggested a successful reversal of memory deficiency.

To determine why this happened, the researchers first analyzed leukotriene levels. They found that treated tau mice experienced a 90-percent reduction in leukotrienes compared with untreated mice. In addition, levels of phosphorylated and insoluble tau, the form of the protein that is known to directly damage synapses, were 50 percent lower in treated animals. Microscopic examination revealed vast differences in synaptic integrity between the groups of mice. Whereas untreated animals had severe synaptic deterioration, the synapses of treated tau animals were indistinguishable from those of ordinary mice without the disease.

""Inflammation was completely gone from tau mice treated with the drug,"" Dr. Praticò said. ""The therapy shut down inflammatory processes in the brain, allowing the tau damage to be reversed.""

The study is especially exciting because zileuton is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of asthma. ""Leukotrienes are in the lungs and the brain, but we now know that in addition to their functional role in asthma, they also have a functional role in dementia,"" Dr. Praticò explained.

""This is an old drug for a new disease,"" he added. ""The research could soon be translated to the clinic, to human patients with Alzheimer's disease.""

"A new study authored by scientists from the American Cancer Society, the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, the U.S. National Cancer Institute, and more than 20 other medical centers and organizations finds that higher circulating vitamin D concentrations are significantly associated with lower colorectal cancer risk. This study strengthens the evidence, previously considered inconclusive, for a protective relationship. Optimal vitamin D concentrations for colorectal cancer prevention may be higher than the current National Academy of Medicine recommendations, which are based only on bone health. The study appears online in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.

Vitamin D, known for its role in maintaining bone health, is hypothesized to lower colorectal cancer risk via several pathways related to cell growth and regulation. Previous prospective studies have reported inconsistent results for whether higher concentrations of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D, the accepted measure of vitamin D status, are linked to lower risk of colorectal cancer. The few randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation and colorectal cancer completed thus far have not shown an effect; but study size, supplementation duration, and compliance may have contributed to their null findings.

""To address inconsistencies in prior studies on vitamin D and to investigate associations in population subgroups, we analyzed participant-level data, collected before colorectal cancer diagnosis, from 17 prospective cohorts and used standardized criteria across the studies,"" said Stephanie Smith-Warner, PhD, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and co-senior author on the article. The analysis included over 5,700 colorectal cancer cases and 7,100 controls from the United States, Europe, and Asia. A single, widely accepted assay and laboratory was used for new vitamin D measurements and calibration of existing vitamin D measurements. ""In the past, substantial differences between assays made it difficult to integrate vitamin D data from different studies,"" explained Regina G. Ziegler, PhD, a National Cancer Institute epidemiologist and co-senior author on the article. ""This calibration approach enabled us to systematically explore risk over the broad range of vitamin D levels seen internationally.""

Compared to participants with circulating vitamin D concentrations considered sufficient for bone health, those with deficient concentrations of vitamin D had a 31% higher risk of colorectal cancer during follow-up, which averaged 5.5 years (range: 1 - 25 years). Similarly, concentrations above bone health sufficiency were associated with a 22% lower risk. However, risk did not continue to decline at the highest concentrations. These associations persisted even after adjusting for known colorectal cancer risk factors. Protective associations were seen in all subgroups examined. However, the association was noticeably stronger in women than men at concentrations above bone health sufficiency. The lifetime risk of colorectal cancer is 4.2% (1 in 24) in women and 4.5% (1 in 22) in men. Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in both men and women in the United States, with about 140,250 new cases and 50,630 deaths expected during 2018.

""Currently, health agencies do not recommend vitamin D for the prevention of colorectal cancer,"" said Marji L. McCullough, ScD, American Cancer Society epidemiologist and co-first author of the study. ""This study adds new information that agencies can use when reviewing evidence for vitamin D guidance and suggests that the concentrations recommended for bone health may be lower than would be optimal for colorectal cancer prevention.""

Vitamin D can be obtained in the diet, particularly from fortified foods, from supplements, and from sun exposure. Experts recommend vitamin D be obtained through diet whenever possible because excessive ultraviolet radiation is a major risk factor for skin cancer.

"(Reuters Health) - Waning eyesight may hasten the pace of cognitive decline in older people, suggests a U.S. study.

The results suggest that vision fixes, like a new eyeglass prescription or surgery to remove cataracts, can go a long way toward helping older people stay mentally sharp, said lead author D. Diane Zheng of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.

“Taking care of your vision is important in order to maintain good cognitive function,” she said in a telephone interview.

Poor eyesight and weakening mental function are common in older people and related to one another, but the question of whether vision influences cognition, or vice versa, has not been clear, the study team writes in JAMA Ophthalmology.

To investigate, Zheng’s team followed 2,520 adults for eight years, testing their vision and cognitive status every other year.

Over the course of the study, average visual decline was roughly equivalent to losing the ability to read one line of an eye chart. People who had worse vision at the beginning of the study had worse scores on the cognitive exam as well. A person’s vision at their previous check-up was related to their mental function at the following check-up. While mental function at one check-up was also related to vision at the following exam, the effect of vision on subsequent mental function was significantly stronger.

While the mechanism behind the vision-cognition relationship isn’t well understood, Zheng said, worsening vision can discourage people from brain-stimulating activities like doing crosswords and engaging with other people.

She recommended that older adults get regular eye checkups, and have any vision symptoms checked out and treated promptly.

“This study provides additional evidence that would suggest that people who can keep their vision healthy as they age might also be protecting their cognitive health,” said Dr. Heather E. Whitson of Duke University School of Medicine and Durham VA Medical Center, who wasn’t involved in the research.

“If you’re aging without good vision, not only are you giving your brain less stimulation, you might be altering your brain at a structural level,” she said in a phone interview.

The good news, Whitson added, is that poor vision is one of the few risk factors for cognitive decline that is potentially modifiable. Even incurable causes of age-related vision loss such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration “are highly treatable, so we can reduce the amount of vision loss that people suffer from if they’re detected early.”

"Results are published in the scientific publication the Journal of Medical Cases, and is authored by USRM Chief Science Officer Dr. Kristin Comella and colleagues Dr. Scott Greenberg of the Magaziner Center for Wellness, and Dr. Laura Ross of Ross Orthopedic.

""The ability to provide this kind of therapy to Americans can be life changing,"" said Dr. Comella. ""Use of one's own healing cells to help repair damaged tissue rather than having to cut open or manipulate the damaged area to try to reduce pain and restore function is the most elegant form of regenerative medicine we have today.""

Meniscal injuries are the most common knee injury in the United States with an annual average of incidence of 66 per 100,000, according to a 2014 article in the Journal of Orthopedics. Approximately 850,000 patients each year are surgically treated -- often arthroscopically -- for meniscal injuries.

The paper outlines the case study of a 56-year-old male with a chronic meniscus injury. During the 12-month follow-up period, the patient reported a reduction in pain and an improvement in knee function. Figure 1a shows a tear at baseline on the posterior horn of the medial meniscus, while Figure 1b, taken 9 months after the first injection shows complete resolution of the tear. The healed tear could not be penetrated by the probe.

The arthroscopic images showing resolution were also consistent with quality of life improvements for the patient, including a reduction in pain and resumption of normal activities. The patient experienced very little downtime and was able to resume normal activities in less than 1 week.

Dr. Comella, who has more than 20+ years' experience, is recognized worldwide by her peers as an innovator and world leader in the development and clinical practice of stem cell products and therapies. USRM has been a part of more than 10,000 stem cell procedures in the past 19 years for a variety of indications including orthopedic, autoimmune, degenerative and neurological diseases.

"A Simple Emergency Room Intervention Can Help Cut Suicide Risk

Enlarge this image toggle caption FangXiaNuo/Getty Images FangXiaNuo/Getty Images

Many people who attempt suicide end up in an emergency room for immediate treatment. But few of those suicide survivors get the follow-up care they need at a time when they are especially likely to attempt suicide again.

Now, a study shows that a simple intervention conducted by staff in emergency departments can reduce the risk of future attempts. The intervention involves creating a safety plan for each patient and following up with phone calls after discharge.

""It reduced the odds of suicidal behavior by half,"" says Barbara Stanley, a psychologist at Columbia University and the lead author of the study. ""That's a phenomenal difference.""

The study, which was published Wednesday in JAMA Psychiatry, included 1,200 patients at five Veterans Affairs hospitals around the country. The findings offer a way for hospitals and clinics to help reduce the rising numbers of death by suicide across the country.

You Are Not Alone If you or someone you know may be considering suicide, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (en Español: 1-888-628-9454; deaf and hard of hearing: 1-800-799-4889) or the Crisis Text Line by texting 741741.

""When someone goes to the emergency room for a suicide attempt, they are at risk of another suicide attempt for the next three months,"" says Stanley. ""It's like a ticking time bomb.""

This is the first large-scale study of the Safety Planning Intervention, which Stanley and her group developed in 2008 and which has been adopted at hospitals and clinics around the country. It can be provided by a physician, a nurse or a social worker and requires very little training.

""The interesting thing about the Safety Planning Intervention is that it is a relatively brief intervention and can be used in a lot of different [health care] settings,"" says Brian Ahmedani, director of behavioral health research at the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, who wasn't involved in the new study.

Many health care systems are starting to think about ways to prevent suicide, he says. That's because, as his own work has shown, almost 83 percent of people who die by suicide make a health care visit in the year before their death. Yet only 50 percent of those people have been diagnosed with a mental illness.

The intervention studied by Stanley and her group starts in the ER or a clinic, before the suicidal patient is released. First, a health care professional talks with the patient and tries to understand that person's warning signs for a suicide attempt.

""If they've grappled with being suicidal, they know what their warning signs are,"" says Stanley. For example, she says, someone might say, "" 'I find that I'm staying in my room, not answering the phone, not answering texts, not answering emails.' That could be a warning sign."" Others might have repeated thoughts that they're not worthy.

The next step is for the patient — with help from the clinician — to come up with a set of coping strategies to help get through moments of intense suicidal ideation.

For most people, this intense state only lasts from a few minutes to a couple of hours, she says.

The coping strategy could be something as simple as playing video games, watching TV or talking to a loved one.

If people contemplating suicide can distract themselves with something they enjoy doing, they can bypass that narrow window during which suicidal thoughts can overpower them, notes Stanley. ""For suicidal people, the passage of time is their friend,"" she says.

The provider also tries to persuade patients to remove or distance themselves from their means of suicide. For example, if they own a gun, they should lock it away or give it to someone who can keep it away from them. ""If you make it really hard to use whatever means you were going to use, time passes and you give a chance for suicidal thoughts to subside,"" she says.

Safety planning includes follow-up phone calls with the patient — the first call is made within 72 hours of being discharged from the ER. The provider asks the patient how the safety plan is being used and helps revise it if needed. The provider also makes sure the patient sees a mental health care provider for long-term care. A provider keeps calling until the patient has had a second appointment with a therapist or counselor.

That follow-up is key, says Julie Goldstein Grumet, a psychologist at the Zero Suicide Institute at the Education Development Center, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit.

""People often fall off and they don't follow up on their referrals,"" she says. ""And the times during these transitions from acute care settings is one of the highest risk times of suicides.""

To evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention, Stanley's team looked at five VA emergency departments across the country that used it and compared the outcomes with four VA emergency rooms that simply discharge patients after stabilizing them.

Among the nearly 1,200 people who received the intervention, half as many people had made suicide attempts (or had come very close) as those in the control group. In other words, the intervention had nearly halved the risk of suicide in the six months after discharge. Two-thirds of the people in the treatment group had used their safety plans, and they were also twice as likely to get follow-up mental health treatment when compared with the control group.

""The study is incredibly important ... because it shows brief interventions work,"" says Goldstein Grumet.

Rick, a father in Missouri, says a safety plan may have saved his 12-year-old daughter's life. (NPR is leaving off his last name to protect his daughter's privacy.)

In September 2017, she came very close to taking her own life. When he found out about this from her school principal the next day, Rick rushed her to the ER at Mercy Hospital Jefferson. ""The whole process was overwhelming, because you have your 12-year-old who's wanting to end her life,"" Rick says. ""And she'd not shared any of that with us.""

The hospital wasn't part of the new study but was also using a safety planning intervention as part of its efforts to prevent suicides.

""The crisis counselor did such an amazing job of setting up a safety plan that my daughter felt comfortable with,"" he says.

He says his daughter didn't want to talk to him or her mother about her struggles, but she agreed to communicate with them in other ways. During times when she felt her urge to take her own life coming back, she agreed to watch TV with her mother or call or text her father.

Rick says she usually sends a specific emoji when she is having a bad day. And he responds by distracting her with something completely different.

He says she also agreed to use a crisis help line if things escalated.

""It was something that she could follow through with,"" he says. ""It gave her some confidence and it gave me some confidence.""

He says the plan has helped his daughter get through her suicidal phase and even slowly open up to her parents.

""That's what is so powerful about a safety plan,"" says Ahmedani. ""The patient is the author of their safety plan, but it's guided by a provider.""

As part of the 2012 National Strategy For Suicide Prevention, many health care providers have adopted the approaches to prevention outlined in the Zero Suicide Initiative, which includes safety planning based on previous evidence showing it works.

While safety planning has begun to be used across the country, it ought to be adopted universally, says Goldstein Grumet.

""It is a brief intervention that hospital workers, primary care staff, outpatient behavioral health, can all be trained in to utilize,"" she says."	A Simple Emergency Room Intervention Can Help Cut Suicide Risk	2018-07-11 06:00:00	https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/07/11/628029412/a-simple-emergency-room-intervention-can-help-cut-future-suicide-risk	story_reviews_00051	true
"During a traumatic divorce, Ronni Shapiro of Westhampton Beach, N.Y., became severely depressed and suicidal. Psychiatrists put her on different antidepressants that only aggravated her situation.

“Within three months, I was on 10 different medications,” Shapiro, 61, said. “It was horrible.”

Eventually, she learned about GeneSight, a new type of genetic testing by Myriad Genetics, meant to help avoid the painful trial-and-error process many depression patients endure in the search for the right medicine. After a simple cheek swab, her results showed that pretty much everything she had previously tried was in the “significant gene interaction” category, meaning that based on her genetic makeup, these medicines would adversely affect her or prove ineffective at normal doses.

Guided by her results, her doctor thought that Wellbutrin would be a more promising option. And though the test is better at saying what won’t work than what will, her doctor’s decision proved the right one.

“I can’t tell you that I am footloose and fancy-free,” Shapiro said. “I still suffer. But when I fall into those dark holes, there’s like a ladder that I can see to climb up, as opposed to feeling helpless.”

As many as two-thirds of people with depression aren’t helped by the first antidepressant they try, leaving many to spend months after they are diagnosed without real help.

In May, Myriad Genetics released the first large-scale test of whether treatment guided by genetics (pharmacogenomics) would improve overall outcomes for patients with major depression. The study found that patients were 30 percent more likely to respond to treatment when their medication selection was guided by the company’s GeneSight test. The test uses a proprietary algorithm to analyze 12 different genes to weigh their combined influence on patient response to more than 55 psychotropic drugs. The patient’s color-coded report would read: “Use as directed” in green, “moderate gene-drug interaction” in yellow, and “significant gene interaction” in red.

Now, another company, Genomind in King of Prussia, is offering free education about its genetic test, Genecept Assay, at Sav-On pharmacies in two Philadelphia-area Acme Markets.

Specially trained pharmacists may decide to counsel patients about the Genecept test if they see a pattern of unsuccessful treatment with medicine for depression, anxiety, and/or obsessive-compulsive disorder.

No magic solution

But while genetic testing offers tools to better guide patients’ treatment, it cannot tell doctors exactly which medicines will work – or necessarily provide the key to enduring remission from depression.

Vincent Sparks of Mullica Hill has benefited from genetic testing, but his mental health issues have persisted. Having battled anxiety and depression most of his life, Sparks, 60, was happy to find a genetic test to help his psychiatrist better direct his treatment. After taking the Genecept test, he discovered that a combination of Prozac and Lamictal was a better genetic fit for him than previous medications. But Sparks continues to struggle.

“I have times where I’m fairly level for a while, but at times it seems like I’m on a roller coaster,” Sparks said. “Sometimes I wish I could just take out my brain and wash it. If I could just put it through the rinse cycle, things would be better.”

Though imperfect, the Genecept test has been shown in peer-reviewed published studies to improve patient outcomes and reduce overall medical costs. “In medicine in general, this will be standard of care at some point,” said Dan Dowd, Genomind vice president. “Twenty years from now, everyone will have some kind of pharmacological genetic test as part of their health record.”

GeneSight’s test is covered by Medicare for patients under the care of psychiatrists and who have failed to achieve satisfactory results with at least one antidepressant. The company has coverage with some commercial payers and is working to widen that coverage, said Myriad Genetics spokesman Ron Rogers. The Genomind Genecept Assay is covered by Medicare and Medicaid. If the out-of-pocket cost for people with commercial plans is more than $300, Genomind will contact the client before processing the test. The company also has a financial assistance program for uninsured patients.

“This is the beginning of personalized precision treatment,” said John Greden of the University of Michigan, primary investigator of the GeneSight study. “One-size treatment will never fit all, and we’re finally getting the tools, not just to say that but to act on it.”

‘Knowledge is a good thing’

Michael Thase, a psychiatry professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine and director of Penn’s Mood and Anxiety program, was another author of the GeneSight study. He stressed that although the test does not tell you exactly what will work, it can indicate a host of medications that will be ineffective.

“I think knowledge is a good thing, and having knowledge in improving the care of your patient is a good thing,” Thase said.

John O’Reardon, a Voorhees psychiatrist who treats patients with treatment-resistant depression and employs a form of neuromodulation called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), said that based on the results of the GeneSight study, he may start using this genetic test in his practice.

“The absolute numbers for response [26 percent] and remission [15.3 percent] don’t seem that high, but unfortunately that is what you get with increasing treatment resistance,” O’Reardon said about the GeneSight study. He was more impressed with the results patients experienced a half- year out. “By six months, the response rate was up to 50 percent and the remission rate was about 40 percent, which are excellent results,” he said.

For Marina Goldman, a Jenkintown psychiatrist in private practice, the GeneSight study was “interesting but really beside the point.”

Generally, she thinks that TMS and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), with their high success rates – approximately 75 percent to 83 percent for ECT and approximately 65 percent for TMS – offer more effective solutions for patients who have failed to respond to three or more antidepressants. At the same time, Goldman presents genetic testing as an option to patients with treatment-resistant depression who are wary about trying TMS or ECT.

“There’s a big debate right now in the psychiatric literature, and what they’re writing editorials about is that we’re waiting too long to refer patients out for neuromodulation,” Goldman said. “With the genetic testing, the chance of getting a response is about 20 percent. Why not move to ECT, where the chance is about 50 percent for treatment-resistant patients?”"	Which antidepressant is right for you?

"Worried About Dementia? You Might Want to Check Your Blood Pressure

Enlarge this image toggle caption John Rensten/Getty Images John Rensten/Getty Images

Every day, Dr. Walter Koroshetz, 65, takes a pill as part of his effort to help keep his brain healthy and sharp.

The pill is his blood pressure medication. And Koroshetz, who directs the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, says controlling high blood pressure helps him reduce his risk of dementia.

He also keeps his blood pressure down by exercising and paying attention to his weight and diet. ""I'm a believer,"" he says.

Koroshetz is urging other people with high blood pressure to follow his lead.

He is responsible for the institute's public health campaign called Mind Your Risks. Its goal is to let people know that there is a link between high blood pressure, stroke and dementia.

When blood pressure rises, it strains the tiny blood vessels that keep brain cells alive, Koroshetz says.

""With every pulse of your heart, you are pushing blood into these very small blood vessels in the brain,"" he says. And when the heart pushes too hard, as it does when blood pressure is elevated, it can cause damage that can lead to a stroke.

At least two large studies have revealed an alarming trend among stroke patients, Koroshetz says.

""If you had a stroke, even a small stroke, your risk of dementia within the next two years was greatly magnified,"" he says. ""So there's something about having a stroke that drives a lot of the processes that give rise to dementia.""

The evidence is clearest for a type of dementia called vascular dementia. It occurs when something blocks or reduces the flow of blood to brain cells.

But high blood pressure also appears to increase a person's risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, which is associated with the accumulation of plaques and tangles in the brain.

If people knew about the link between dementia and high blood pressure, they might be more inclined to do something about it, Koroshetz says.

""Only about 50 percent of people who have hypertension are actually treated,"" he says. ""So I think there's a lot to be said for trying to get high blood pressure under control.""

Koroshetz's campaign is getting some help from the Alzheimer's Association.

The group will present new research on blood pressure and Alzheimer's at its annual scientific meeting in Chicago, which starts July 22. And the group is encouraging people to control high blood pressure.

""The good news is that we can control blood pressure now,"" says Maria Carrillo, the group's chief science officer. ""We can do that with exercise, with lifestyle, with healthy eating and also with medications.""

Koroshetz is using all of these approaches. And he says other people with high blood pressure should follow his lead.

""When you get to be my age, you're going to be very grateful that you controlled your blood pressure and exercised,"" he says."	Worried About Dementia?

"(CNN) Australian researchers have developed an experimental blood test they say is the first blood test capable of detecting melanoma -- an aggressive form of skin cancer -- in its early stages with a high degree of accuracy.

The test could speed up the diagnosis process, saving thousands of lives.

Scientists at Edith Cowan University in Western Australia tested blood samples for the antibodies typically created by the immune system in response to melanoma and identified them with significant accuracy.

Antibodies ""are easily accessible in the blood, so it provides a fantastic test to identify an early-stage cancer,"" said project lead Professor Mel Ziman, leader of the university's Melanoma Research Group on Monday.

In the study , published Tuesday in the journal Oncotarget, Ziman's team screened 245 blood samples from both melanoma patients and healthy volunteers. The researchers were able to identify people with melanoma with 79% accuracy and people without a melanoma with 84% accuracy.

""In order for it to be valued by clinicians we would need to get to 90% accuracy in detection,"" she said. ""So we are doing a clinical trial with 1000 participants to refine our test to get to this point.""

If further trials are successful, Ziman estimates the test could be distributed internationally in up to five years.

Patients who returned a positive result would still need a biopsy to confirm the blood test and determine how far the cancer had developed, Ziman said.

Multiple groups worldwide are working to develop blood tests that detect a range of cancers. A recent study showed promise for a test detecting tumors of the ovary, liver, stomach, pancreas, esophagus, colorectum, lung and breast, while another study claimed to detect 10 cancers, including 90% accuracy for ovarian cancer.

The Australian team believe theirs would be the first to detect melanoma.

'In the wrong place with the wrong skin color'

Melanoma cancers are dangerous, abnormal growths on the surface of the skin caused by sun damage, which can spread throughout the body if left untreated.

A melanoma skin cancer.

The problem is particularly serious in Australia, where melanomas were the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer in 2017 and cause about 1,700 deaths a year, according to the university.

This is in large part due to high levels of UV exposure caused by the region's proximity to the ozone hole over the Antarctic.

""We're in the wrong place with the wrong skin color. We've had a lot of migrants from European nations, so they're fair-skinned ... and we do have a very intense sun here,"" Ziman said.

If detected early, skin cancers have a survival rate as high as 95%, the research team said, but it drops to just 50% if diagnosed late.

Surgery to remove the growth is the most common form of treatment.

Simpler detection

Ziman said current methods of melanoma detection are expensive and invasive, involving a trip to a clinician, who must biopsy the lesion to discover whether it is cancerous.

For potential sufferers in remote areas, away from skin specialists, diagnosis can be especially tricky, he said, making a simple blood test an easy alternative to identify those at risk.

Over three years, the research team identified a combination of 10 types of antibodies that best signal the presence of a melanoma.

Antibodies are the products of the body's immune system, created to battle not only bacteria and viruses but abnormal cancer cells, Ziman said.

Dr. Jodie Moffat, head of early diagnosis at Cancer Research UK, agreed that a test which finds melanoma earlier could help reduce deaths from the disease, adding that ""melanoma can be more than skin deep, and it's much harder to treat when diagnosed at a late stage after it has spread.""

However, she stressed the fact this new test has not undergone clinical trials.

""We need to know how accurate it is, if it can save lives, and how it could work in practice. So, although a blood test to find skin cancer earlier is certainly exciting, research in this field still has hurdles to overcome,"" she said.

In the meantime, ""people can help spot skin cancer early by knowing what's normal for their skin,"" said Moffat. In turn people should talk to a health professional about any ""unusual or lasting changes to a mole, freckle or normal patch of skin."""

TUESDAY, July 24, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The active ingredient in pot that gets you high can calm agitation in people with advanced Alzheimer's disease, a small new study suggests.

Canadian researchers found that a form of synthetic THC significantly decreased agitation in a small group of Alzheimer's patients, working even better than the drugs now used.

""This is the first clinical trial to show that a cannabinoid can decrease agitation,"" said lead researcher Krista Lanctot, a senior scientist at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center in Toronto.

However, many study patients suffered from sedation due to the drug, noted Keith Fargo, director of scientific programs and outreach at the Alzheimer's Association.

""We would love to see this study done in a larger group of people, to see if it continues to be effective in a larger group, and how worried we need to be about this sedation side effect,"" Fargo said.

Agitation is a frequent symptom of advanced Alzheimer's, Lanctot explained. Doctors struggle to control it through off-label use of drugs like antipsychotics and anticonvulsants.

Agitated patients yell, scream, pace and wander, she said. They also can become physically aggressive, striking out at people and hurting themselves or others.

""You're going to find one in five outpatients with it. But when you get to the long-term care facilities, about 50 percent of inpatients will have agitation,"" Lanctot said. ""It's actually a big treatment challenge. The drugs we have now do not work very well and they're associated with an increase in mortality.""

The off-label drugs used to treat Alzheimer's are indeed a bit dodgy. For example, only one person out of five to 14 treated with antipsychotics actually experiences a decrease in agitation, Lanctot said. And for every nine to 25 people helped, one will die.

But Lanctot and her colleagues suspected that cannabinoids might help control agitation, given that natural cannabinoids in the brain decrease as Alzheimer's enters its advanced stages.

""We know cannabis has several effects that might be good for people with agitation,"" Lanctot said. ""It has a calming effect. It helps with weight loss because it helps with appetite. It's also used for pain.""

The synthetic THC drug, nabilone, is approved in Canada for treating nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy. It comes in capsule form.

""It's a milder form of TCH"" compared to whole-leaf marijuana, Lanctot said. ""We hoped it wouldn't have the side effects associated with cannabis, but would have the calming effects.""

During the clinical trial, 39 patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease received nabilone for six weeks to treat their clinically significant agitation, followed by six weeks with an inactive placebo.

""We had a significant decrease in agitation. The decrease we saw was larger than is seen with the currently used medications,"" Lanctot said.

Patients underwent significant overall improvement in their other behavioral symptoms, and had small benefits in their brain function and nutrition during the study. Their caregivers also reported reduced levels of stress, according to Lanctot.

These benefits came with a downside, though. About 45 percent of patients experienced sedation with nabilone, compared with 16 percent for placebo, the findings showed.

Lanctot and Fargo do not recommend that relatives or friends of those with agitated Alzheimer's provide them medical marijuana to ease their suffering.

""This trial tested a synthetic analog of THC. It's not THC, and it's certainly not whole-plant marijuana,"" Fargo said. ""There's virtually no data on whole-plant marijuana, whether or not it's effective or safe in people with Alzheimer's disease.""

A form of synthetic THC is available in the United States, called dronabinol and sold under the trade name Marinol, Lanctot said. It's used as an appetite stimulant for people with AIDS and an anti-nausea remedy for chemotherapy patients.

Marinol is now being tested for its usefulness in treating Alzheimer's symptoms, Lanctot said. People interested in trying it should reach out to one of the big clinical trials; Johns Hopkins is one of the centers testing Marinol.

""We wouldn't want to change clinical practice based on one study,"" Lanctot added.

The study was to be presented Tuesday at the Alzheimer's Association meeting in Chicago. Research presented at medical meetings is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

"When actress and author Lena Dunham went public about having endometriosis, a disorder of the uterus, she wanted to make something clear: The pain it causes can be completely debilitating, and women desperately need better treatments.

Soon, it seems, women like Dunham who suffer from endometriosis pain will have a new option for relief. An effective treatment was just approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and it’s expected to arrive at pharmacies as soon as August. The pill, called elagolix (brand name Orilissa) from the drugmaker AbbVie, is the first FDA-approved oral treatment in more than a decade for the moderate to severe pain that comes with endometriosis.

“This [medication] could really be transformative,” said Hugh Taylor, an OB-GYN doctor at Yale Medical School who led the key trials testing the drug. “I’m very excited to be able to start using it in my patients.”

Endometriosis is one of the most common gynecological conditions, affecting one in 10 women of reproductive age. And it can be incredibly painful. The reason is simple: Women with the condition are growing excess tissue in their abdomen that they can’t shed.

Every month, a woman’s uterine lining thickens and sheds during her period if she’s not pregnant. With endometriosis, that tissue thickens and bleeds, but it happens outside of the uterus — on the fallopian tubes, even in the nose, the lungs. Because the extra tissue has no way to exit the body (it can’t go through the vagina since it’s not growing in the uterus) it builds up and becomes trapped, leading to pain and, in some cases, infertility.

There’s no cure for endometriosis. To manage symptoms, women are usually prescribed birth control or over-the-counter painkillers as a first-line approach, but they don’t always work. In severe cases, a doctor may suggest surgery to remove the extra tissue. (Dunham had eight surgeries, and ended up getting a hysterectomy, which was considered an extreme measure.)

Enter elagolix. Endometriosis is an estrogen-driven disease, and the drug works by lowering estrogen levels. Two large double-blind, placebo-control randomized trials, involving 1,200 women, tested whether it can help women control endometriosis pain.

The results, published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine, were pretty remarkable. The patients in those trials scored their pain from 0 (no pain) to 3 (severe pain). On average, they had pain levels of 2.2 out of 3 before starting on the drug — and they experienced a 2-point reduction in pain after taking the treatment for three months.

“It’s a major advance,” said Dr. Louis DePaolo, head of the fertility and infertility branch at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, “and another option women have that’s effective.”

Now, the less good news: The drug won’t cure endometriosis — it’ll only tamp down the pain it causes. Researchers have also found it causes bone loss, and they have no idea about the long-term effects of taking the drug because there are no trials lasting for longer than a year. It’ll also cost women $850 per month if they don’t have insurance coverage. But for some, the risks and costs may be worth it. Here’s why.

Endometriosis is incredibly common — but it can go undiagnosed for years

The three main ways endometriosis manifests are through pelvic pain, infertility, and pelvic masses such as cysts, scar tissue, and fibroids. According to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, some important signs of endometriosis include:

Pain before and during periods

Pain during sex

Infertility

Fatigue

Painful urination during periods

Painful bowel movements during periods

But many women don’t know they have endometriosis. It’s sometimes mistaken or dismissed for regular period pain. Definitively diagnosing the disorder requires invasive surgery; doctors need to peer inside the pelvis through a laparoscopy. (Imaging is rarely helpful in getting a clear diagnosis.) This involves making a small incision in the belly and inserting a tube with a tiny camera to see if the pelvic organs show signs of tissue scarring and buildup. So it’s no surprise it takes between three and 11 years after the onset of symptoms to diagnose endometriosis.

Doctors aren’t sure why some women get it

Adding to the mystery around endometriosis: no one knows exactly what causes endometriosis, but doctors have some theories.

Retrograde menstrual flow: During a period, when a woman is shedding her uterine lining, some of that tissue can flow through her fallopian tubes and into her pelvis, which researchers think may cause endometriosis. But doctors have also found that the rate of retrograde menstruation is about the same in women with and without endometriosis, so they think additional factors spur the disorder in some.

But doctors have also found that the rate of retrograde menstruation is about the same in women with and without endometriosis, so they think additional factors spur the disorder in some. Genes: The disorder runs in families, so doctors believe there’s a genetic component. If a woman’s mom or sister had endometriosis, she’s believed to be at a higher risk.

Immune system dysfunction: Problems with the immune system can hamper a woman’s ability to clear her menstrual debris, leading to endometriosis.

Problems with the immune system can hamper a woman’s ability to clear her menstrual debris, leading to endometriosis. Environmental factors: There’s some evidence to suggest environmental exposures to certain chemicals may contribute to one’s risk of developing endometriosis.

The treatments available don’t always help — and some have severe side effects

When birth control pills or over-the-counter painkillers fail to help endometriosis pain, women are often left choosing between a monthly injection called Lupron Depot, that can put women into a profoundly menopausal state, or a Danazol, a male hormone that often causes acne and facial hair growth.

The new drug elagolix is not risk free, either. In the trials, women who took the drug had greater decreases in bone loss than did those who received placebo, and this wasn’t entirely surprising.

Like other endometriosis treatments, the drug works by lowering estrogen levels. When that happens, women experience menopausal side effects. The most common in the trials were hot flushes, headaches, and insomnia. (Elagolix is available in two doses — 150 mg per day, or 200 mg twice daily — and the women on the higher dose experienced the side effects more frequently.)

But, DePaolo pointed out, “[Elagolix] doesn’t have the pronounced side effects some of the other compounds have.” That’s because, he said, it doesn’t drive down estrogen levels as severely.

So women with endometriosis are still left choosing between terrible pain or menopausal symptoms, including bone loss. “The game changer would be something that really improves the pain permanently,” DePaolo said. “This doesn’t do that — but it is effective while it’s given.” For some women, though, that may be a game changer in and of itself."

There’s finally a new treatment.	2018-07-24 06:00:00	https://web.archive.org/web/20180725003604/https://www.vox.com/2018/7/24/17608984/endometriosis-pain-symptoms-treatments-elagolix-orilissa	story_reviews_00047	true
"Every year in Europe, three million people are admitted into hospitals for suspected mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) cases. Yet 90% of these patients will be able to return home safely, as no trauma has been detected. Today, the only reliable diagnosis is the CT Scan, which is only available in some hospitals and, in addition to being expensive, exposes patients to radiations. Researchers from the University of Geneva (UNIGE), in collaboration with the Hospitals of Barcelona, Madrid and Seville, have developed a small device - Point-of-Care Test (POCT) - that analyses the level of proteins in the blood and allows, using a single drop of blood, to diagnose the possibility of a mild traumatic brain injury. This discovery, described in PLOS ONE, will not only relieve emergency departments, free patients from often long waits, but also save on costly medical examinations.

Falling whilst skiing, tumbling down the stairs or getting hit on the head can cause symptoms such as blurred vision, vomiting, loss of consciousness or memory for about 30 minutes. There is then a risk of mild cerebral trauma, which represents more than 90% of brain injuries admitted to hospitals. But is there really a brain lesion? Or are these symptoms merely the consequence of the violence of the shock, of which will ultimately only leave a bump behind?

Today, the injured patients have to go to the emergency rooms of hospitals equipped with a CT Scan, an expensive examination that sends X-rays to the brain to detect the presence or absence of brain trauma. As their case is not a priority, it often takes a long time for the majority of patients to return home without risk of sequelae, except for bad memories.

Find biomarkers for light traumas

""We wondered if it was possible to isolate certain proteins whose presence in the blood increases in the event of mild traumatic brain injury,» explains Jean-Charles Sanchez, professor at the Department of Internal Medicine of Specialties and the Biomarkers Centre of the Faculty of Medicine of the UNIGE. ""Our idea was to find a way to do a quick examination that would allow, during a boxing or American football match for example, to determine whether the athlete can return to the field or if his condition requires hospitalization. The opposite of the CT Scan, an exam that lasts a long time and cannot be done anywhere,"" he adds.

During a shock on the head, some brain cells are damaged and release the proteins they contain, increasing their level in the blood. Scientists at UNIGE and Spanish hospitals then compared the blood of patients admitted for mild traumatic brain injury but diagnosed as negative with that of patients actually suffering from a brain lesion. Using proteomic analyses, which can quantify thousands of proteins simultaneously and observe variations in their levels in the blood, they gradually isolated four molecules indicating the presence of a brain injury: H-FABP, Interleukin-10, S100B and GFAP. ""We have noticed that the H-FABP level alone makes it possible to confirm that there is no risk of trauma in one third of patients admitted after a shock,"" enthuses Jean-Charles Sanchez. The rest of the patients will have to undergo a CT scan to confirm the diagnosis.

TBIcheck, the light brain trauma detector

It was still necessary to develop a device that could be used everywhere, quickly and simply, and that could be available in pharmacies or sports halls. ""When a person has an accident in the mountain, few practices can do a CT Scan,"" notes the Geneva researcher. His team has developed a rapid diagnostic test (POCT) called TBIcheck, inspired by the principle of pregnancy testing: by placing a single drop of blood on the well of a small 5cm plastic case, the patient knows within 10 minutes whether there is a risk of mild trauma, namely whether or not his H-FABP level is higher than 2.5 nanograms per millilitre of blood. ""If a lane appears, the injured person must go to a hospital for a CT scan, if there is nothing, he can go home safely!"" Jean-Charles Sanchez says. In case of doubt when reading the result, a small reader, the Cube Reader, can be installed on TBIcheck. It will display the word ""positive"" or ""negative"" and send the result to the patient's or caregiver's smartphone via Bluetooth. No more doubts!

Commercialization planned for beginning 2019

These results, patented by UNIGE and awarded the Prix de l'Innovation Academy in December 2017, will be marketed from 2019 by ABCDx, a start-up founded four years ago by Jean-Charles Sanchez of UNIGE and Joan Montaner of Vall d'Hebron Hospital in Barcelona, co-authors of this study. ""Today, our research shows that the results are even more accurate when we combine H-FABP and GFAP levels,"" continues Jean-Charles Sanchez. ""We are currently preparing an even more effective TBIcheck, which will allow 50% of patients to be sent home, but which requires an increase in the sensitivity of the test that receives the blood."" ABCDx's ultimate goal is to bring to market biomarkers capable of diagnosing brain trauma, stroke and aneurysms. ""Biomarkers are a mine of information on patients' state of health, it is up to us to decode them,"" concludes the Geneva researcher.

"San Francisco--A new study, presented today at the Society of NeuroInterventional Surgery's (SNIS) 15th Annual Meeting, found that new stroke imaging technology could decrease delays in care by up to 60 minutes, giving patients a better chance at making a full recovery.

The study, New Multiple CT Assessment of Acute Stroke Patients: Are We Ready for Prime Time?, shows that recent advances in imaging software in the angiosuite give neurointerventionalists the essential details required to diagnose a patient with large vessel occlusion (LVO) for an endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). This study suggests that in the future, stroke patients can bypass the CT scan or emergency department and go directly to the angiosuite for imaging and proper care.

""By using this technology in the angiosuite, hospitals can reduce intra-facility transfer delays and hence the time of stroke symptom onset to treatment, which will significantly reduce brain damage and improve outcomes for patients,"" said Nicole Cancelliere, lead author of the study and an interventional clinical research technologist at Toronto Western Hospital.

The time required to transfer a patient from their CT scan to the operating room could delay EVT by as long as 60 minutes.

Preliminary results show that the cone beam imaging software compares favorably with baseline and follow-up CT scans. The imaging allows accurate detection of hemorrhage, occlusion site, ischemic core, and tissue at risk, suggesting that baseline imaging can be performed in the angiosuite using cone beam imaging. The lead PI on this study, Professor Vitor Mendes Pereira, concluded by saying, ""By reducing intra-facility transfer times, patients can receive EVT treatment sooner, which can significantly impact patient outcomes"".

"SAN DIEGO, CA - Knee pain in active patients over 40 is often difficult to treat but according to researchers presenting their work today at the American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine's (AOSSM) Annual Meeting in San Diego utilizing a special kind of allograft may be a step in the right direction.

""Our findings note that patients older than 40 may benefit from using a fresh osteochondral allograft transplantation to treat focal cartilage defects, a common cause of knee pain in adults,"" said lead author, Dennis Crawford, MD, PhD from the Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, Oregon.

Crawford and his colleagues looked at a total of 80 patients broken into two groups. The study group consisted of 38 patients, 10 women and 28 men who were at least 40 years of age and a control group with 42 patients (27 men and 15 women) who were 39 years of age or younger. A statistically significant improvement for both groups was noted for the final follow-up for IKDC and all five KOOS sub-scores. Greatest changes were seen in the ability of patients to perform Sports and with improvement in healthful daily activity. Previous surgical treatment was performed on 31 of 38 knees in the study group and 37 of the 42 knees in the control group.

""This type of osteochondral allograft transplantation has traditionally been used in younger active patients with cartilage disorders. However, seeing this type of success allows sports medicine physicians another option in older patients and serves as a predictable biologic joint preservation technique,"" said Crawford.

"Researchers at the Kennedy Institute and Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford, working with clinicians at NHS Lothian, have found that injection of the anti-TNF drug adalimumab into Dupuytren's disease nodules results in the reduction of the cell characteristics responsible for progression of Dupuytren's disease.

Based on their laboratory data that tumour necrosis factor (TNF) drives the development of myofibroblasts, the cell type that causes Dupuytren's disease, the research team explored the effect of an anti-TNF drug injected directly into the Dupuytren's nodule tissue. The results so far are very promising.

""Our data have shown that a concentrated formulation of adalimumab injected directly into the diseased tissue may be effective in targeting the cells responsible for Dupuytren's disease,"" said Jagdeep Nanchahal, MD, PhD, University of Oxford Professor of Hand, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, who led the study.

""This brings new hope to people who suffer from this disabling condition, who currently have to wait for their situation to be deteriorate, watching their hand lose function until it is bad enough for surgery. And then there's the lengthy recovery ahead, a less than ideal situation to find yourself in.""

This randomised trial (phase 2a) recruited 28 patients with Dupuytren's disease who were scheduled to have surgery in Edinburgh to remove diseased tissue in their hand. Two weeks prior to surgery they received a single injection of varying doses of the anti-TNF drug, or placebo. The tissue removed during surgery, which is usually discarded, was then analysed in the laboratory. The team found that adalimumab (at a dose of 40mg formulated in 0.4ml) reduces expression of the fibrotic markers, -smooth muscle actin (-SMA) and type I procollagen, at 2 weeks post injection, suggesting this drug could be used to stop the growth of disease causing myofibroblast cells. They also found the drug to be safe and well tolerated.

The findings are published on line in the journal EBioMedicine, published by The Lancet.

Dupuytren's disease is a common condition of the hand that affects 4% of the UK population and causes the fingers to curl irreversibly into the palm. There is currently no NICE approved treatment for early disease and typically people are told to return to their GP once their fingers become so bent that their hand function is impaired.

The anti-TNF drug adalimumab (Humira) is currently licensed in the EU for the treatment of a number of conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis and overall has an excellent safety profile.

""We are delighted to have received further funding from the Wellcome Trust and Department of Health to test whether adalimumab will work for patients with early stage Dupuytren's disease,"" said Professor Sir Marc Feldmann, co-author and former director of the Kennedy Institute. In conjunction with Professor Sir Ravinder Maini, Sir Marc identified TNF as a therapeutic target in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

""The Kennedy Institute has a long history of successfully translating laboratory findings to the clinic'"" said Professor Fiona Powrie, Director of the Institute. ""This type of work requires close collaboration between laboratory scientists, clinical trialists and clinician scientists over many years"".

The researchers are continuing to investigate the use of this drug to treat Dupuytren's disease in a phase 2b trial called the RIDD trial, which is currently running in Oxford and Edinburgh.

"OAK BROOK, Ill. - Cardiac hybrid imaging with CT and nuclear stress testing is an excellent long-term predictor of adverse cardiac events like heart attacks in patients being evaluated for coronary artery disease, according to a study published in the journal Radiology.

Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Invasive coronary angiography (ICA) is considered the gold standard for determining the percent of stenosis, or narrowing, due to plaque in a coronary artery. However, the degree of stenosis on ICA is not always an accurate predictor of heart attack risk because it gives no information on perfusion, or the flow of blood into the heart muscle. Inadequate perfusion, also known as ischemia, is a potential danger to the patient.

""In lesions with less than 50 percent narrowing, one in five lesions still produce an ischemia,"" said study coauthor Philipp A. Kaufmann, M.D., professor and chair of nuclear medicine, and director of cardiac imaging at University Hospital Zurich in Switzerland.

Cardiac hybrid imaging combines coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and myocardial perfusion imaging with single photon emission tomography (SPECT) to provide information on both stenosis and perfusion. The approach has shown promise in studies focusing on short-term observations, but information is lacking on long-term outcomes.

The research team looked at 428 patients who underwent hybrid imaging. During a median follow-up of 6.8 years, a total of 160 major adverse cardiac events, including 45 deaths, were observed in the final study population. Patients with matched findings--stenosis of 50 percent or more on CCTA with evidence of ischemia on SPECT in the area of the heart to which the blocked vessel was supplying blood--had more than five times the risk of adverse events than those with normal findings. Patients with unmatched findings, or evidence of ischemia but not in the area of the heart being fed by the stenotic artery, had three times the risk. Major adverse cardiac event rates were 21.8 percent for matched findings and 9.0 percent for unmatched--considerably higher than the 2.4 percent rate for normal findings.

The results show that cardiac hybrid imaging is an excellent long-term predictor of adverse cardiac events in patients evaluated for coronary artery disease. Dr. Kaufmann said that hybrid imaging findings could help guide treatment decisions, such as whether or not a patient should have a revascularization procedure such as bypass or angioplasty.

""In patients with multiple lesions or complex coronary anatomy, it is, in many cases, very difficult to correctly identify the culprit lesion,"" he said. ""In a previous multicenter trial, with hybrid imaging we were able to see that about one in five patients should be revascularized in another coronary artery than originally planned. The present study now documents the prognostic importance of the comprehensive assessment provided by hybrid imaging.""

The study supports CCTA use for an initial, noninvasive evaluation of patients with known or suspected stable coronary artery disease. No additional imaging would be necessary if the results were normal. If a lesion was evident, then clinicians could employ a nuclear scan to assess ischemia and take advantage of both modalities by fusing the results together to make a hybrid image.

""The strategy of direct referral to invasive coronary angiography without noninvasive imaging is obsolete,"" Dr. Kaufmann said. ""Even after documenting coronary artery disease with coronary CT angiography, we need further noninvasive evaluation before deciding upon revascularization versus medication.""

The researchers hope to run a trial to show that hybrid imaging can have a positive impact on patient outcomes. They are also looking at what they call ""triple hybrid"" imaging, which combines the CCTA/SPECT hybrid with information on coronary artery shear stress. The shear stress information could help identify lesions that do not yet have an impact on ischemia but will in the future.

"Ultrasound waves applied to the whole brain improve cognitive dysfunction in mice with conditions simulating vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The research, conducted by scientists at Tohoku University in Japan, suggests that this type of therapy may also benefit humans.

The team, led by cardiologist Hiroaki Shimokawa, found that applying low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) to the whole brain of the mice improved blood vessel formation and nerve cell regeneration without having obvious side effects.

""The LIPUS therapy is a non-invasive physiotherapy that could apply to high-risk elderly patients without the need for surgery or anaesthesia, and could be used repeatedly,"" says Shimokawa.

Dementia affects about 50 million people worldwide, with 10 million new cases occurring every year. But there are currently no curative treatments available for vascular dementia or Alzheimer's disease, the most common causes of dementia. Also, the cells lining the brain's blood vessels are tightly packed, forming a blood-brain barrier that prevents large molecules from crossing into the brain tissue. This limits the types of drugs and cell therapies that could be made available to treat dementia.

Shimokawa and his team had conducted previous studies showing that LIPUS improved blood vessel formation in pigs with myocardial ischemia, a condition where there is reduced blood flow to the heart. Other studies have reported that LIPUS increases the production of proteins involved in nerve cell survival and growth, in addition to a role in promoting nerve regeneration. Focusing LIPUS treatment on a region in the brain called the hippocampus, which is involved in memory, has also been found to improve dementia in mice, but the details of how it does this need to be more fully investigated.

The Tohoku University team wanted to find out if whole-brain rather than focused LIPUS is effective in treating mouse models of dementia, and if it was, what was happening at the molecular levels to achieve this.

They found that cognitive impairment markedly improved in mice with conditions similar to vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease when LIPUS was applied to the whole brain three times a day for 20 minutes each time. The mice with vascular dementia received the treatment on the first, third and fifth days following a surgical procedure that limited the brain's blood supply. The mice with a condition simulating Alzheimer's disease in humans received 11 LIPUS treatments over a period of three months.

At the molecular level, genes related to the cells lining blood vessels were turned on. Also, there was increased expression of an enzyme involved in blood vessel formation and a protein involved in nerve cell survival and growth.

The researchers conclude that their study, recently published in the journal Brain Stimulation, provides the first experimental evidence that whole-brain LIPUS therapy markedly improves cognitive dysfunctions without serious side effects by enhancing specific cells related to dementia's pathology.

The first clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the LIPUS treatment are already underway.

"MAYWOOD, IL - Robotic surgery is as effective as traditional open surgery in treating bladder cancer, according to a landmark study published in the journal Lancet.

Three Loyola Medicine urologists, Marcus Quek, MD, Gopal Gupta, MD, and Alex Gorbonos, MD, are co-authors of the study. First author is Dipen Parekh, MD, of the University of Miami.

Loyola is among 15 centers that participated in the nationwide trial of 350 patients, who were randomly assigned to undergo robotic surgery or open surgery to remove cancerous bladders.

After two years, there was no significant difference between the two groups in survival without disease progression. Robotic surgery was associated with less blood loss and shorter hospital stays, but longer surgeries. There were no significant differences in complication rates or in patients' quality of life. The study is called RAZOR (randomized open versus robotic cystectomy trial) and was funded by the National Cancer Institute.

A robotic system allows a surgeon to perform operations through a few small incisions. Movements by the surgeon's hand or wrist are translated into highly precise movements of the surgical instruments. Every maneuver is directed by the surgeon, in real time, as the surgeon views a magnified, 3D, high-definition image of the surgical site.

Since robotic surgery was introduced in 2000, it has spread rapidly and has been used in about four million surgeries worldwide. But apart from the RAZOR trial, there have been no prospective, randomized multicenter trials to assess how robotic surgery compares to open surgery in cancer survival.

The RAZOR trial found that two years after surgery, 72.3 percent of patients in the robotic surgery group were alive, with no disease progression and essentially cured, compared with 71.6 percent in the open surgery group. Sixty-seven percent of robotic surgery patients experienced adverse effects such as urinary tract infections and intestinal obstructions, compared with 69 percent in the open surgery group.

Robotic surgery patients stayed a median of six days in the hospital, compared with seven days in the open surgery group. Robotic surgery patients lost less than half as much blood as open surgery patients, but spent more time in the operating room (seven hours, eight minutes compared with six hours, one minute).

Researchers wrote that the findings ""underscore the need for further high-quality trials to assess surgical innovation before this surgical technique is widely adopted in clinical practice.""

Dr. Gupta added that the study provides evidence demonstrating that the robotic approach performs at least as well as the open approach. ""It is important to conduct these trials before widespread adoption of technology, as has been the case with robotic prostatectomy (removal of the prostate),"" he said.

###

The study is titled ""Robot-assisted radical cystectomy versus open radical cystectomy in patients with bladder cancer (RAZOR): an open-label, randomized, phase 3, non-inferiority trial.""

Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer in men, but it is less common in women. The American Cancer Society estimates this year there will be about 81,000 new cases in the United States, and about 17,000 people will die of the disease.

The standard surgical treatment of invasive bladder cancer is a radical cystectomy (removal of the bladder). Three main techniques are used to replace the bladder: construct a new bladder (neobladder) from the patient's intestine; place a pouch inside the body to act as an artificial bladder; or place a bag outside the body to collect urine. Loyola Medicine offers both open and robotic radical cystectomy and all three bladder replacement techniques. There are pros and cons to each surgical technique, and Loyola physicians help patients decide which option best fits their lifestyle and health status.

Loyola Medicine is nationally recognized for its expertise in diagnosing and treating a broad range of urologic conditions and providing integrated services for optimal patient care. Loyola's department of urology is ranked 39th in the country by U.S. News and World Report."

"Sugar improves memory in older adults -- and makes them more motivated to perform difficult tasks at full capacity -- according to new research by the University of Warwick

Sugar improves memory in older adults - and makes them more motivated to perform difficult tasks at full capacity - according to new research by the University of Warwick.

Led by PhD student Konstantinos Mantantzis, Professor Elizabeth Maylor and Dr Friederike Schlaghecken in Warwick's Department of Psychology, the study found that increasing blood sugar levels not only improves memory and performance, but makes older adults feel happier during a task.

The researchers gave young (aged 18-27) and older (aged 65-82) participants a drink containing a small amount of glucose, and got them to perform various memory tasks. Other participants were given a placebo - a drink containing artificial sweetener.

The researchers measured participants' levels of engagement with the task, their memory score, mood, and their own perception of effort.

They found that increasing energy through a glucose drink can help both young and older adults to try harder compared to those who had the artificial sweetener. For young adults, that's where it ended, though: glucose did not improve either their mood or their memory performance.

However, older adults who had a glucose drink showed significantly better memory and more positive mood compared to older adults who consumed the artificial sweetener.

Moreover, although objective measures of task engagement showed that older adults in the glucose group put more effort into the task than those who consumed the artificial sweetener, their own self-reports showed that they did not feel as if they had tried any harder.

The authors concluded that short-term energy availability in the form of raised blood sugar levels could be an important factor in older adults' motivation to perform a task at their highest capacity.

Heightened motivation, in turn, could explain the fact that increased blood sugar levels also increase older adults' sense of self-confidence, decrease self-perceptions of effort, and improve mood. However, more research is needed to disentangle these factors in order to fully understand how energy availability affects cognitive engagement, and to develop clear dietary guidelines for older adults.

Konstantinos Mantantzis, a PhD student from the University of Warwick's Department of Psychology, commented:

""Over the years, studies have shown that actively engaging with difficult cognitive tasks is a prerequisite for the maintenance of cognitive health in older age. Therefore, the implications of uncovering the mechanisms that determine older adults' levels of engagement cannot be understated.""

Dr Friederike Schlaghecken, from the University of Warwick's Department of Psychology, commented:

""Our results bring us a step closer to understanding what motivates older adults to exert effort and finding ways of increasing their willingness to try hard even if a task seems impossible to perform.""

"Depression is among the leading causes of disability worldwide, with more than 300 million people suffering from this mental illness, according to the World Health Organization.

Despite how common depression is, scientists still have a lot to learn about it.

Among what is known is that depression is not a single disease but a variety of feelings and behaviors that may have different underlying causes.

“Depressive disorders can present differently in different people. What is known now is that depression affects not just the brain but the whole organism,”said Natalie Rasgon, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University.

But a new study of which Rasgon is a senior author finds evidence of a possible biomarker for major depressive disorder, which could lead to better treatments for this sometimes crippling disease.

The study by a group of researchers from around the U.S. and in Sweden finds that a specific, naturally-occurring chemical, called acetyl-L-carnitine, or LAC, is lower in the blood of people suffering from depression. The research was published this week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

“Previous animal studies convincingly showed the role of LAC in models of depression. This study is the first confirmation of the results from animal studies in human subjects with depression,” Rasgon told ABC News.

Levels of the chemical were lower among people with more severe depression

Researchers measured LAC levels in the blood of 116 participants, and found that those with depression had significantly lower levels of the chemical than healthy individuals. Two groups of people at two different hospitals were examined, with the same results.

LAC levels were especially low among people whose depression was more severe, who began suffering from the disease at an earlier age or who had a history of childhood trauma. Levels were lowest among females whose depression did not get better with medications or therapy, known as “treatment-resistant depression,” and who had suffered childhood trauma or neglect.

The human body naturally produces LAC from a nutrient called carnitine, but researchers found that carnitine levels were the same in people with and without depression. This suggests that differing levels of LAC can be attributed to depression and not to diet.

What do we know about this chemical?

LAC performs a number of important tasks, including regulating how the brain and nervous system use energy. It also can interact with DNA to change how certain genes are expressed.

In previous studies, LAC has been shown to effectively and rapidly improve symptoms of depression in mice.

A review of multiple studies published in the Journal of Psychosomatic Medicine in 2017 showed that acetyl-L-carnitine may be better than a placebo in treating depression and may be as effective as common antidepressants but with fewer side effects. The review authors noted the studies were very small and larger trials are necessary to confirm any benefit.

There is a LAC supplement that has been used for dementia, but a 2003 review from Cochrane found it is unlikely to be of benefit for this purpose. Some studies suggest a benefit for a type of nerve pain called neuropathy.

But it is important to note this study did not test if LAC can be used for the treatment of depression.

“We are at the very beginning of this discovery and can’t recommend people to buy this supplement at the GNC store,” warned Rasgon.

STOCK PHOTO/Getty Images

How further research might lead to possible treatments

LAC has potential to be a biomarker, something measurable in the body that reflects the presence of a disease. As such, it could potentially be used to screen for and diagnose severe or treatment-resistant depression and allow for earlier and more aggressive treatment.

Researchers hope future studies could shed light on whether physical activity, dietary habits, and sleep may affect LAC levels.

This study also found that people on antidepressant drugs still had lower levels of LAC in their blood, suggesting that taking supplements of the chemical might be helpful or possibly even necessary to fully benefit from a medication.

This research, together with prior studies, suggests that correcting a deficiency in LAC could be a step toward more targeted treatments of depression, especially for those who suffered childhood trauma or began having depression at an early age.

“We are excited with these results and are working on extending them to further understand the role of LAC in patients receiving treatment for depression,”Rasgon said. “It is one of the pieces of a very large puzzle that constitutes depressive disorders as an illness.”

While this study has important implications in understanding depression, Rasgon cautioned that it requires larger studies to confirm the findings. “There are many questions to be answered – who will ultimately benefit from taking this supplement, what is the right dose, what is the appropriate duration of use.”

The study was a collaboration between researchers at Stanford, Rockefeller University, Duke University, Weill Cornell Medical College, the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden.

"Young people suffering from treatment-resistant depression (TRD) showed a significant reduction of their symptoms after being administered ketamine injections, according to a study published in the Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology.

Researchers from the University of Minnesota and non-profit The Mayo Clinic found that ketamine caused an average decrease of 42% on the Children’s Depression Rating Scale (CDRS)—the most widely used rating scale in research trials for assessing the severity of depression and change in depressive symptoms among adolescents.

Ketamine is perhaps best known for being a popular recreational drug and a useful medical anesthetic, but an increasing body of research is showing that the compound coulde be an effective treatment for depression. Several recent studies have shown that even a single dose in adults can lead to rapid reductions in depressive symptoms. However, relatively little research has been conducted into ketamine's antidepressant effects in adolescents.

“Adolescence is a key time period for emergence of depression and represents an opportune and critical developmental window for intervention to prevent negative outcomes,” the authors wrote in the study.

“Unfortunately, about 40% of adolescents do not respond to their first intervention and only half of non-responders respond to the second treatment,” they said. “Because standard interventions require prolonged periods (e.g., weeks to months) to assess efficacy, serial treatment failures allow illness progression, which in turn worsens the outcome. Hence, novel treatment strategies to address treatment-resistant depression in adolescents are urgently needed.”

The latest study involved thirteen young people aged between 12 and 18 years of age who had failed two previous trials of anti-depressants. Over two weeks the researchers gave them six ketamine infusions.

They found that the treatment was well tolerated, with the participants showing an average decrease in CDRS scores of 42.5%. Five of the participants met the criteria for clinical response and remission. Of these, three were still in remission after 6-weeks, while the remaining two relapsed within two weeks.

According to the scientists, the results demonstrate the potential role for ketamine in treating adolescents with TRD. However, they note that the study was limited by its small sample size, so future research will be needed to confirm these results.

""The field is excited about a potential new agent for adolescents with treatment resistant depression,” Harold S. Koplewicz, Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology said in a statement. “We look forward to additional studies of ketamine to validate this treatment.”

Questions also remain regarding the long-term safety of ketamine as a depression treatment, so more information will be needed before broader clinical use.

James Stone, a Clinical Senior Lecturer from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King's College London, who was not involved in the study, told Newsweek that there is ""a lot of potential for the use of ketamine as a second or third line antidepressant where other treatments have failed.""

""Although ketamine is potentially a huge breakthrough in the treatment of depression, we still don’t know about the long-term safety, or about how to keep people well from depression without requiring regular ketamine dosing,"" Stone added. ""Further studies are needed to address these questions."""

"IRVINE, Calif., Aug. 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- MDxHealth SA (OTC: MDXHF.BR) today announces that a new study validates the cost-effectiveness of the SelectMDx® for Prostate Cancer test, a non-invasive, urine-based (liquid biopsy) test that helps identify patients at increased risk of aggressive prostate cancer. The SelectMDx test can help predict the likelihood that clinically significant prostate cancer will be found by a biopsy.

The study published in The Journal of Urology, led by researchers at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, was designed to elucidate the cost-effectiveness of SelectMDx in a population of U.S. men with elevated PSA, a marker of prostate cancer risk. Researchers analyzed the impact of utilizing the non-invasive diagnostic test prior to prostate biopsy. The primary objective was to characterize changes in health outcomes, measured in quality-adjusted life years, and a secondary objective was evaluating healthcare costs.

The researchers found that incorporating SelectMDx resulted in an average gain of 0.045 life years, or approximately 16 days, in full health gained at a cost-savings of $1,694 for each patient undergoing biopsy. Extrapolating these data to a conservative estimate of 311,879 patients per year undergoing biopsy resulted in 14,035 life years in full health gained with an annual cost saving of more than $500 million for each cohort.

""This study demonstrated that routine use of SelectMDx to guide biopsy decision-making improves health outcomes and lowers healthcare costs associated with prostate cancer risk assessment in a population of U.S. men,"" said Dr. Matthew Resnick from the departments of Urologic Surgery and Health Policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN. ""We believe that this strategy improves the value of conventional risk assessment strategies through improvements in both quality and cost, the numerator and denominator of the health care value equation.""

Every year, 1.3 million men in the U.S. undergo a prostate biopsy.i Although a biopsy is the only way to diagnose prostate cancer, the procedure is invasive and results in complications in 18 percent of patients, with 3 percent hospitalized for infection within 30 days.ii,iii,iv Common complications from a prostate biopsy may include bleeding, infection, sepsis/bacteremia, urinary symptoms/retention, and sexual dysfunction.

""While biopsy is the only path to prostate cancer diagnosis, no man wants to, nor should have to, go through the uncomfortable, costly procedure if it can be avoided,"" said Dr. Jan Groen, Chief Executive Officer of MDxHealth. ""We developed SelectMDx to help reduce unnecessary biopsies and now we have the data to show how we can both improve outcomes and save the system money.""

The full paper is accessible via the online edition of The Journal of Urology.

HealthDay Reporter

TUESDAY, Aug. 7, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Dialysis patients waiting for kidney transplants might safely accept an organ from a donor infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), a new study finds.

Using hepatitis C-infected kidneys would expand the organ pool and save lives, said lead researcher Dr. Peter Reese. He's an associate professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia.

""There is a tremendous lack of kidneys for transplant,"" he explained. ""Because of the opioid crisis, there are many people who die from a drug overdose and have HCV and want to donate their organs.""

But these infected kidneys are discarded, even though they are otherwise healthy. And many are from younger people, Reese said.

Of roughly a half-million patients in the United States who were on dialysis for late-stage kidney disease in 2016, only 19,000 received kidney transplants. This is partly due to organ shortages, researchers have reported. And the average wait time for a non-infected kidney is more than two years, compared to eight months for an HCV-infected kidney.

New, less toxic treatments for hepatitis C opened the door for transplanting infected kidneys and then successfully treating the infection, Reese said.

In a study of 20 uninfected patients, researchers found that transplanting infected kidneys and then treating recipients for HCV resulted in a 100 percent cure rate. Half were evaluated six months after their transplant and the others a year after.

""And we found that these kidney transplants were working as well as kidney transplants from uninfected patients,"" Reese said.

The potential cost savings could be significant, he added. Dialysis can cost more than $88,000 a year, according to the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

Though some patients might not want to take the risk associated with an infected kidney, others might consider it a good option, given the high death rates for dialysis patients awaiting transplants, the researchers suggested.

The report was published online Aug. 6 in the Annals of Internal Medicine.

Dr. Adnan Sharif, a consultant transplant nephrologist at Queen Elizabeth Hospital and University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom, wrote an accompanying editorial.

Sharif said the excellent short-term outcomes and 100 percent cure rate of HCV in organ recipients should prompt transplant centers to rethink use of HCV-infected kidneys.

""We must be bold in our approach to utilizing HCV kidneys,"" he said.

Sharif acknowledged, however, that using HCV-infected kidneys would represent ""a significant shift in our attitude to risk, procurement of organs and counseling potential recipients appropriately about the risks -- albeit minimal.""

But the cost effectiveness of using these kidneys versus remaining on dialysis would be significant, he noted.

Another study, published in the same journal in July, reported similar success in transplants of HCV-infected kidneys into HCV-infected patients. About 15 percent of dialysis patients have HCV, the researchers said.

Sharif said other organs from HCV-infected donors, such as hearts and lungs, might also be safely transplanted, expanding those organs' supply, as well.

""Using such donors could lead to many life-saving or enhancing transplants,"" he said.

"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the first time ever has green-lighted a birth control app to be marketed as a method of contraception.

The app, Natural Cycles, calculates when a woman is most likely to be fertile using their daily body temperature data and their menstrual cycle information.

The app then tells users what days they are more likely to be fertile and should abstain from sex or use protection if they do not wish to get pregnant.

Natural Cycles

""Consumers are increasingly using digital health technologies to inform their everyday health decisions, and this new app can provide an effective method of contraception if it’s used carefully and correctly,"" Dr. Terri Cornelison, the assistant director for the health of women in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in a statement.

""But women should know that no form of contraception works perfectly, so an unplanned pregnancy could still result from correct usage of this device,"" she added.

The app had a ""perfect use"" failure rate of 1.8 percent in clinical studies that involved more than 15,500 women, or a ""typical use"" failure rate of 6.5 percent, according to the FDA. The ""typical use"" failure rate took into account women who sometimes did not use the app correctly or may have had unprotected sex on a day when the app flagged that they were fertile.

STOCK PHOTO/Getty Images

Natural Cycles has, however, courted controversy in Europe, as some women have reported unwanted pregnancies while using the app as their main form of birth control.

Sweden's public broadcasting company SVT reported that 37 out of 668 women who received an abortion at a Stockholm hospital from September 2017 to the end of December 2017 were using the app and still had an unwanted pregnancy.

ABC News' chief medical correspondent Dr. Jennifer Ashton emphasized that no method of contraception is perfect except abstinence, so it's not completely surprising that women have still gotten pregnant while using it.

Ashton added that apps can be useful in that they enourage women to be aware of their bodies' monthly changes. If a woman does decide to use an app for birth control, however, she needs to have a plan for what she would do if she does have an unplanned pregnancy.

Most contraception pills have a ""typical use"" failure rate of approximately 9 percent, according to Ashton, which is actually higher than the rate of the app, the FDA's data showed.

Still, Asthon says that women should ask their doctors about risks, benefits and alternatives for any contraceptive method they are using."

"ISNES, Belgium, Aug. 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- VolitionRx Limited (NYSE AMERICAN: VNRX) (""Volition"") today announced preliminary data from a prospective, multi-centered Proof of Concept Study of 84 men into the utility of Volition's Nu.Q™ assays to diagnose men with high-grade prostate cancer.

Volition panel PSA alone 94% 33%

At 88% specificity, the Volition panel of five assays (including PSA) identified 94% of high-grade prostate cancers that require treatment (as defined by Gleason Score1). This compares with just 33% identified by Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) alone.

""This is a very exciting outcome for us as we continue the development of our assays beyond colorectal cancer. The preliminary data from this study showed that Volition's panel of assays identified men with potentially lethal high-grade prostate cancer with much greater accuracy than PSA alone. Based on this data, we believe that this test could assist clinicians in more accurate patient selection for prostate biopsy and treatment and substantially reduce the amount of unnecessary procedures in men with low-grade tumors or no tumor. The next step is to confirm these statistically significant findings in independent larger clinical trials"" said Dr. Jake Micallef, Chief Scientific Officer at Volition.

Prostate cancer (PCA) is the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the U.S. after lung cancer2. Currently, PCA is diagnosed through medical history, physical examination and by elevated levels of PSA in the blood. Men suspected of PCA are given a prostate biopsy to confirm the presence of cancer. However, most men with elevated PSA levels referred for prostate biopsy either have no cancer or have low-grade cancer which needs monitoring but not treatment.

In the Proof of Concept Study, a blood sample was taken prospectively from men referred for prostate biopsy in three Belgian hospitals. The men were grouped by biopsy findings as having no cancer (most of whom had elevated PSA levels), low-grade cancer or high-grade cancer. The samples were tested with a panel of five assays (PSA, two Nu.Q™ assays and two inflammatory biomarkers).

The assay results correlated with the Gleason Score, which is one of the main predictors for aggressive PCA determined on biopsy. This suggests the assays may provide better risk stratification than that available using PSA tests for men with actual or suspected PCA, leading to better patient management and fewer unnecessary biopsies.

Commenting on the results, Principal Investigator, Professor Thierry Roumeguere, Head of Urological Services, Erasme Hospital, Brussels, Belgium said ""A non-invasive test to help in the risk stratification of men with suspected or actual prostate cancer will be a major step forward in the management of this disease. The correlation of the panel blood test results with Gleason Score shows great promise in this regard. We will further investigate the data in relation to disease stage as well as additional factors used for pre-treatment risk stratification.""

Cameron Reynolds, Chief Executive Officer at Volition commented ""This small trial is important because it helps demonstrate once more the potential breadth of our technology.

HealthDay Reporter

WEDNESDAY, Aug. 15, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- For women with advanced breast cancer who carry the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations, an experimental drug could improve survival, a new study suggests.

The BRCA mutations are linked with a greater risk for aggressive breast and ovarian cancer. The drug, talazoparib, works by blocking an enzyme called poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), thus preventing cancer cells from killing healthy ones.

In a phase 3 trial of 431 women, funded by the drug's maker, those who received talazoparib lived longer without their cancer progressing than women treated with standard chemotherapy by an average of three months, researchers found.

""For women with metastatic breast cancer and a BRCA mutation, PARP inhibitors may be considered for their treatment,"" said lead researcher Dr. Jennifer Litton, an associate professor of breast medical oncology at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.

When it's functioning properly, BRCA actually helps repair damaged DNA and prevents tumors, but when BRCA1 and BRCA2 go awry, they encourage breast cancers.

PARP inhibitors such as talazoparib appear to interfere with the function of mutated BRCA in breast cells, causing them to die rather replicate.

In addition, several ongoing studies are looking at combinations with PARP inhibitors ""to try to expand who may benefit or lengthen how long they may work,"" Litton said.

The trial results are preliminary, as talazoparib has not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

In January, the FDA approved the first PARP inhibitor, Lynparza, to treat BRCA-mutated breast cancer.

Similar drugs have already been used to treat advanced, BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer, according to the agency.

In the current trial, the women who were randomly selected to receive talazoparib had a higher response rate to treatment than women who received standard chemotherapy: 63 percent versus 27 percent, the researchers found.

The drug does have side effects. Among women receiving talazoparib, 55 percent had blood disorders, mostly anemia, compared with 38 percent of those receiving standard chemotherapy.

In addition, 32 percent of the women receiving talazoparib had other side effects, compared with 38 percent of those on standard chemotherapy.

Oncologist Dr. Marisa Weiss is the founder and chief medical officer of Breastcancer.org. ""Smart medicines like this PARP inhibitor work better than traditional chemo in women with HER2-negative metastatic disease and a BRCA1/2 genetic mutation,"" she said.

This targeted form of treatment takes advantage of a weakness in the BRCA gene to further cripple the cancer cell's ability to repair itself, grow and spread, said Weiss, who was not involved with the study.

Normal cells are mostly spared. As a result, more cancer cells are killed with fewer side effects, Weiss said.

""Most importantly, patients themselves have reported a better experience with less hair loss and improved quality of life,"" she said.

Weiss advises women with advanced breast cancer to have genetic testing.

""In both my clinical practice and within the online support community, we advise women with metastatic breast cancer to get genetic testing upon diagnosis, in order to get the best care first,"" she said.

The trial was funded by drug maker Pfizer, and the results were published Aug. 15 in the New England Journal of Medicine.

"Blood test may identify gestational diabetes risk in first trimester

NIH analysis suggests early screening could allow for lifestyle changes before condition develops.

A blood test conducted as early as the 10th week of pregnancy may help identify women at risk for gestational diabetes, a pregnancy-related condition that poses potentially serious health risks for mothers and infants, according to researchers at the National Institutes of Health and other institutions. The study appears in Scientific Reports.

Gestational diabetes occurs only in pregnancy and results when the level of blood sugar, or glucose, rises too high. Gestational diabetes increases the mother’s chances for high blood pressure disorders of pregnancy and the need for cesarean delivery, and the risk for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes later in life. For infants, gestational diabetes increases the risk for large birth size. Unless they have a known risk factor, such as obesity, women typically are screened for gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy.

In the current study, researchers evaluated whether the HbA1c test (also called the A1C test), commonly used to diagnose type 2 diabetes, could identify signs of gestational diabetes in the first trimester of pregnancy. The test approximates the average blood glucose levels over the previous 2 or 3 months, based on the amount of glucose that has accumulated on the surface of red blood cells. According to the authors, comparatively few studies have examined whether the HbA1c test could help identify the risk for gestational diabetes, and these studies have been limited to women already at high risk for the condition. The test is not currently recommended to diagnose gestational diabetes at any point in pregnancy.

The researchers analyzed records from the NICHD Fetal Growth Study, a large observational study that recruited more than 2,000 low-risk pregnant women from 12 U.S. clinical sites between 2009 and 2013. The researchers compared HbA1c test results from 107 women who later developed gestational diabetes to test results from 214 women who did not develop the condition. Most of the women had tests at four intervals during pregnancy: early (weeks 8-13), middle (weeks 16-22 and 24-29) and late (weeks 34-37).

Women who went on to develop gestational diabetes had higher HbA1c levels (an average of 5.3 percent), compared to those without gestational diabetes (an average HbA1c level of 5.1 percent). Each .1 percent increase in HbA1c above 5.1 percent in early pregnancy was associated with a 22-percent higher risk for gestational diabetes.

In middle pregnancy, HbA1c levels declined for both groups. However, HbA1c levels increased in the final third of pregnancy, which is consistent with the decrease in sensitivity to insulin that often occurs during this time period.

“Our results suggest that the HbA1C test potentially could help identify women at risk for gestational diabetes early in pregnancy, when lifestyle changes may be more effective in reducing their risk,” said the study’s senior author, Cuilin Zhang, Ph.D., of the Epidemiology Branch at NIH’s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

Exercise and a healthy diet may lower blood glucose levels during pregnancy. If these measures are not successful, physicians may prescribe insulin to bring blood glucose under control.

The authors noted that further studies are needed to confirm whether measuring HbA1c levels in early pregnancy could determine a woman’s later risk for gestational diabetes. Similarly, research is needed to determine whether lowering HbA1c with lifestyle changes, either in early pregnancy or before pregnancy, could reduce the risk for the condition.

"Scientists say they have created a new drug that can attack ovarian and lung cancers in patients for whom other treatments have failed.

The U.K.-based researchers used a new drug along with chemotherapy medication known as paclitaxel on 25 women with high-grade, serous ovarian cancer, and 40 participants with squamous non-small cell lung cancer. The cancers had spread across the bodies of each participant, who did not respond to standard treatment.

Over half of patients with ovarian cancer and over a third with lung cancer saw their tumors shrink, according to the study, which was published in the Annals of Oncology.

The cocktail also stopped the cancer growing for almost six months, which is unexpected for patients with advanced-stage cancers who were unresponsive to currently available treatments, including chemotherapy, the authors said.

The research was led by scientists at The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, as well as teams in nine institutions across the U.K.

It built on previous research by the ICR that showed ovarian cancer cells resistant to treatment generally have higher levels of a molecule called p-S6K, which aids the growth of the disease. The scientists hypothesized the cancer could use this molecule to render chemotherapy ineffective.

Vistusertib attacks proteins called mTOR1 and 2, which turn on the p-S6K protein. Combined with paclitaxel chemotherapy, the scientists were able to block cancer cells from harnessing p-S6K. That is why the patients’ tumors shrunk, the study suggests.

Dr. Susana Banerjee, consultant medical oncologist at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust and team leader in gynecological cancers at ICR, who is leading the phase II trial, commented in a statement: “Effective treatment options for women with relapsed ovarian cancer are limited, so these results are very encouraging.

Commenting on the next stage of the research, she said: “In the larger phase II trial we’ve recruited 140 women with relapsed ovarian cancer across the U.K. to standard chemotherapy (paclitaxel) or paclitaxel in combination with vistusertib. We need to wait for these results, expected later this year, to see how effective this approach is compared to chemotherapy alone.”

Dr. Dean A. Fennell, professor and consultant in thoracic medical oncology at the University of Leicester, who was not involved in the study, told Newsweek the study presents an “exciting result.”

He was particularly surprised by the magnitude of the response triggered by vistusertib combined with paclitaxel, which is closely related to standard chemotherapy.

However, Fennell said the study tripped up in that there was no predictive link between mutations and response to treatment. “In other words, there was no sign of who might benefit the most with treatment,"" he explained.

He continued: “This combination of vistusertib and paclitaxel appears promising in lung cancer. Confirmatory studies will be essential and if positive would broaden our armamentarium for fighting this cancer.”"	Experimental Drug Vistusertib Could Shrinks Tumors in 50% of Ovarian Cancer Patients, Study Suggests	2018-08-22 01:00:02	https://web.archive.org/web/20180822012411/https://www.newsweek.com/scientists-develop-drug-which-could-treat-lung-and-ovarian-cancers-1083747	story_reviews_00039	fake
"“Let’s talk about your test results,” my neurologist said.

She looked as if she had good news. Instead, it was shocking.

The carotid artery on the left side of my neck, one of the brain’s two main sources of blood and oxygen, was clogged with fatty plaque, the doctor said. The artery was almost completely blocked.

There must be a mistake, I thought frantically. I exercise and am healthy and young. Actually, I’m 68, but, you know, a young 68. You are in danger of a major stroke, she said, and need an operation. Immediately.

The irony wasn’t lost on me. As a journalist covering the medical field, I have spent years writing about strokes, most of which are caused by clots blocking blood flow to the brain. Now I faced the unnerving question: Am I going to become a weird punch line? As in: Did you see that the guy who writes all those stories about strokes just had a big one?

A blocked carotid artery didn’t seem possible for an active person like me. I’ve never smoked. I’ve run, lifted weights or done something aerobic like playing tennis pretty much every day of my life. I watch what I eat. I even wrote an article about how I kept my bad cholesterol in check with diet and exercise, not medication.

While I’m addicted to cheese, and my weight has climbed some, I’ve eaten foods like salmon and oatmeal with fervor for more than 20 years. So I figured I was exempt from medical crises.

The diagnosis made me reconsider dilemmas that had once seemed academic. For example, should older Americans be screened for blocked carotid arteries?

Critical Paths The carotid arteries are passageways through which blood and oxygen move to a person's brain and face. When fatty plaque obstructs an artery, the blood supply can be reduced or cut off, sometimes resulting in a stroke.

External carotid arteries supply blood to face and neck 2. Internal carotid arteries supply blood to brain 1 1 2 2 DETAIL Internal External Blockage caused by fatty plaque Blood flow Common carotid artery

Clots cause about 700,000 strokes that lead to 130,000 deaths annually in the U.S. and are the primary preventable cause of disability, according to the American Stroke Association. Carotid disease is a main cause of those strokes—nearly 200,000 strokes a year, vascular specialists say. Yet 80% of those patients have no symptoms before the strokes.

In 2014, a U.S. task force concluded that people with no symptoms don’t have to be screened for carotid disease, saying that the risks, such as poor surgery, “outweigh the benefits.” But the task force—a panel of private doctors assigned by law to help set U.S. medical policy—focused on screening in the general population, not older patients.

The task force said there aren’t enough carotid-caused strokes to warrant screening everyone. Of course, not everyone with carotid blockage will get surgery; thousands of people with the condition can benefit from drug therapy.

My experience, along with some evidence from screening of thousands of individuals, raises questions about the task force’s conclusions. The Society for Vascular Surgery recommends screening people over 65 with coronary disease, high blood pressure or a history of smoking.

The task force generally supports screening Americans for breast cancer, with 253,000 new cases in women and 41,000 estimated deaths annually, as well as colorectal cancer, with 135,000 new cases and 50,000 deaths a year. Government and private insurance pay to screen for these illnesses, but not for carotid screening of non-symptomatic people, which can cost about $70 a person.

After hearing the jarring news about my dangerously blocked carotid, I faced a big decision. My wife Christa and I live near Washington, D.C. Our daughter, Maddie, was supposed to be married in San Francisco in June, a week after the neurologist told me I needed surgery right away. Suddenly the prospect of being at the wedding seemed iffy.

Conventional wisdom says that among the 65-and-older set, only those with symptoms should be tested. That often means individuals who have had mini-strokes, which tend to be brief periods in which the patient has something wrong on one side of the body, usually for a few minutes. Symptoms often include slurred speech, temporary vision loss, a one-sided facial droop and arm or leg weakness or numbness.

Vascular surgeon George Lavenson Jr. wrote in 2012 in the Journal for Vascular Ultrasound that among 22,146 people screened for carotid disease during four public screening campaigns between 2001 and 2006, about 7.5% were found to have blockage of 60% or more—enough to warrant treatment with medication.

“It is hard to understand how many leaders in the medical profession can object to a one- to two-minute accurate screen of seniors that can find the 7.5% with silent carotid artery disease,” Dr. Lavenson said. Those patients can be “evaluated and managed to prevent them from being one of the 700,000 clot-caused strokes we continue to have annually.”

Most doctors would have put me in the asymptomatic, or less-risky, category. But five years ago, I went out for a run of about 7 miles along the Potomac River. At the end of the run, my right leg started shaking. That seldom happened again until the past few months, when it started recurring more often, along with shaking in the right arm.

My physician, Joel Taubin, recommended a neurologist, Rhanni Herzfeld, of the Neurology Center in Washington. She prescribed tests to discern the cause of the shaking, perhaps a pinched nerve, incipient epilepsy, a neurological disorder or a tumor. The results ruled them all out.

Then an MRI of my head showed a few white spots on the left side. Dr. Herzfeld wondered if I might have had some “silent strokes,” sending tiny bits of artery plaque floating to my brain—and now appearing as white spots on the scan. Fatty plaque accumulates in most people’s arteries, and can form clots that break off and can cause strokes.

Dr. Herzfeld ordered a carotid ultrasound of the arteries on both sides of my neck. It’s a quick, painless and very accurate scan. Moments later, we were talking in her office. My right carotid artery was perfectly clear, she said. The left was almost completely blocked and I needed immediate surgery to clear it.

I asked if we could treat the obstruction with anti-platelet medication, such as Plavix.

“No, your blockage is just too extensive,” Dr. Herzfeld said. She recommended that Bruce A. Perler, a professor of vascular surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, do the procedure.

The effectiveness of carotid-artery surgery in people without symptoms—but major blockage—was established two decades ago by the Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Stenosis trial, funded by the National Institutes of Health. It showed, in hospitals in the U.S. and Canada, that the risk of stroke or death in surgery patients after a median 2.7 years was 5.1%, less than half that of people treated only with drugs. An international study published in 2010 in the Lancet showed similar benefits from surgery.

I consulted with other doctors, including one who said, “This isn’t quite an emergency, but it’s urgent.”

The operation is serious, with the rates of stroke and death within 30 days after surgery totaling about 2.4% in major studies examined by the task force. The task force noted that this typical measure can be as high as 5% at some low-volume hospitals.

People considering this operation should ask their hospital, surgeon or academic medical center about their rates of stroke and death after surgery. Few hospitals and surgeons in the U.S. publish their individual results. Dr. Perler’s rate was well under 1%. He said my risk of stroke was 10% to 15% over five years, probably in the first year.

A week before Maddie’s wedding, my wife and I met with Dr. Perler at Johns Hopkins. On the drive to Baltimore, we called Maddie. She sounded frightened and I told her maybe I wouldn’t need surgery—or could put it off. We also told her brothers, Jamie and Will, and her sister, Samantha, what was going on.

Dr. Perler’s test confirmed Dr. Herzfeld’s findings: I definitely needed surgery. My artery was almost completely obstructed by “echolucent” plaque—a type that can easily form clots, break off and cause strokes.

We discussed timing. Dr. Perler’s next surgery day was June 18. That would leave me four days to recover before the wedding. He warned that I would be “miserable” doing that. But his next surgery day after that wasn’t until June 27.

“You can safely wait until next week,” he said, “but I wouldn’t wait two months.” Then he added the words I remember most: “We’ll take good care of you.”

My wife and I decided on June 27—and headed to San Francisco for the wedding. It was an untraditional ceremony with no white veil or a parade of bridesmaids. Maddie wore a champagne-colored, beaded dress. I have never seen her so happy—except maybe when she was playing My Little Pony as a 6-year-old. I was simply happy to be there.

On the morning of June 27, Dr. Perler started operating at 7:30. Within two hours, he had cleared the plaque from my carotid artery. Later, he told me it was so clogged—about 99%—he couldn’t even detect a pulse in it.

When I woke up, I was relieved to see that my eyes and fingers all worked. I could think and speak clearly. I was even able to complain to the nurses about how lousy I felt.

I spent two days in intensive care, with my blood pressure surging at times. About two weeks after the operation, I felt pretty normal. I’ve resumed running and weight-lifting. I recently played golf for the first time since the surgery and feel great.

But mostly I feel lucky to have gotten a test that may have saved my life.

Getting Screened A national company, Life Line Screening, will do a carotid screen for $70, or with other tests such as for aortic aneurysms, for $149.

Hospitals’ accredited labs will do carotid ultrasound tests typically for $200 to $300, but usually only on a doctor’s order.

Insurers, private and government, generally will pay only if the patient has symptoms, including a mini-stroke.

The Society for Vascular Surgery’s site, vascular.org, can direct people to specialists who can do testing.

"In UCLA-led study, new treatment is more effective in people receiving immunotherapy for the first time

A UCLA-led study has found that a treatment that uses a bacteria-like agent in combination with an immunotherapy drug could help some people with advanced melanoma, an aggressive form of skin cancer, live longer.

The research showed that using the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab and the experimental agent SD-101, a sequence of nucleic acids that mimics a bacterial infection, altered the microenvironment around the tumor in a way that enabled the immune system to more effectively attack the cancer. The research was an early-stage study, conducted to test the side effects and best dosage of a potential new combined therapy, and the findings were published today in the journal Cancer Discovery.

Pembrolizumab, which is marketed under the brand name Keytruda, works by blocking a protein called PD-1, which interferes with immune system function. Blocking PD-1 with pembrolizumab enables the immune system cells to better attack the cancer. While pembrolizumab has been a significant advancement for treating people with a variety of advanced or metastatic cancers, a majority of metastatic melanoma tumors are still resistant to the drug.

""We have found that the reason patients with metastatic melanoma do not initially respond to immunotherapy with an anti-PD-1 is that their immune system was not ready,"" said Dr. Antoni Ribas, the study's lead author, a professor of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and director of the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center Tumor Immunology Program. ""So we thought, 'What if we change that by injecting the therapy drug into the metastatic lesions and change the microenvironment of the cancer?'

""It's like having a pile of wood but not having a match to light it. With this new approach, SD-101 is the match that starts the fire.""

The researchers found that SD-101 not only directs T cells to cancer cells, but it also makes the microenvironment more hospitable for the T cells, so that they can better kill the cancer cells.

All 22 people in the study had an advanced stage of inoperable or metastatic melanoma. Nine were receiving an immunotherapy treatment for the first time as part of the study. Seven of those nine had a positive response to the drug combination, including two for whom the tumors disappeared completely.

The other 13 people in the study had previously received a type of immunotherapy before the study. Of them, two had a partial response, meaning parts of the tumors shrank, but the tumors did not go away completely. Five more showed some reduction in the tumors, but the other participants did respond to the therapy.

The results of the study suggest that the combination of pembrolizumab and SD-101 could provide an alternative treatment for people with melanoma whose tumors have not responded or would be unlikely to respond to other therapies.

""For all patients with advanced cancer, immunotherapy using PD-1 inhibitors has really changed the face of cancer treatment. Unfortunately, this therapy still only works in a subset of patients,"" said Dr. Deborah Wong, assistant clinical professor of medicine at the Geffen School of Medicine and an oncologist at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, who was also an author of the paper.

""This particular combination has been especially gratifying because not only does the SD-101 therapy drug induce tumor shrinkage at the actual site where it's injected, but it's working in conjunction with pembrolizumab to shrink tumors outside of the ones we're directly injecting.""

The study highlights the need for more research into combination therapies like this one, because many people with cancer do not respond to immunotherapy or experience a reoccurrence of their tumors after treatment.

""We are really starting to understand the science of how immunotherapies work in patients,"" said Ribas, who is also the director of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy Center at UCLA. ""By understanding that, we can find more ways to make that therapy more active. One way is by combining the therapy with another agent that can overcome the resistance that some cancers have to these therapies.""

"DALLAS, Aug. 22, 2018 -- Breastfeeding is not only good for babies, there is growing evidence it may also reduce the risk for stroke in post-menopausal women who reported breastfeeding at least one child, according to new research in Journal of the American Heart Association, the Open Access Journal of the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association.

Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death among women aged 65 and older, and is the third leading cause of death among Hispanic and black women aged 65 and older, according to the study.

""Some studies have reported that breastfeeding may reduce the rates of breast cancer, ovarian cancer and risk of developing Type 2 diabetes in mothers. Recent findings point to the benefits of breastfeeding on heart disease and other specific cardiovascular risk factors,"" said Lisette T. Jacobson, Ph.D., M.P.A., M.A., lead author of the study and assistant professor in the department of preventive medicine and public health at the University of Kansas School of Medicine-Wichita.

This is among the first studies to examine breastfeeding and a possible relationship to stroke risk for mothers, as well as how such a relationship might vary by ethnicity.

Researchers analyzed data on 80,191 participants in the Women's Health Initiative observational study, a large ongoing national study that has tracked the medical events and health habits of postmenopausal women who were recruited between 1993 and 1998. All women in this analysis had delivered one or more children and 58 percent reported ever having breastfed. Among these women, 51 percent breastfed for one-six months, 22 percent for seven-12 months and 27 percent for 13 or more months. At the time of recruitment, the average age was 63.7 years and the follow-up period was 12.6 years.

After adjusting for non-modifiable stroke risk factors (such as age and family history), researchers found stroke risk among women who breastfed their babies was on average:

23 percent lower in all women,

48 percent lower in black women,

32 percent lower in Hispanic women,

21 percent lower in white women, and

19 percent lower in women who had breastfed for up to six months. A longer reported length of breastfeeding was associated with a greater reduction in risk.

""If you are pregnant, please consider breastfeeding as part of your birthing plan and continue to breastfeed for at least six months to receive the optimal benefits for you and your infant,"" Jacobson said.

""Our study did not address whether racial/ethnic differences in breastfeeding contribute to disparities in stroke risk. Additional research should consider the degree to which breastfeeding might alter racial/ethnic differences in stroke risk,"" Jacobson said.

Because the study was observational, it couldn't establish a cause-and-effect relationship between breastfeeding and lower stroke risk, meaning that it is possible some other characteristic that distinguishes between women who breastfeed and those who don't is the factor changing the stroke risk. However, because the Women's Health Initiative is large, researchers were able to adjust for many characteristics, and the effects of breastfeeding remained strong, Jacobson said.

""Breastfeeding is only one of many factors that could potentially protect against stroke. Others include getting adequate exercise, choosing healthy foods, not smoking and seeking treatment if needed to keep your blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar in the normal range,"" Jacobson said.

The study was also limited by the relatively small number of strokes that occurred during the follow-up period (just 3.4 percent of the women experienced a stroke during the study period and 1.6 percent reported having had a stroke prior to the study) and by the Women's Health Initiative's exclusion of women who had already had severe strokes at the time of recruitment.

Currently, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization recommend exclusive breastfeeding for six months, with continuation of breast feeding for one year or longer. For babies health, the American Heart Association recommends breastfeeding for 12 months with transition to other additional sources of nutrients beginning at about four - six months of age to ensure sufficient micronutrients in the diet.

"An international team of researchers has developed a simple laboratory score that is safer and faster at diagnosing patients who visit the emergency department with heart attack symptoms. The score, published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal), can also identify patients at risk of subsequent heart issues after discharge.

""We have developed a simple lab score that is superior to using cardiac troponin alone for the identification of patients at low and high risk for heart attack or death at emergency department presentation,"" say Dr. Peter Kavsak, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario. According to Professor Andrew Worster, also from McMaster University, ""This lab score may reduce both the number of blood tests and time spent in the emergency department for chest pain patients.""

Patients with chest pain symptoms require multiple blood tests over several hours before a diagnosis is reached. Previous studies using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin alone to rule out and rule in heart attacks have not consistently demonstrated sufficient safety to use in clinical practice.

In this international study, researchers from Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Germany combined common laboratory blood tests available at many hospitals around the world to create a single laboratory score, or clinical chemistry score, to diagnose heart attack. These blood tests are part of the World Health Organization's list of essential in vitro diagnostics tests for health care facilities with clinical laboratories.

The researchers validated the clinical chemistry score as a predictor of heart attack or death within 30 days using data on 4245 patients from emergency department studies in the four countries. Within one month of the emergency department visits, 727 heart attacks or death in patients occurred. A negative (or low-risk) clinical chemistry score at emergency department presentation missed only one of these events compared with up to 25 missed heart attacks/death when using a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin test alone. A positive (or high-risk) clinical chemistry score also identified about 75% of patients at high risk of heart attack or death when positive compared with a low of 40% detected when the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin test alone was positive. The clinical chemistry score worked equally well in men and women.

The authors suggest the score can be useful for standardizing diagnoses and improving safety.

""Adoption of the clinical chemistry score algorithm would standardize reporting of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin test results, how the tests are interpreted in the normal range, and represent an option less susceptible to both analytical and preanalytical errors. This could result in the safest laboratory approach for physicians to use at presentation in the emergency department,"" says Dr. Kavsak.

"Bottom Line: Lumpectomy plus radiation was associated with a small clinical benefit in reduced risk of breast cancer death compared with lumpectomy or mastectomy alone in women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a noninvasive early form of breast cancer.

Why The Research Is Interesting: Patients with DCIS are often treated with radiation after lumpectomy, although it has remained unclear whether this can reduce the risk of dying from breast cancer.

Who and When: More than 140,000 U.S. women who had DCIS between 1998 and 2014; this study compared lumpectomy plus radiation vs. lumpectomy alone, lumpectomy vs. mastectomy, and lumpectomy plus radiation vs. mastectomy

What (Study Measures and Outcomes): Use of radiation and/or extent of surgery (exposures); breast cancer mortality rates within 15 years (outcomes)

How (Study Design): This was an observational study. Researchers were not intervening for purposes of the study and cannot control all the natural differences that could explain the study findings.

Authors: Steven A. Narod, M.D., of Women's College Research Institute, in Ontario, Canada, and co-authors

Results: A small improvement in breast cancer survival was associated with radiation plus lumpectomy for DCIS. The absolute risk reduction was 0.27 percent, making it necessary to treat 370 women to save one life. Patients who had lumpectomy plus radiation had more local recurrences than the mastectomy patients but had fewer deaths.

Study Limitations: Some data were missing; investigators didn't have information on tamoxifen use; treatments in the study population weren't randomly assigned; and the possibility remains that the decision to undergo radiotherapy was associated with other favorable prognostic factors.

"LANSING, Mich. August 7, 2018 - Montmorency tart cherries may play a role in improving gut health, suggests a first-of-its kind human trial of nine adults combined with a parallel laboratory study published in the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry. An international team of scientists found that Montmorency tart cherries helped to positively impact the gut microbiome - a collection of trillions of bacteria and other microbes that live in the intestinal tract.

The microbiome has been the focus of multiple studies in recent years due to its potential role in maintaining digestive health, as well as its impact on immunity, heart health, blood sugar control, weight management and even brain health. The gut microbiome holds great promise, especially related to personalized nutrition, although the research is still evolving and larger, long-term human intervention studies are needed. However, the new study does suggest that Montmorency tart cherries can be added to the list of gut-friendly foods.

While previous studies on Montmorency tart cherries have ranged from heart health and exercise recovery to sleep, this is the first study to explore the potential gut health benefits. The researchers speculate that it may be due to the polyphenols (anthocyanins and other flavonoids) in Montmorency tart cherries, the varietal of tart cherries grown in the U.S. Polyphenols in plant-based foods are broken down by microbes to stimulate growth of good bacteria.

""Montmorency tart cherries were a logical food to study due to their unique composition of polyphenols, including chlorogenic acids,"" said principal investigator Franck Carbonero, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Food Science at the University of Arkansas. ""Our results suggest that the unique polyphenol mixture in tart cherries may help positively shape the gut microbiome, which could potentially have far-reaching health implications.""

Research Methodology

Researchers conducted both human and laboratory experiments to determine the impact of Montmorency tart cherries on the microbiome. In the human trial, nine healthy adults, 23-30 years old, drank 8 ounces of Montmorency tart cherry juice (from concentrate) daily for five days. These individuals were non-smokers and had not taken antibiotics (which can affect the microbiome) in the 12 weeks prior and during the study. Using stool samples, the participants' microbiome was analyzed before and after the dietary intervention, and food frequency questionnaires were used to evaluate their overall diet.

The laboratory experiments were set up to mimic the conditions within the human digestive system, specifically the stomach, small intestine and three regions of the colon, to study how polyphenols are broken down and absorbed. This process of breakdown and absorption can have a significant impact on the body's ability to use the beneficial bioactive compounds in plant-based foods. The researchers tested U.S.-grown Montmorency tart cherries, European tart cherries, sweet cherries, apricots and isolated polyphenols in each simulated region of the digestive tract. They analyzed changes in the mix of bacteria and how these bacteria helped digest the polyphenols over time.

Study Results

In the human trial, the microbiome was positively altered (primarily measured by the increase in good bacteria) after just five days of drinking Montmorency tart cherry concentrate, although there were strikingly different responses due to the participants' initial microbiome composition. Individuals who ate a more Western diet (low in fruits, vegetables and fiber) potentially had a lower ability to metabolize polyphenols, thereby reducing bioavailability and any potential health benefits in the tart cherries. Remarkably, in these subjects, instead of Bifidobacterium, Collinsella were the beneficial polyphenol-degrading bacteria stimulated. The individuals who ate a more plant-based diet, with higher intakes of carbohydrates and fiber, responded with an increase in Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium, presumably because of the specific combination of polysaccharides and polyphenols.

While more research is needed, these results suggest individuals consuming a more plant-based diet may have a mix of gut bacteria that responds more positively and/or rapidly to tart cherry consumption. Individuals consuming a more Western diet that is lower in carbohydrates and fiber may have a lower/different ability to metabolize polyphenols, thereby altering bioavailability and any potential health benefits.

The laboratory experiments found that pure polyphenols characteristics of tart cherries increased the amount of Bifidobacterium. However, when concentrated juices were fermented, this bifidogenic effect appeared to be leveled out by the larger increase of polysaccharides utilizing bacteria. Somewhat surprisingly, Carbonero said, chemistry analyses showed that tart cherries polyphenols were not completely converted to smaller phenolic metabolites, suggesting that the full diversity of bacterial species in the human gut is required for efficient breakdown of the polyphenols in tart cherries.

While the dietary intervention was based on a limited number of human volunteers and more research is needed to support these conclusions, the results help build the foundation for future research and suggest Montmorency tart cherries can play a role in positively shaping the microbiome and maintaining gut health.

Montmorency tart cherries are the most common variety of tart cherries grown in the U.S., and are available year-round in dried, frozen, canned, and juice forms - including juice concentrate, which was the form used in this human trial. Montmorency tart cherry juice concentrate can be mixed with water or other juices. It can also be consumed straight from the bottle or used as an ingredient in recipes, such as smoothies and other beverages.

"New trials of a breakthrough swallowable sensor have revealed the device is 3,000 times more accurate than current technology used to diagnose many gut disorders.

The findings show the revolutionary gas-sensing capsule developed by researchers at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, could surpass breath testing as the benchmark for diagnosing gut disorders, paving the way to solving previously undiagnosed conditions.

The vitamin pill-sized capsule, currently being commercialised by Atmo Biosciences, provides real time detection and measurement of hydrogen, carbon dioxides and oxygen in the gut. This data can be sent to a mobile phone.

Capsule co-inventor, RMIT's Dr Kyle Berean, said the second human trials have revealed information about gas production in the gut previously masked when measured indirectly through the breath.

""The rate of false positive and false negative diagnosis that breath tests give is a real problem in gastroenterology,"" Berean, who is also Chief Technology Officer at Atmo Bioscience, said.

""Being able to measure these biomarkers at concentrations over 3,000 times greater than breath tests is quite astonishing.

""Importantly this test is non-invasive and allows the patient to continue with their daily life as normal.""

Intestinal gases are currently used to diagnose disorders including small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and carbohydrate malabsorption.

Of the one-in-five people worldwide who will suffer from a gastrointestinal disorder in their lifetime, almost a third remain undiagnosed due to a lack of reliable tests available to gastroenterologists.

Study lead and capsule co-inventor Professor Kourosh Kalantar-zadeh said the results showed high sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio in measuring the concentration of intestinal hydrogen, providing valuable information at the site of intestinal gas production.

""This gives us confidence that our new technology could potentially solve many mysteries of the gut and help the large portion of the population who have not been able to find a useful diagnosis or treatment for their symptoms,"" Kalantar-zadeh said.

Findings from the first human trials revealed the stomach releases oxidising chemicals to break down and beat foreign compounds that are staying in the stomach for longer than usual. Such an immune mechanism has never been reported before.

This second paper made a direct comparison between measuring hydrogen production within the gut via the gas-sensing capsule and indirect measurement through breath testing.

Trials were conducted on nine healthy individuals in a blinded comparative study on absorbable versus fermentable carbohydrates.

Melbourne based start-up Atmo Biosciences is set to commercialise this revolutionary technology.

The trials were conducted with colleagues from Monash University. The findings have been published in the medical journal Alimentary Pharmacology and Therapeutics (DOI: 10.1111/apt.14923).

"Heart scans for patients with chest pains could save thousands of lives in the UK, research suggests.

The life-saving scans helped to spot those with heart disease so they could be given treatments to prevent heart attacks.

Researchers say current guidelines should be updated to incorporate the scans into routine care.

The SCOT-HEART study tracked more than 4000 patients who were referred to a hospital clinic with symptoms of angina - a condition that restricts the blood supply to the heart.

Half of the patients were given a scan called a computed tomography angiogram, or CTA, in addition to standard diagnostic tests.

After receiving the scan, the number of patients suffering a heart attack within five years dropped by 40 per cent, the study found.

The number of patients undergoing additional procedures increased within the first year but had levelled out by the end of the five-year period. This suggests that including the scans in routine care would not lead to a surge in costly tests or additional heart surgery, the researchers say.

Patients who are at risk of a heart attack are frequently diagnosed with a test called an angiogram. This involves inserting tubes into the body and heart to check the flow of blood and identify any obstructions that could pose a heart attack risk.

CTA scans enable doctors to look at the blood vessels from the outside the body, without the need to insert tubes into the heart. The scans are cheaper, quicker and safer than angiograms.

The study had previously found that around a quarter of patients had their diagnoses reclassified after receiving the scan, prompting new treatments in many cases.

This is the first study to look at the impact of the scans on long-term survival rates.

Lead researcher Professor David Newby, of the BHF Centre for Cardiovascular Science at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""This relatively simple heart scan ensures that patients get the right treatment. This is the first time that CT guided management has been shown to improve patient outcomes with a major reduction in the future risk of heart attacks. This has major implications for how we now investigate and manage patients with suspected heart disease.""

"A translational research team led by the National University of Singapore (NUS) has harnessed CURATE.AI, a powerful artificial intelligence (AI) platform, to successfully treat a patient with advanced cancer, completely halting disease progression. This new development represents a big step forward in personalised medicine.

In this clinical study, a patient with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (MCRPC) was given a novel drug combination consisting of investigational drug ZEN-3694 and enzalutamide, an approved prostate cancer drug. The research team successfully utilised CURATE.AI to continuously identify the optimal doses of each drug to result in a durable response, allowing the patient to resume a completely normal and active lifestyle.

""Dynamic dosing in cancer therapy is not commonly used. In fact, drug dosing changes in oncology are typically performed only to reduce toxicity. CURATE.AI uniquely modifies drug dosing to increase efficacy. Our clinical study has shown that dosing can profoundly affect the efficacy and safety of treatment. A patient's clinical profile changes over time. The unique ability for CURATE.AI to rapidly identify the drug doses that result in the best possible treatment outcomes allows for actionable, and perpetually optimised personalised medicine,"" explained Professor Dean Ho, Director of the Singapore Institute for Neurotechnology (SINAPSE) at NUS, who led the study.

Combating cancer with combination therapy

Combination therapy represents a cornerstone in modern cancer treatment. Using this approach, multiple drugs are used to attack the processes that support cancer growth. A primary objective when designing combination therapies is to achieve drug synergy, where the drugs work together to substantially improve efficacy.

While combination therapy has generally improved treatment outcomes such as overall survival for many cancers, it is predominantly given at both fixed as well as high doses.

Prof Ho added, ""Patients respond to chemotherapy differently from one another. Even a single patient's response to therapy can vary substantially over the course of treatment. In fact, many patients do not respond at all to the drug combination because the dosages, which can profoundly impact efficacy, are not suitable for them. Therefore, while fixed dose combination therapy represents a standard of care, it may also serve as a barrier to realising truly optimal and personalised medicine.""

Harnessing AI to continuously optimise combination therapy dosing

To overcome the challenges of conventional combination therapy, the NUS team of engineers developed the CURATE.AI platform, which uses the patient's own clinical data - such as their drug doses and corresponding changes to tumour sizes or levels of cancer biomarkers in the blood - to calibrate his or her unique response to treatment. This calibration is then used to create an individualised CURATE.AI profile, or map, that identifies the drug doses which enable the best possible treatment outcome at any given point in time.

""No two patients' profiles are alike, and as a patient's body and the cancer itself evolve during treatment, the CURATE.AI profile evolves as well, enabling the clinical and engineering teams to optimise care for the entire duration of treatment, an unprecedented advance for combination therapy,"" Prof Ho explained.

In this study, which was conducted at the UCLA Institute of Urologic Oncology for a period of over a year, a patient with metastatic prostate cancer was given ZEN-3694 and enzalutamide. Reducing the level of prostate specific antigen (PSA) in the patient's blood served as the primary biomarker to determine if the patient was responding to treatment. Computed tomography (CT) imaging of the cancer lesions monitored the extent of disease progression.

Initially, the doses of ZEN-3694 and enzalutamide were adjusted by the clinicians to better manage patient-reported quality of life. The patient's initial drug doses and PSA levels were then used to construct his personalised CURATE.AI profile. Remarkably, CURATE.AI subsequently identified a ZEN-3694 dose that was 50 per cent lower than the patient's starting dose of the drug prior to CURATE.AI analysis. Prospective dosage guidance by CURATE.AI resulted in the lowest PSA levels observed for the patient during the course of the study. As treatment progressed, slight increases in ZEN-3694 dosing resulted in clear decreases in PSA levels, also demonstrating its key role in suppressing the metastatic cancer. CT imaging of the patient's lesions showed that disease progression was halted as a result of CURATE.AI-guided combination therapy of both ZEN-3694 and enzalutamide. Patient care guided by CURATE.AI is currently ongoing.

""Using CURATE.AI to dynamically modify drug doses and successfully treat a metastatic cancer patient represents a landmark breakthrough for the use of AI to truly personalise patient care. This advance is expected to dramatically improve response rates for all combination therapies that are being developed for oncology as well as virtually all other diseases. We can also expect CURATE.AI to markedly reduce the costs of drug development,"" Prof Ho added.

Dr Allan Pantuck, the lead clinician of the study, added, ""With fixed dose therapy, patients are often switched to other drugs when they no longer respond to treatment. However, CURATE.AI has shown that patients can still respond to the therapies that have seemingly stopped working by continuously identifying the patient's optimal dosing parameters.""

""The implementation of CURATE.AI represents a game-changing shift in the way that combination therapy can be optimised at the single patient level, and we have shown that N-of-1 medicine can be a reality. We are excited that CURATE.AI could ultimately enhance patient accessibility to important new combination therapies, saving lives in the process,"" said Prof Ho, who is also from the Biomedical Engineering and Pharmacology departments at NUS, as well as a member of the Biomedical Institute for Global Health Research and Technology (BIGHEART) at NUS.

The research was conducted in collaboration with the University of California, Los Angeles, and Zenith Epigenetics. The findings were published in Advanced Therapeutics on 29 August 2018.

More clinical trials underway

CURATE.AI is applicable to all diseases and all patients, and a first generation of the platform was previously validated in the clinic for single drug optimisation in post-transplant immunosuppression. This new study demonstrates that CURATE.AI can optimise multi-drug regimens.

Multiple clinical trials using CURATE.AI-guided combination therapy for oncology and additional applications such as post-transplant immunosuppression are underway. In addition, patient recruitment for additional oncology trials in Singapore has been approved.

The CURATE.AI team expects to broadly deploy the platform for the prevention of transplant rejection, adult and paediatric cancers, cardiovascular medicine, diabetes management, infectious diseases, and many other applications.

"One single dose of cannabidiol, a chemical extracted from cannabis, decreases brain abnormalities in people with psychosis.

According to a study published Wednesday by King's College London in JAMA Psychiatry, cannidiboil, also referred to as CBD, acts in the brain to reduce psychotic symptoms. The chemical is a non-intoxicating compound found in cannabis.

Researchers examined participants who were experiencing psychotic symptoms, but had not yet been diagnosed with psychosis, as well as healthy patients. Some subjects with symptoms were given placebo, while others received a single dose of CBD. All the participants then underwent an MRI scan while performing a memory task that engages regions of the brain related to psychosis, a press release stated.

Results from the MRI scans showed that participants displaying psychotic symptoms had abnormal brain activity compared to healthy participants. However, those that had received cannabidiol showed decreased abnormal activity compared to those who received the placebo. These results suggest that CBD can help re-adjust brain function to normal levels.

The researchers aren't entirely sure how CBD works in the brain to reduce psychotic symptoms, but the results show that it has a therapeutic effect, according to the press release.

""The mainstay of current treatment for people with psychosis are drugs that were first discovered in the 1950s and unfortunately do not work for everyone,"" Sagnik Bhattacharyya, co-author of the study said in the release. ""Our results have started unravelling the brain mechanisms of a new drug that works in a completely different way to traditional antipsychotics.""

A previous King's College London study also discovered that the chemical has antipsychotic effects, and in June, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first medication made from cannabidiol to treat two rare forms of epilepsy."

A trial led by The George Institute for Global Health revealed that most patients - 70 per cent - reached blood pressure targets with the 'Triple Pill', compared to just over half receiving normal care.

With high blood pressure the leading cause of disease burden worldwide, it's expected the findings published in JAMA will change guidelines globally.

Dr Ruth Webster, of The George Institute for Global Health, said this was a major advance by showing that the Triple Pill was not only more effective than standard care, it was also safe. ""It's estimated more than a billion people globally suffer from high blood pressure with the vast majority having poorly controlled blood pressure. Our results could help millions of people globally reduce their blood pressure and reduce their risk of heart attack or stroke.""

The researchers tested an entirely new way of treating hypertension by giving patients three drugs, each at half dose, in a single pill for early treatment of high blood pressure. Traditionally patients begin treatment with one drug at a very low dose, which is increased over time with additional drugs added and increased in dosage to try to reach target.

Dr Webster added: ""Patients are brought back at frequent intervals to see if they are meeting their targets with multiple visits required to tailor their treatments and dosage. This is not only time inefficient, it's costly. We also know that many doctors and patients find it too complicated and often don't stick to the process. This new approach is much simpler and it works.""

The trial, which was conducted in Sri Lanka, enrolled 700 patients with an average age of 56 and blood pressure of 154/90 mm Hg.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either the combination pill or usual care - their doctor's choice of blood pressure lowering medication. The Triple Pill, consisted of the blood pressure medications telmisartan (20 mg), amlodipine (2.5 mg), and chlorthalidone (12.5 mg).

Compared with patients receiving usual care, a significantly higher proportion of patients receiving the Triple Pill achieved their target blood pressure of 140/90 or less (with lower targets of 130/80 for patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease).

At six months, 83 percent of participants in the Triple Pill group were still receiving the combination pill compared to the majority of patients in the usual-care group still receiving only one and only one third receiving two or more blood-pressure-lowering drugs.

Professor Anushka Patel, Principal Investigator of the trial and Chief Scientist at The George Institute, said this was big improvement. ""The World Heart Federation has set an ambitious goal that by 2025 there will be a 25 per cent reduction in blood pressure levels globally. The Triple Pill could be a low cost way of helping countries around the world to meet this target.

""This study has global relevance. While the most pressing need, from the perspective of the global burden of disease, is low-and middle-income countries, it's equally relevant in a country like Australia where we're still achieving only 40%-50% control rates for high blood pressure.""

The George Institute is now looking at strategies to maximise uptake of the study results. This includes examining the acceptability of the Triple Pill approach to patients and their doctors, as well as cost-effectiveness which will be important for governments and other payers to consider.

WEDNESDAY, Sept. 5, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Taking fish oil supplements during pregnancy might translate into healthier growth in children during their first six years of life, a new study suggests.

""This study highlights the fact that in utero exposure can have a profound effect on the fetus that lasts through childhood,"" said Dr. Jennifer Wu, an obstetrician-gynecologist from Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.

""For the past decade, the importance of fish oil and the omega-3 fatty acids have been stressed to patients,"" explained Wu, who was not involved in the study.

""The use of fish oil in the latter part of the pregnancy has an impact on bone and muscle mass. Though these children are larger, they do not have increased rates of obesity,"" Wu added.

In the study, the researchers followed 736 pregnant women in Denmark who took either fish oil or olive oil supplements daily from week 24 of their pregnancy until one week after they gave birth.

The children were assessed 11 times between birth and the age of 6 years. Those whose mothers took the fish oil supplements during pregnancy sustained a higher body mass index (BMI) from the age of 1 to 6 years.

However, the higher BMI was not due to a higher percentage of fat, but rather to higher percentages of lean muscle and bone mass, the researchers found.

At age 6, children whose mothers took fish oil supplements while pregnant had a 395 grams higher total mass, 281 grams higher lean mass and 10 grams higher bone mineral content than children whose mothers who took olive oil during pregnancy, the findings showed.

""The body composition at age 6 years in children given fish oil supplementation was characterized by a proportional increase in lean, bone and fat mass, suggesting a general growth-stimulating effect,"" the researchers, who were led by Hans Bisgaard, from the University of Copenhagen, wrote in the report.

However, the findings only showed an association and did not prove that fish oil pills caused healthier growth in children.

According to Dr. Jill Rabin, co-chief of the division of ambulatory care, Women's Health Programs-PCAP Services at Northwell Health, in New Hyde Park, N.Y., ""In pregnancy and beyond, adequate intake of fish is important for normal human development, and this paper certainly adds to the literature.""

But Rabin, who was not involved in the study, did add a few caveats about the findings.

The population studied was relatively homogenous, and ""the [body mass] findings were not the object of the study (wheezing or asthma in children was the primary objective), growth was a secondary finding,"" Rabin explained. ""Certainly, however, this solid paper adds to the literature and paves the way for additional research on this interesting topic.""

The report by Bisgaard and colleagues was published online Sept. 4 in the BMJ.

"REHOVOT, Israel, Sept. 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Nucleix Ltd., a leading cancer detection company, announced today positive results from a clinical study designed to evaluate its innovative Lung EpiCheck™, a blood test for early detection of lung cancer. The results will be presented in a poster presentation titled Lung EpiCheck ™ - Results of the Training and Test Sets of a Methylation-Based Blood Test for Early Detection of Lung Cancer at the IASLC 19th World Conference on Lung Cancer hosted by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, to take place on September 22-26, 2018 in Toronto, Canada.

In the study, blood was prospectively collected from 20 centers and 3 biobanks in Europe and Israel. The samples were used for detection of lung cancer with the Lung EpiCheck blood test. Lung EpiCheck was validated on this independent test set comprising 181 lung cancer cases and 141 current or former smoker controls. Results show specificity of 91% and a sensitivity of 74% with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 89%. These results demonstrated similar performance to the preceding training set results from 102 lung cancer cases and 265 current or former smoker controls.

In particular, in the non-small-cell lung carcinoma group (n=162), the most prevalent type of lung cancer affecting about 85% of lung cancer patients, Lung EpiCheck was able to identify correctly approximately 70% of patients. With a correct identification of 59% of stage I patients, 77% of stage II, 76% of stage III and 83% of stage IV patients.

In the small cell lung cancer group (n=13), Lung EpiCheck was able to identify correctly 92% of the patients, with a sensitivity of 100% in the limited stage, and 86% at the extensive stage.

""Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer worldwide due to the high incidence of the disease, and the low rate of diagnosis at early and more curable stages,"" stated Prof. Mina Gaga, the President of the European Respiratory Society (ERS) and a lead investigator in the study. ""Clearly, we must establish screening programs for lung cancer worldwide. At the moment, low-dose computerized tomography (LDCT) screening which has been shown to reduce mortality from lung cancer in the very large NLST study is only reimbursed in the US for high-risk individuals. LDCT screening is not reimbursed in Europe or most areas in the world while there is still a debate about its cost and safety. Screening is however necessary in order to identify lung cancer at early, operable, stages for the entire at-risk population so currently, not only CT screening but also methods of molecular screening are being tested. I am therefore very encouraged with the results of this study, showing that EpiCheck has the ability to identify both non-small-cell and small-cell lung cancer at early stages, with a high level of sensitivity and specificity. Such promising results combined with the simplicity of the test, could allow us to detect lung cancer at the early stages and hence improve 5-year survival from about 15% to about 50-70%. This will offer significant added value in the fight against lung cancer.""

""We are very excited to present the best published clinically validated results of a blood test for the early detection of lung cancer,"" said Opher Shapira, PhD, CEO of Nucleix. ""Furthermore, these results were validated prospectively in an independent cohort. Currently, early stage lung cancer can be detected either accidentally, when testing for other conditions, or by using low-dose CT scans, which are costly, carry associated risks such as high radiation, and are employed only for a very high-risk population. Early detection of lung cancer can be a game-changer in the fight against this devastating disease, and we are looking forward to begin extensive clinical trials in the US, Europe and China next year, in order to get the test to the market as soon as possible at an affordable price.""

About Lung EpiCheck

The Lung EpiCheck blood test is based on a proprietary molecular biomarker technology, which combines new biochemical assays and sophisticated algorithms. The technology is based on identification and analysis of subtle changes in DNA methylation patterns, a powerful tool for distinguishing between cancer and healthy cells and thus for detection of tumors in the body. Dying tumor cells release cell-free DNA (cfDNA) into the blood, where cancer-specific methylation changes can be detected at any disease stage. The Lung EpiCheck blood test detects changes in DNA methylation in 6 markers in cfDNA associated with lung cancer.

About Lung Cancer

Lung cancer is the deadliest and most common of all cancer types. It is estimated that there are about 1.8 million new cases of lung cancer annually worldwide and about 1.55 million die from the disease each year. The reason for the high mortality rate is that currently most cases are detected when the patient becomes symptomatic, which is usually at late stages of the disease. To date, there is no adequate screening process for the early detection of lung cancer, bringing 5-year survival rate to approximately 15%. In addition, there is a well-defined risk group for developing the disease – mostly smokers and former smokers above the age of 50. In the US, low-dose CT is available for screening of individuals 55-79 years old who smoked at least 1 pack a day for 30 years, which represent less than half of the lung cancer population. Therefore, a screening test aimed at the entire risk group to assist in the early detection of the disease is highly needed and can dramatically increase lung cancer survival.

"Medical marijuana can provide relief from symptoms from dozens of health conditions with minimal negative side effects, according to new research.

Two studies published recently in the journals Frontiers in Pharmacology and Medicine found that patients with health conditions such as chronic pain and insomnia saw ""statistically and clinically significant therapeutic benefits"" when they used medical cannabis, according to a press release from the University of New Mexico.

Researchers from the university studied data obtained through the Releaf App. This app, developed by several of the studies' authors, is ""the largest repository of user-entered information on the consumption and effect of cannabis use in the United States,"" the release states. It has almost 100,000 entries.

The app is designed to record how using marijuana corresponds to changes in the intensity of symptoms and any side effects a person experiences. It helps ""track and learn which types of cannabis, dosing and ingestion methods work best.""

The study published in Frontiers in Pharmacology found that users suffering from 27 different health conditions with symptoms ranging from seizures to depression reported a mean reduction in symptoms of 2.8 to 4.6 points on a zero to 10 point scale after consuming cannabis in various forms, including concentrates and topicals. People using the drug to treat anxiety- and depression-related symptoms reported more relief than people with pain symptoms.

In the second study, researchers examined how cannabis buds treated insomnia. Cannabis users on the Releaf App experienced a reduction of symptom severity of an average 4.5 points on a zero to 10 point scale. According to the study, people who consumed the drug via pipes and vaporizers experienced greater relief of symptoms, and those who vaped experienced fewer negative effects.

According to the release, data from the app showed that an overall 94 percent of cannabis users suffering from a variety of health conditions reported that the intensity of their symptoms was reduced after consuming the drug. Additionally, use of marijuana was associated with non-serious side effects.

""If the results found in our studies can be extrapolated to the general population, cannabis could systematically replace multi-billion dollar medication industries around the world. It is likely already beginning to do so,"" Jacob Vigil, co-author of the studies, said in the release."

"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Merck KGaA said that its immunotherapy Bavencio, jointly developed with Pfizer, delayed the progression of kidney cancer when used in combination with Pfizer’s Inlyta drug in a late-stage study.

The drug combination led to longer progression-free survival in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) when compared with a control group on older Pfizer drug Sutent, the German drugmaker said in a statement on Tuesday.

The trial will continue to show whether Bavencio plus Inlyta also prolongs patients’ lives.

While the company said the benefit was statistically significant, they did not specify the duration of progression-free survival.

"In an article on Popular Science’s website, Jay writes about her experience with pain and the next-generation way she’s finding relief.

She is hardly alone in her suffering. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, an estimated 25.3 million Americans, or 11.2 percent of U.S. adults, experience chronic pain. It can interfere with work and home life and leave patients debilitated, disabled and depressed. So it makes sense that Jay jumped at the chance to experience long-term pain relief with the help of a spinal-cord stimulator.

Jay lays out the hows and whys of spinal stimulation, and she paints a vivid picture of a life in agony, a journey that has included skeptical doctors, plenty of painkillers and unanswered questions about the future.

She also describes her path to spinal stimulation, how the device works with the body to short-circuit pain, and the many roadblocks to relief that patients face.

“Even for me, the battle is not over,” Jay writes. “Since this surgery I’ve actually had another disc herniate, complicating everything. My spine isn’t cured, and I still hurt all the time. But the pain is far more controlled, and I can function much better at my current level of discomfort.”

As the human and financial costs of the opioid crisis rise, spinal stimulation may become more popular, even though it’s expensive. Jay says she was lucky: Her insurance covered much of the six-figure bill for the procedure.

"A vaccine against the Zika virus could one day be used to fight the deadly brain cancer that claimed the life of Senator John McCain, according to a study in mice.

Researchers used a vaccine against the mosquito-borne virus to kill human glioblastoma brain cells which had been implanted into rodents.

Glioblastoma is the most common and fastest growing form of astrocytoma; tumors which start in the glial cells of the brain.

Currently, most people diagnosed with the condition die within two years. Doctors can try to treat glioblastoma with surgery to remove the cancerous cells, and blast them with radiation and chemotherapy. However, as the disease spreads, it becomes difficult to differentiate healthy brain cells from cancerous glioblastoma stem cells, and the condition is therefore almost impossible to completely remove.

Each year, glioblastoma kills around 15,000 adults in the U.S. The condition recently made headlines as the disease that killed senator John McCain at the age of 81. Symptoms include recurring headaches, loss of appetite, blurred vision, vomiting, shifts in personality and the ability to learn, seizures and the gradual loss of speech.

“Thus, development of an effective therapy to kill glioblastoma stem cells is urgently needed,” Dr. Pei-Yong Shi, professor of genetics at the University of Texas Medical Branch and author of the study published in the journal mBio told Newsweek.

As both the Zika virus and glioblastoma can affect the brain, the team hypothesized that the former could be harnessed to treat the latter.

In 2015, countries in the Americas, including Brazil, as well as parts of Africa, were hit by a public health crisis following outbreaks of Zika and its link to encephalitis, a condition where the brain becomes swollen.

The majority of Zika cases result in a mild fever, rash, aches and pains, conjunctivitis and a headache. But if a pregnant woman becomes infected, the virus can target neural progenitor cells in her fetus, putting the infant at risk of being born with microcephaly. This is where the head develops smaller than normal.

The study showed that a live-attenuated Zika vaccine (containing a weakened version of the virus that does not cause disease in humans) could selectively infect and kill human glioblastoma stem cells, explained Shi. That’s because glioblastoma stem cells have similar properties to neural stem cells.

To investigate whether ZIKV-LAV, a vaccine developed at the University of Texas shown to protect mice and non-human primates against the virus, could kill human glioblastoma stem cells, the scientists injected a combination of glioblastoma stem cells from two human donors and the vaccine into mice.

The animals dosed only with the stem cells developed tumors. But those injected with the combination lived to around 50 days, 20 days longer than the stem cell mice.

When the team sequenced the RNA (a molecule that helps with gene expressions) of glioblastoma stem cells exposed to the vaccine and then those which weren’t, they found the virus prompted an antiviral reaction in the exposed cells in what is known as an oncolytic response.

Before undergoing surgery, cancer patients could be given the Zika vaccine to ""let the viruses hunt down the GSCs [glioblastoma stem cells] and eliminate them,” said virologist Dr. Cheng-Feng Qin of the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences in Beijing, who worked on the study.

Shi said: “Scientists may turn the 'bad' side of a devastating pathogen—Zika virus—for potential cancer therapy.”

However, he cautioned any potential treatment which could emerge from the study is far from being rolled out.

“We still need to further improve the specificity of the cancer-killing ability, while retain the safety of the vaccine strain,” Shi explained. “For example, we need to make sure that the therapeutic vaccine virus does not infect and kill normal neurons in humans.”

Dr. Harry Bulstrode, brain tumor expert funded by the charity Cancer Research U.K. who is researching how Zika could be used to treat aggressive brain tumors, who was not involved in the study, told Newsweek: ""This study is another interesting piece in the jigsaw, but it is never going to demonstrate what we believe to be the really exciting properties of the virus. These are its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and to selectively infect and concentrate in the brain tumor stem cells left behind after surgery."""

"Evivo's quick and non-invasive test measures the presence of markers that indicate low or high levels of good Bifidobacterium , such as acetate and lactate. A stool sample containing high levels of these markers will be strong enough to change the test's liquid display from pink to yellow, indicating high levels of Bifidobacterium. The liquid will remain pink if a sample has low levels of acetate and lactate, indicating that Bifidobacterium is missing and that key nutrients from breast milk, human milk oligosaccharides (HMO), are being wasted. Evivo has commenced rigorous clinical trials with the prototype to demonstrate the results from infant stool samples.

Point-of-Care Diagnostic Expert Turns Focus to the Infant Gut

The development of the prototype is led by Dr. Bethany Henrick, Ph.D., Director of Immunology and Diagnostics for Evivo. With more than a decade of experience designing and creating rapid, point-of-care diagnostics, Henrick was formerly an integral part of the team that developed and optimized the world's fastest point-of-care HIV test in 2005.

""This is the first and only point-of-care screening test designed to identify infants that do not have enough Bifidobacterium levels to create a stable infant gut microbiome,"" said Dr. Henrick. ""With recent research indicating most babies born after 1980 do not acquire Bifidobacterium at birth, our ability to detect significant levels of Bifidobacterium gives pediatricians and parents an immediate indication of whether or not their baby has this beneficial gut bacteria that set them up for lifelong health.""

Identifying a Disappearing, Yet Critical Piece of Gut Health

Dr. Henrick's previously published findings, which are the basis for the Evivo test, show an inverse correlation between rising infant fecal pH, reduced acetate and lactate, and lower levels of beneficial Bifidobacterium, proving that the infant gut microbiome has been rapidly changing over the last three generations. In the past, babies acquired Bifidobacterium from their mother during childbirth, but due to the increased use of modern medical practices such as antibiotics, C-sections and formula feeding, nine out of 10 babies born in the U.S. today no longer acquire it. The generational loss of this good bacteria in the infant gut allows for potentially harmful bacteria such as E. Coli and Clostridia to thrive, which are linked to higher risk of short- and long-term health issues such as colic, eczema, allergies, diabetes, and obesity.

""Currently there is no way to easily determine whether a baby is colonized with healthy bacteria,"" said Mark Underwood, M.D., Chief of Neonatology at UC Davis Medical Center. ""The ability to quickly measure levels of Bifidobacterium in a stool sample would enable pediatricians to identify babies with low levels of these beneficial bacteria and take appropriate action.""

Evolve BioSystems' Evivo is the only baby probiotic clinically proven to restore Bifidobacterium to a baby's gut and reduce potentially harmful bacteria by 80 percent. In a landmark clinical trial, Evivo produced rapid, substantial and persistent stabilization of the infant gut microbiome, to help set a foundation for life-long health.

"The enlarged organ tugs apart the mitral valve, which controls blood flow from the left atrium into the left ventricle. The distorted valve functions poorly, its flaps swinging apart. Blood that is supposed to be pumped into the body backs up into the heart and lungs.

A vicious cycle ensues: The heart enlarges, so the mitral valve leaks. The leaky mitral valve makes the heart enlarge even more, as it tries to compensate, and heart failure worsens.

In the new study, a device called the MitraClip was used to repair the mitral valve by clipping its two flaps together in the middle. (The clip is made by Abbott, which funded the study; outside experts reviewed the trial data.)

The result was to convert a valve that barely functioned into one able to regulate blood flow in and out of the heart.

Until today, researchers were not sure that fixing the mitral valve would do much to help these patients. A smaller study in France with similar patients failed to find a benefit for the MitraClip.

But that research included many patients with less severe valve problems, the procedure was not performed as adeptly, and the patients’ medications were not as well optimized as in the new study.

In the new trial, 614 patients with severe heart failure in the United States and Canada were randomly assigned to receive a MitraClip along with standard medical treatment or to continue with standard care alone."

"(Reuters Health) - People struggling with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) might feel better with antidepressants or psychotherapy, a recent study suggests.

People with IBS typically suffer from chronic abdominal pain, gas, diarrhea and constipation. While some people improve with customized diets that avoid certain foods that trigger symptoms, this approach doesn’t help everyone and some emerging research suggests that the condition may also be influenced by processes in the brain.

For the current analysis, researchers examined data from 53 trials that compared the effects of antidepressants or psychotherapy, either alone or in combination, versus placebo treatments or “usual management” in people with IBS.

Rates of “no relief” were highest with placebo treatments. People were 34 percent less likely to have no relief from antidepressants and 31 percent less likely to get no relief from psychotherapy, the study found.

“One component of IBS is increased sensitivity to the functions of the bowels; simply summarized, this means either the nerves taking messages from the bowel to the brain are more sensitive or that the brain is more attentive or reacts in a more emotional manner to the normal messages arising in the bowel, or both,” said Dr. Michael Camilleri, a researcher at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science in Rochester, Minnesota, who wasn’t involved in the current study.

“Since there are really no medications to reduce the nerve sensitivity, some doctors give medications that modulate the function of the brain in the hope that this approach will reduce the ability to sense or emotionally react to the signals or messages arriving from the bowels,” Camilleri said by email.

Psychiatric conditions including depression, anxiety, and somatisation - physical symptoms thought to have psychological origins - are common among people with IBS, researchers note in the American Journal of Gastroenterology.

Although the use of antidepressants is common among IBS patients, psychotherapy is not, the study authors note.

One limitation of the current study is that the smaller studies used in the analysis had a wide variety of designs and methods for testing the success of treatment, researchers note. Another drawback is that these studies weren’t designed to prove how antidepressants or psychotherapy might directly improve IBS symptoms.

Still, a psychological evaluation may make sense for IBS patients because it’s possible their symptoms might be a byproduct of untreated depression, said Dr. Agnieszka Kulak-Bejda, a psychiatry researcher at the Medical University of Białystok in Poland who wasn’t involved in the study.

Antidepressants may work better for certain types of IBS, and the study findings also suggest that the type of medication may matter, Kulak-Bejda said by email.

A family of medicines known as tricyclic antidepressants were more effective at relieving global symptoms of IBS, the analysis found. But another family of medicines known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) was better than a placebo for easing symptoms like pain and bloating and improving quality of life.

“The decision to use antidepressants as a form of therapy should be taken individually,” Kulak-Bejda said. “The decision should be made after considering all the pros and cons.”

"Taking vitamin D could help overweight and obese children lose weight, scientists believe.

Vitamin D is most commonly associated with the development and maintenance of strong bones as the body needs it to absorb calcium. But recently emerging research suggests vitamin D deficiency could also be a contributing factor of obesity.

The World Health Organization describes childhood obesity as one of the most serious public health challenges of the 21st century, with an estimated 41 million children under the age of five falling into this category. Obesity puts children at greater risk of developing preventable conditions like heart disease and diabetes at a younger age, and suffering poor health later in life.

In what is believed to be the first study to investigate the links between vitamin D supplementation and the weight and health of obese children and adolescents, researchers from University of Athens Medical School and Aghia Sophia Children's Hospital, Athens, recruited 232 particpants.

The team measured participants' vitamin D levels, body fat percentage, as well as their markers of liver and heart function at the start of the study, and again 12 months later.

The researchers randomly assigned 117 children with supplements containing 50,000 IU vitamin D for six weeks, while the others acted as the control group.

Children who took vitamin D had a significantly lower BMI, the researchers found. They also had lower body fat, as well as healthier cholesterol levels.

Dr. Evangelia, associate professor pediatric and adolescent endocrinology at at the Medical School of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and lead author of the study, said: ""These findings suggest that simple vitamin D supplementation may reduce the risk of overweight and obese children developing serious heart and metabolic complications in later life.”

The findings are set to be presented at the 57th Annual European Society for Pediatric Endocrinology Meeting, and have therefore not yet been reviewed.

In their next investigation, the team will study whether vitamin D supplements can improve the health of obese children and adolescents who have been diagnosed with disorders linked to obesity, such as high cholesterol, high blood sugar levels, and high blood pressure.

""Although these initial findings indicate that vitamin D could be used in the treatment of obesity, there remains a lack of evidence on the safety and long-term effects of supplementation, particularly if there is no vitamin D deficiency,” said Charmandari. ""However, if your child is overweight or obese I recommend that you consult your primary care physician for advice, and consider having their vitamin D levels tested.""

Professor Mary Fewtrell, assistant officer for health promotion at the U.K.-based Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, told Newsweek: ""Although the effect sizes are not given, these outcomes are certainly positive. It's encouraging that a simple intervention could have these effects and this certainly merits further investigation to consider its potential impacts on vitamin D supplementation for children with obesity.""

Earlier this year, researchers in the Netherlands published a study indicating higher levels of belly fat are linked to lower vitamin D levels.

According to findings presented at the European Society of Endocrinology annual meeting in Barcelona, individuals with higher levels of total body and abdominal fat appeared to have lower levels of vitamin D.

Rachida Rafiq, the lead author of the study told Newsweek at the time: ""Our results are significant as vitamin D deficiency and obesity are very common problems in our society nowadays,"" she told Newsweek, and argued that it is an important potential relationship to explore.

""Future studies should explore what the underlying mechanisms are that explain this specific relationship between vitamin D and visceral adipose tissue."""	Vitamin D: Supplement Linked to Weight Loss in Overweight and Obese Children	2018-09-28 01:00:02	https://web.archive.org/web/20180928013732/https://www.newsweek.com/vitamin-d-supplement-linked-weight-loss-overweight-and-obese-children-1140838	story_reviews_00026	fake
"Washington, DC - September 18, 2018 - An international team of researchers has successfully deployed a Zika virus vaccine to target and kill human glioblastoma brain cancer stem cells, which had been transplanted into mice. In a study published this week in mBio®, an open-access journal of the American Society for Microbiology, the team shows that a live, attenuated version of the Zika virus could form the basis of a new treatment option for this fatal brain cancer.

Glioblastoma kills about 15,000 adults in the US each year and is currently incurable because patients experience a high recurrence rate of their cancer even after the standard treatments of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Scientists suspect this recurrence is due to cancer stem cells, called glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), which hide out in nearby brain tissue even after the combination of therapies.

""During the Zika epidemic, we learned that the virus preferentially infects neural progenitor cells in the fetus, and causes the devastating microcephaly seen in babies born to infected mothers,"" says Pei-Yong Shi, a virologist at University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. He co-led the current study with tumor biologist Jianghong Man of the National Center of Biomedical Analysis in Beijing and virologist Cheng-Feng Qin of the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences in Beijing.

""We made the connection that perhaps Zika virus could also specifically infect the GSCs,"" because these cells have similar properties to neural stem cells, says Man. In previous work, Shi and his collaborators at Washington University in St. Louis showed that Zika virus did indeed attack and kill GSCs grown in the lab dish and in a mouse model of glioblastoma. In addition, the Zika virus was much less efficient at attacking the differentiated, healthy brain cells. (image: transmission electron micrograph of Zika virus, NIAID)

""If we could find a way to specifically target those GSCs that are the source of recurrence, then that might provide an option to prevent recurrence or even a cure,"" says Qin.

The team's first objective was to determine if there was a safe way to use Zika virus in patients to attack the cancer cells. Shi's lab has developed a promising live-attenuated Zika vaccine candidate called ZIKV-LAV that had been shown to be safe, non-virulent, and effective in protecting against infection in mice and non-human primates. The ZIKV-LAV has a small deletion from the viral genome that prevents it from replicating itself efficiently.

When the team injected this ZIKV-LAV into the brains of mice, they saw no health effects on the mice, no weight loss, and no behavioral abnormalities such as loss of appetite, depression, lethargy, or self-injury. The mice also functioned normally in tests for anxiety and motor function.

Next, the team wanted to show whether the ZIKA-LAV could work to infect and kill human patient-derived GSCs in a mouse model. So they mixed GSCs from two different human patient donors with the ZIKA-LAV and injected the mixture into the brains of mice. Mice that got the injection of the GSCs only rapidly developed tumors. Mice that got the ZIKV-LAV injected as well saw a significant delay in tumor development. Co-implanting the virus along with the GSCs also prolonged the median survival time of the treated mice to around 50 days, compared to around 30 days for the untreated mice who received GSCs alone.

Qin says that perhaps in the future patients would be given the Zika vaccine at the same time as surgery to ""let the viruses hunt down the GSCs and eliminate them.""

Finally, the team investigated the cellular mechanisms that the modified Zika virus used to kill the GSCs. They took GSCs treated with the ZIKV-LAV and those GSCs not treated and sequenced all the RNA messages being expressed in these two cell populations. Comparing those profiles, the team found that in the treated cells, the virus triggered a strong antiviral response in the cells, which induced inflammation and eventually cell death.

Next, the team will work with clinicians to develop safety tests of the ZIKV-LAV in glioblastoma patients. They may also modify the Zika virus further to make it an even more potent cancer cell killing machine. For example, Man explains, the researchers could add an immune modulator as a 'cargo' in the viral genome. Then, once such a virus infects a cancer cell and kills it, the immune modulator would be released to alert and activate the patient's systemic immune system against the remaining cancer cells.

""As a virologist, I see that we should take advantage of the 'bad' side of viruses,"" says Shi. ""They should have a role to play in cancer treatment.""

"GALVESTON, Texas -Researchers from The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston found that testosterone replacement therapy may slow disease progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The paper is currently available in Chronic Respiratory Disease.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, is predicted by the World Health Organization to be the third-leading cause of illness and death internationally by 2030. Low testosterone is common in men with COPD and may worsen their condition. Men with COPD have shortness of breath and often take steroid-based medications for an extended time, both of which increase their risk of low testosterone.

""Previous studies have suggested that testosterone replacement therapy may have a positive effect on lung function in men with COPD,"" said Jacques Baillargeon, UTMB professor in preventive medicine and community health. ""However, we are the first to conduct a large scale nationally representative study on this association.""

The goal of the study was to find out whether testosterone replacement therapy reduced the risk of respiratory hospitalizations in middle-aged and older men with COPD.

Using the Clinformatics Data Mart, a database of one of the largest commercially insured populations in the U.S., Baillargeon and colleagues examined data of 450 men aged 40 to 63 with COPD who began testosterone replacement therapy between 2005 and 2014. They also used the national Medicare database to study data from 253 men with COPD aged 66 and older who initiated testosterone replacement therapy between 2008 and 2013.

""We found that testosterone users had a greater decrease in respiratory hospitalizations compared with non-users. Specifically, middle-aged testosterone replacement therapy users had a 4.2 percent greater decrease in respiratory hospitalizations compared with non-users and older testosterone replacement therapy users had a 9.1 percent greater decrease in respiratory hospitalizations compared with non-users,"" said Baillargeon. ""The findings suggest that testosterone replacement therapy may slow the progression of disease in men with COPD.""

"NEW YORK -- Treatment with a HER2-targeted therapeutic cancer vaccine provided clinical benefit to several patients with metastatic HER2-positive cancers who had not previously been treated with a HER2-targeted therapeutic, according to data from a phase I clinical trial presented at the Fourth CRI-CIMT-EATI-AACR International Cancer Immunotherapy Conference: Translating Science into Survival, held Sept. 30-Oct. 3.

Among 11 evaluable patients who had received more than the lowest dose of the vaccine, six (54 percent) had clinical benefit. One patient with ovarian cancer had a complete response that lasted 89 weeks, one patient with gastroesophageal cancer had a partial response that lasted 16 weeks, and four patients (two with colon cancer, one with prostate cancer, and one with ovarian cancer) had stable disease.

""Immunotherapy marshals the exquisite specificity of the immune system to destroy cancer, and some types may have potentially fewer side effects than traditional chemotherapy,"" said Jay A. Berzofsky, MD, PhD, chief of the Vaccine Branch at the Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland. ""We are using a vaccine approach to generate an immune response to HER2, which is found at high levels on and drives the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung, colorectal, and gastroesophageal cancers.

""Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine for HER2-overexpressing cancers,"" continued Berzofsky. ""We hope that one day the vaccine will provide a new treatment option for patients with these cancers.""

The patients' vaccines are individually customized by Berzofsky and colleagues using their own immune cells isolated from their blood. The blood-derived immune cells are modified in several ways in the laboratory. The final product, which is administered intradermally (between the layers of the skin), comprises patient-derived dendritic cells genetically modified with an adenovirus to produce parts of the HER2 protein.

Preclinical studies, which were previously published in the AACR journal Cancer Research, showed that this type of vaccine could eradicate large, established tumors as well as lung metastases in mice.

In the dose escalation portion of the phase I clinical trial, patients were injected with the vaccine on weeks 0, 4, 8, 16, and 24 after enrollment in the study. Among the six patients who received the lowest dose of the vaccine, 5 million dendritic cells per injection, no clinical benefit was seen. Among the 11 patients who received either 10 million or 20 million dendritic cells per injection, six had clinical benefit.

Adverse reactions were predominantly injection-site reactions that did not require treatment. No cardiotoxicity was seen.

""Based on the current safety and clinical benefit data, the dose of the vaccine was increased to 40 million dendritic cells per injection and the trial opened to patients who have previously been treated with a HER2-targeted therapeutic, including patients with breast cancer,"" said Berzofsky.

""Moving forward, we would like to investigate whether we can increase the proportion of people who benefit from treatment with the vaccine by combining it with checkpoint inhibitor therapy,"" he added.

According to Berzofsky, the main scientific limitation of the study is that it is a relatively small, phase I clinical trial with no placebo control. However, the approach is sufficiently promising to warrant additional trials.

"Pancreatic cancer is currently very difficult to detect while it is still resectable. A new blood test developed by researchers at Lund University in Sweden, Herlev Hospital, Knight Cancer Center and Immunovia AB, can detect pancreatic cancer in the very earliest stages of the disease. The results have been published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.

Due to diffuse symptoms, pancreatic cancer is usually diagnosed very late in the disease progression. Therefore, despite pancreatic cancer representing less than 3% of all cancer cases, more people currently die from it than breast cancer. By 2030, pancreatic cancer is expected to be the second deadliest type of cancer in the world.

""Our test can detect pancreatic cancer with 96% accuracy at stage I and II, while there is still the possibility of successful surgical intervention. There is currently no cure and few treatment options for advanced pancreatic cancer, which is the late stage when pancreatic cancer is usually diagnosed"", explains Carl Borrebaeck, professor at the department of Immunotechnology at Lund University.

The study used samples from patients in both Denmark and the US, at different stages of the disease.

The blood test is developed on a so-called antibody microarray that consists of hundreds of recombinant antibody fragments. These antibody fragments are specific for a number of immune-regulatory proteins, cancer-associated antigens, and so on.

Since the immune system is the first to respond to threats like complex diseases, such as cancer, autoimmune diseases and infections, the microarray was designed to mirror this early response. This provides information about the development of tumours long before being visible on CT or detected by ctDNA. From those hundreds of markers, 29 markers were selected to detect pancreatic cancer with 96% accuracy at stage I and II.

In the future, the screening method could be used to screen people who are at a higher risk of developing pancreatic cancer, such as those with a hereditary risk, newly onset diabetes patients and patients with chronic inflammation of the pancreas.

The next step has already been initiated, which is a large US prospective study for high risk individuals.

"Overweight people who used a new motivational intervention called Functional Imagery Training (FIT) lost an average of five times more weight than those using talking therapy alone, shows new research published today by the University of Plymouth and Queensland University.

In addition, users of FIT lost 4.3cm more around their waist circumference in six months - and continued to lose weight after the intervention had finished.

Led by Dr Linda Solbrig from the School of Psychology, the research involved 141 participants, who were allocated either to FIT or Motivational Interviewing (MI) - a technique that sees a counsellor support someone to develop, highlight and verbalise their need or motivation for change, and their reasons for wanting to change.

FIT goes one step further than MI, as it makes use of multisensory imagery to explore these changes by teaching clients how to elicit and practice motivational imagery themselves. Everyday behaviours and optional app support are used to cue imagery practice until it becomes a cognitive habit.

Maximum contact time was four hours of individual consultation, and neither group received any additional dietary advice or information.

Dr Solbrig, who completed the work as part of a PhD funded by The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) South West Peninsula, said: ""It's fantastic that people lost significantly more weight on this intervention, as, unlike most studies, it provided no diet/physical activity advice or education. People were completely free in their choices and supported in what they wanted to do, not what a regimen prescribed.""

The study showed how after six months people who used the FIT intervention lost an average of 4.11kg, compared with an average of 0.74kg among the MI group.

After 12 months - six months after the intervention had finished - the FIT group continued to lose weight, with an average of 6.44kg lost compared with 0.67kg in the MI group.

Dr Solbrig continued: ""Most people agree that in order to lose weight, you need to eat less and exercise more, but in many cases, people simply aren't motivated enough to heed this advice - however much they might agree with it. So FIT comes in with the key aim of encouraging someone to come up with their own imagery of what change might look and feel like to them, how it might be achieved and kept up, even when challenges arise.

""We started with taking people through an exercise about a lemon. We asked them to imagine seeing it, touching it, juicing it, drinking the juice and juice accidently squirting in their eye, to emphasise how emotional and tight to our physical sensations imagery is. From there we are able to encourage them to fully imagine and embrace their own goals. Not just 'imagine how good it would be to lose weight' but, for example, 'what would losing weight enable you to do that you can't do now? What would that look / sound / smell like?', and encourage them to use all of their senses.

""As well as being delighted by the success of the study in the short term, there are very few studies that document weight loss past the end of treatment, so to see that people continued to lose weight despite not having any support shows the sustainability and effectiveness of this intervention.""

Trisha Bradbury was one of the participants allocated to the FIT study, and she explains: ""I lost my mum at 60, and being 59 myself with a variety of health problems, my motivation was to be there for my daughter. I kept thinking about wearing the dress I'd bought for my daughter's graduation, and on days I really didn't feel like exercising, kept picturing how I'd feel.

""I've gone from 14 stone to 12 stone 2 and have managed to lower the dosage I need for my blood pressure tablets. I'd still like to lose a touch more, but I'm so delighted with the mind-set shift.""

Professor Jackie Andrade, Professor in Psychology at the University of Plymouth, is one of the co-creators of FIT, and she explains: ""FIT is based on two decades of research showing that mental imagery is more strongly emotionally charged than other types of thought. It uses imagery to strengthen people's motivation and confidence to achieve their goals, and teaches people how to do this for themselves, so they can stay motivated even when faced with challenges. We were very excited to see that our intervention achieved exactly what we had hoped for and that it helped our participants achieve their goals and most importantly to maintain them.""

"Evidence suggests it may not only be good for mind and body, but also for a long life

The consensus--one of the first of its kind--comes on the eve of the Ryder Cup, the biennial golf tournament between Europe and the US.

Amid a growing body of evidence on the health impacts of the sport, the consensus aims to help current and would-be players maximise the health pros and minimise the health cons of golf, and to guide policy-makers and industry leaders on how best to make golf more inclusive and accessible and so encourage more people from all walks of life to take up the sport.

The statement draws on a systematic review of the available published evidence (342 eligible studies) and discussions among an international working group of 25 experts in public health and health policy, and industry leaders.

Agreement was reached on 79 statements in three areas. These set out what is currently known about golf's associations with health; the factors that may help or hinder take-up of the sport; and a series of recommendations for golfers, industry leaders, and policy makers on how best to maximise its health benefits, promote sustainability, and widen participation.

The evidence shows that playing golf regularly is associated with longevity and reducing the risk factors for heart disease/stroke. And it can boost older people's strength and balance.

The sport is also associated with good mental health and improving the overall health of those with disabilities.

Compared with other sports, the risk of injury is moderate, but as it's an outdoor activity, golfers may be more at risk of skin cancer.

Golf is sociable, and gets people outdoors, connecting with nature. It can provide moderate intensity aerobic physical activity, and its health benefits are greatest for players (and spectators) who walk round the course rather than opt for a golf cart.

While around 60 million people play golf at least twice every year, the participant profile is quite narrow: players tend to be middle aged to older, male, of white European heritage, relatively well off, and living in North America, Europe, and Australasia.

And the sport is often perceived as expensive, male dominated, difficult to learn, and not a game for the young or those on the lower rungs of the social ladder.

This can put people off, says the statement. The sport needs to be more inclusive and welcoming of people from all walks of life and ethnic backgrounds, and any such initiatives should be supported, it says.

More people might be keen to take it up if golf were promoted as an enjoyable, lifelong outdoors activity that affords a sense of community and competitive challenge while providing some 'me time' as well as helping to fulfil recommended exercise quotas, says the statement.

And the sport can do its bit for sustainability by ""practices that prioritise diversity, healthy societies, connection with, and care of, the environment, environmental integrity and health and wellbeing,"" the statement suggests.

Among its raft of recommendations, the consensus statement says that:

Golfers

Should aim to play for 150 minutes/week, or do less, but couple golf with other physical activity, and walk the course rather than ride a golf cart

Do warm-up/strengthening exercises to cut the risk of injury and use sun-cream and wear collared shirts/blouses to minimise the risk of skin cancer

Make everyone feel welcome

Clubs/Industry should:

Build on existing initiatives to promote inclusivity and develop environments and price structures that will be attractive to everyone

Develop a culture that will inspire more women and girls to play golf

Make every effort to promote equality and diversity, and boost accessibility

Promote sustainability through wildlife conservation and by restricting the use of water, energy, and pesticides

Provide additional facilities at clubs, such as a gym, walking routes, crèches and improve the focus on health and safety, with the provision of healthy foods, defibrillators, and speed limiters on golf carts, for example

Policy makers should:

Promote the benefits of regular physical activity, including golf, for people of all ages, genders, and income brackets

Promote the specific health enhancing aspects of golf

Support diversity, equality, and sustainability

Work with industry and national associations to boost take up of the sport, particularly in groups where physical activity levels are low

Work with industry and regulatory bodies to get golf included in the Paralympics

""These outputs, if widely shared and adopted, will contribute to an improved understanding of golf and health, and aid these groups in making evidence-informed decisions and to improve health and wellbeing,"" the consensus statement concludes.

"A comparison of 2 of the most common combination therapies for locally advanced prostate cancer show the more aggressive option is linked with a higher rate of survival

(Philadelphia) - High-risk prostate cancer, that which has continued to grow but not yet metastasized, is commonly treated with combination therapies. Each method has pros and cons, but there is little clarity whether one might be more effective than the other. For the first time, researchers have shown that more patients live longer if treated with the combination of prostate removal plus radiation therapy. The research was published September 25th in the journal Cancer.

""There's a lot of debate about whether to remove the whole prostate and follow up with radiation therapy. Or, as a second option, to spare the prostate and treat it using radiation therapy plus hormone-blocking therapy,"" said senior author Grace Lu-Yao, PhD, Associate Director of Population Science at the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center - Jefferson Health, one of only eight NCI-designated cancer centers nationwide with a prostate cancer program of excellence. ""Our study suggests that removing the prostate followed by adjuvant radiotherapy is associated with greater overall survival in men with prostate cancer.""

The risks of prostate removal, or prostatectomy, are well known and include higher chance of developing incontinence and erectile dysfunction. There are some risks associated with radiation treatment and hormone therapy, but they are less common, and are typically thought to have a lower impact on quality of life. ""Prostatectomy is an unpopular treatment,"" said Lu-Yao. ""Our study showed that only six percent of men with high-risk cancer were treated with it."" It's not just the risk of side effects.For some men, especially those who are not fit enough for the surgery, prostatectomy is not an option. However, this may be an option for some patients to reconsider.""

In the largest population-based retrospective study to date, Dr. Lu-Yao and colleagues examined the records of 13,856 men in the Medicare-SEER registry diagnosed with locally advanced prostate cancer -- cancer growth that had not yet metastasized to distant sites in the body. Dr. Lu-Yao and colleagues looked at the patients who were treated either with prostatectomy plus adjuvant radiation as one group, and compared them to another group who were treated with radiation therapy plus hormone-blocking therapy. They matched the comparison groups by age, race and co-morbidity to control for factors that may influence patient outcomes, and analyzed which group did better 10 to 15 years after their procedures.

They found that 10 years after treatment, 89 percent of the prostate removal plus radiation group was still alive. That compared with the 74 percent survival at ten years in the group that received only radiation plus hormone therapy, amounting to a 15 percent survival advantage in the group that was treated with prostate removal.

""For high-risk prostate patients we started the use of aggressive radiation therapy after surgery 20 years ago,"" said Adam Dicker, Senior Vice President and Chair of the Department of Enterprise Radiation Oncology at Jefferson Health, who was not involved in the study. ""We recognized that it may have curative potential.""

""However, the proportion of men undergoing prostatectomy plus radiation therapy decreased significantly over time and there were trade-offs for the survival advantages,"" said Dr. Lu-Yao. Men who received the combination of surgery and radiotherapy had higher rates of erectile dysfunction (28 percent vs 20 percent) and higher rates of urinary incontinence (49 percent vs 19 percent).

Another interesting finding from the research was that slightly more than half of men diagnosed with the disease did not receive combination therapies for their prostate cancer. ""Two modes of treatment are recommended by both United States and European guidelines for cancer treatment. It was surprising to see only 29 percent of patients received the recommended combination therapies, and as many as 20 percent are not getting any treatment six months after their diagnosis,"" said Dr. Lu-Yao. ""Our data can't tell us the reason for this deviation from guidelines and further studies are needed.""

""One of the strengths of retrospective studies of patient data is that it reveals what happens in the real world, rather than the carefully controlled context of a clinical trial,"" said Dr. Lu-Yao. ""Our data is revealing the real-world practice as well as some of the advantages and disadvantages of those medical preferences.""

""This important study demonstrates that many men with high-risk prostate cancer derive a survival advantage through a multi-modality approach to their disease. Several large clinical trials are nearing completion that should validate these retrospective findings of the benefits of primary radical prostatectomy followed by additional therapies such as adjuvant radiation,"" said Leonard Gomella, Chair of the Department of Urology at Jefferson (Philadelphia University + Thomas Jefferson University), who was not involved in this research.

"Patients undergoing cancer treatment confront a number of well-documented side effects.

Chemotherapy and other cancer therapies can wreak havoc on the taste buds and olfactory senses, depriving recipients of the intricate interplay between taste and smell that is critical to grasping flavors and enjoying foods. Over time, taste and smell abnormalities (TSA) can lead to a loss of appetite and anorexic behaviors, compromising patients' ability to recuperate from the disease.

In a new paper published in the journal Food & Function, Virginia Tech College of Agriculture and Life Sciences researchers Susan Duncan and Aili Wang investigated the feasibility of lactoferrin, a highly bioactive protein found in saliva and milk, as a treatment for TSA. Their findings could bring relief to millions of patients undergoing cancer treatment.

""The underlying molecular mechanisms of TSA are not well-understood,"" said Duncan, associate director of the Virginia Agricultural Experiment Station and a professor in the Department of Food Science and Technology. ""The prevailing symptom described by patients undergoing chemotherapy is a persistent metallic flavor or aftertaste, with or without food intake. This can last for hours, weeks, or even months after the completion of treatments.""

As a consequence, cancer patients suffer poor appetite, weight loss, depression, and diminished nutrition, all of which are detrimental to recovery. Although TSA is widespread and a frequent complaint of cancer patients, until now, there have been no established therapies that reliably prevent or treat this problem.

""Our research shows that daily lactoferrin supplementation elicits changes in the salivary protein profiles in cancer patients - changes that may be influential in helping to protect taste buds and odor perception,"" said Duncan. ""By suggesting lactoferrin as a dietary supplement, we can reduce TSA for many patients, restoring their ability to enjoy foods during a time in which nutrition can play a key role in their recovery. This research could help us develop TSA-targeted biomarkers and strategies for improving quality of life during chemotherapy. Cancer patients and their supporting family and friends may again find comfort in enjoying a meal together. ""

The transdisciplinary team, including William Ray, Department of Biochemistry; Andrea Dietrich, of the Charles E. Via Jr. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering in the College of Engineering; and Glenn Lesser, from Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, previously identified the role of lactoferrin, a specific milk protein, in diminishing the metallic flavor stimulated by chemotherapy medications. The substance is well-known as a first-line defense, aiding the body's immune response, but little is known about its ability to impact salivary proteins. Their most recent study builds on the previous body of work through the application of lactoferrin supplements in treating taste and smell abnormalities.

The team's findings will make it possible for cancer patients to taste foods properly and to enjoy a healthier appetite, enabling more optimal nutrition during a critical period of recovery. Lactoferrin supplementation also enhances the expression of salivary immune proteins, which may help reduce oxidative stress and resulting side effects. Oral infections, such as thrush, also may be diminished.

SUNDAY, Sept. 30, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- It's a perfect case of the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

A potentially dangerous bacteria appears to target malignant cells and could provide a new means of fighting cancer, a small, preliminary study reports.

The bacteria, Clostridium novyi-NT, can cause gas gangrene and sepsis if infection is allowed to run amok in a wound.

But when injected into a tumor, Clostridium novyi-NT appears to both attack the cancer directly and encourage the body's immune response against the cancer cells, said lead researcher Dr. Filip Janku. He is an associate professor at the department of investigational cancer therapeutics at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, in Houston.

""Patients only had one week of exposure to the bacteria, but even with that limited exposure we saw quite interesting and, in some patients, clinically meaningful activity,"" Janku said.

Clostridium novyi has been linked to human illness. In 2000, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a handful of drug users in the United Kingdom fell ill or died after their injection sites became infected with the bacteria.

The strain used in this clinical trial, Clostridium novyi-NT, had been weakened to prevent it from producing its toxin, which can be lethal in humans, Janku said. The NT stands for ""non-toxic.""

Clostridium novyi flourishes in low-oxygen environments. Researchers thought this might make the bacteria a prime candidate for cancer fighting, by keeping the infection focused on the tumor site.

""Normal tissues, even if they are low on oxygen, they always have enough oxygen to not allow this bacteria to germinate and proliferate,"" Janku explained. ""Cancerous tissue is low in oxygen, most often in the center of the cancers.""

To test whether the bacteria could help fight cancer, researchers injected the tumors of 24 patients with a single dose of Clostridium novyi-NT, ranging from 10,000 to 3 million spores.

Fifteen of the patients had sarcoma, two patients had melanoma, and seven had a variety of cancers, the researchers said.

The scientists expected Clostridium novyi-NT to help fight the tumor in two ways.

First, the bacterial infection itself could cause direct destruction of the tumor cells, Janku said.

""If that happens, it actually helps to increase the presence of tumor-specific antigens, which are proteins that make a tumor more obvious to the immune system,"" Janku said. ""It can prime the immune system to attack the cancer.""

The bacteria also could activate the immune system to fight the cancer even if the infection didn't kill off tumor cells, Janku added.

Patients in this clinical trial were left with the bacterial infection for one week, and then everyone was given antibiotics to kill off the Clostridium novyi-NT, Janku said.

""Clostridium is actually quite susceptible to antibiotics,"" Janku noted.

The bacteria germinated in the cancers of 11 out of the 24 patients, with tumor cells dying off as a result.

Tumor shrinkage of greater than 10 percent was observed in 23 percent of patients. However, Janku said this could be an underestimate since the infection causes surrounding tissue to become inflamed, making the lesion appear larger than it actually is.

Following bacterial therapy, cancer stabilized in 21 patients. When both injected and uninjected lesions were included, the stable disease rate was 86 percent, the researchers reported.

The potential for Clostridium novyi-NT to prompt an immune response against cancer is intriguing, said Sacha Gnjatic, who is associate director of the Human Immune Monitoring Center at Mount Sinai in New York City.

""That's where the promise of this type of therapy lies. You would expect that the injected lesion would have some type of response because you're disrupting the tumor cells,"" Gnjatic said. ""What would be interesting is if this could prime an immune response that would eventually also take care of the non-injected tumors. That's the holy grail of immunotherapy.""

Janku said he's particularly excited by the ability of the bacteria to battle sarcomas, which are cancers that occur in bone, muscle and soft tissues.

""Classic immunotherapy which is now approved or being heavily investigated doesn't seem to be working for a majority of sarcomas,"" Janku explained.

Researchers have moved on to the next phase, in which patients taking the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab (Keytruda) will also be treated with a single injection of Clostridium novyi-NT, Janku said. The researchers suspect the two therapies used in combination will create a strong immune response against cancers.

However, they will have to keep an eye on potential side effects from Clostridium novyi-NT, Janku added.

Two patients treated with the heaviest dose of 3 million spores of Clostridium novyi-NT fell ill with sepsis and/or gas gangrene, leading researchers to set the maximum tolerated dose at 1 million spores.

Researchers also found the bacteria in the bloodstream of a couple of patients, meaning that the infection will need to be carefully tracked, Janku said.

""That didn't result in clostridium seeding anywhere else outside the injected region, but it's a theoretical possibility since we were able to detect it in the blood culture of one or two patients,"" Janku said.

Patients also could be susceptible to immune response side effects, such as low blood pressure or fever, he added.

The trial results were to be presented Sunday at the International Cancer Immunotherapy Conference, in New York City. The meeting is jointly sponsored by the Cancer Research Institute, the Association for Cancer Immunotherapy, the European Academy of Tumor Immunology, and the American Association for Cancer Research.

Research presented at meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

"Newswise — Baltimore, Md. Oct. 8, 2018 – The Maryland Proton Treatment Center (MPTC) is now offering deep-tissue external thermal therapy in combination with high-precision proton-beam radiotherapy as a potential way to boost survival chances for certain cancer patients. MPTC is the only center in the world to offer these two treatments at the same facility, an advantage to patients because these therapies are typically given within an hour of each other.

Research has shown that thermal therapy can be especially useful in difficult-to-reach cancers in the abdomen and pelvic region. Studies have found that adding thermal therapy to standard treatments can significantly shrink tumors and can improve survival for some patients. External thermal therapy, or hyperthermia – in the range of 104° up to 110° F. – sensitizes tumor cells to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In addition, heat has been shown to enhance anti-tumor immune response.

“We are very pleased to be able to offer deep-tissue thermal therapy, which can be combined with standard radiation therapy as well as proton-beam therapy to enhance the cancer-killing effects of the radiation,” says Zeljko Vujaskovic, MD, PhD, a professor of radiation oncology and director of the Division of Translational Radiation Sciences (DTRS) in the Department of Radiation Oncology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM).

“Early research suggests that adding thermal therapy to proton-beam therapy may be associated with an even greater benefit than when combined with standard radiation therapy, and we are excited to be at the forefront of making this combination therapy available to cancer patients,” says Dr. Vujaskovic, an internationally recognized expert in hyperthermic oncology.

Proton therapy is a precise form of radiation therapy that deposits all of its energy within the tumor and allows for less irradiation of noncancerous tissue. MPTC – which is affiliated with the University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center (UMGCCC) at the University of Maryland Medical Center – is the only proton treatment center in Maryland.

Radiation oncologists at UMGCCC already use external thermal therapy to treat a range of cancers, but do not currently use it for cancers that are deeper in the body.

According to Dr. Vujaskovic, the new deep-tissue thermal therapy equipment, which is made by Pyrexar, will be used to treat cancers of the abdominal and pelvic region, including cancer of the bladder, rectum, cervix, ovaries, pancreas and connective tissue, which are known as sarcomas. Patients would typically receive the thermal therapy two times a week for an hour before or after they receive standard (photon) radiation or proton-beam therapy.

The system heats the tumor tissue to 108° F. with internal and external probes that enable doctors to continuously monitor the temperature. A water-filled applicator is placed over the area to be treated, and non-invasive radio frequency energy is directed at the tumor. The heat causes the blood vessels in the tumor to dilate, bringing more oxygen into the tumor, which makes cancer cells more vulnerable to radiation therapy.

The acquisition of the deep-tissue thermal therapy system was made possible by donations from Jack and Emily Howell and the Middendorf Foundation, Inc.

“Within the Department of Radiation Oncology and throughout our cancer center, we strive to make every available tool in the cancer-fighting toolbox available to our patients,” says William F. Regine, MD, FACR, FACRO, the Isadore & Fannie Schneider Foxman Endowed Chair and Professor of radiation oncology at UMSOM and chair of radiation oncology at UMGCCC. “By continuing to develop a comprehensive thermal oncology program, we are giving patients more effective treatment options and therefore another reason to hope for better outcomes.”

“The Maryland Proton Treatment Center has achieved another milestone by becoming the first center to offer both deep-thermal therapy and proton therapy,” says E. Albert Reece, MD, PhD, MBA, Executive Vice President for Medical Affairs at UM Baltimore and the John Z. and Akiko K. Bowers Distinguished Professor and dean at UMSOM. “This achievement is a testament to Dr. Vujaskovic’s considerable expertise in hyperthermic oncology and leadership in developing an outstanding thermal oncology program at the University of Maryland. It’s this type of innovation that sets MPTC apart from other proton treatment centers.”

About the Maryland Proton Treatment Center

The Maryland Proton Treatment Center (MPTC) offers proton therapy – a highly advanced and precise form of radiation therapy that can increase radiation dose to tumor while decreasing dose to healthy, surrounding tissue – to the Baltimore/Washington region and beyond. It is a highly effective treatment for a wide range of localized tumors such as those found in the brain, base of the skull, head and neck area, eye tumors, tumors of the esophagus, lung, prostate, liver, breast, spinal cord, as well as gastrointestinal malignancies. It is also an important treatment option for children with cancer.

At MPTC, each treatment room is equipped with the most advanced form of “pencil beam” proton therapy, which essentially paints the radiation onto the tumor while stopping precisely at the site of the tumor. Proton therapy is performed on an outpatient basis and is a well-tolerated, non-invasive treatment that can reduce side effects. It can be used in conjunction with other modalities of cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and surgery. MPTC offers a robust clinical trial program to all its patients to further evidence-based medicine."

Two doses of Stelara, already approved for psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and Crohn’s disease, was tested in 961 patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (UC) who had failed prior therapy.

Both 6 mg/kg and 130 mg doses of the intravenous treatment showed clinical remission in significantly more patients, compared with those on placebo, after eight weeks, the company said.

The treatment and the placebo arms reported similar proportion of side effects, with one patient on the 6 mg/kg dose dying following excessive bleeding, J&J said.

The patient had no prior history of high blood pressure or cirrhosis, the drugmaker said.

“More than half of UC patients have not experienced remission with currently available treatment options,” the study’s lead investigator Bruce Sands said.

Stelara, which brought in sales of $1.34 billion in the second quarter of 2018, is also being tested in autoimmune disease lupus.

Ulcerative colitis, which affects about 38,000 people in the United States annually, is a chronic condition causing abdominal pain, intestinal ulcers, bloody diarrhea and weight loss.

Current treatments include Pfizer Inc’s Xelijanz, an oral treatment for adults patients with moderate-to-severe UC, and Merck & Co’s Renflexis.

TUESDAY, Oct. 16, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Stimulating a specific set of nerves that are nestled along the spine may deliver relief to those who suffer from chronic back pain and cut the need for opioid painkillers, new research suggests.

The therapy, which targets the root ganglion nerves, is more effective than other spine stimulation procedures because it places tiny leads precisely at the area where pain originates, unlike other devices that provide more generalized stimulation, the researchers said.

""In certain patients who have not gotten relief from other treatments, this therapy may give sustained pain relief and may allow them to reduce opioids for at least 18 months and perhaps longer,"" said lead researcher Robert McCarthy. He's a professor of anesthesiology at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago.

The dorsal root ganglions are nerve cells, on both sides of each of the spine's vertebra, and are the gateway to pain between nerves in different parts of the body, spinal cord and brain. Stimulating this area interrupts pain signals between the painful area and the brain, the researchers explained.

A pacemaker-like device implanted under the skin in the lower back sends small electronic pulses through a wire placed near the specific dorsal root ganglion associated with the pain, McCarthy said.

The pulses replace pain with tingling or numbness. The strength of stimulation, programmed by a doctor, is based on the patient's level of pain, he said.

The treatment has two advantages over spinal cord stimulation, McCarthy said. In spinal cord stimulation, a wire runs along the spinal cord sending pulses along the entire spine, but the pulses don't target the specific pain source.

In addition, dorsal root ganglion stimulation requires significantly lower levels of electric current to quell pain, McCarthy said.

The goal of this study, he said, was to judge the effectiveness of the therapy over a long period. McCarthy and his colleagues implanted the device in 67 people suffering with chronic back pain and followed them for three to 18 months. Among the participants, 17 had the device for over a year.

Before receiving the device, most patients rated their pain as an 8 on a scale of one to 10, with 10 being the worst. For most patients, the device reduced pain by 33 percent, which was significant, the researchers reported.

In addition, patients said they experienced a 27 percent reduction in disability or limitations on daily activities caused by pain. In all, 94 percent of the participants said the treatment was beneficial.

The procedure was not without complications. Five patients needed to have the wires implanted again, two patients had them removed because they were infected, and one had the device removed because of a complication.

McCarthy said the therapy is not widely available, even though it was approved by the FDA in 2016. At the moment, its use is confined to more advanced medical centers where doctors have been trained in how to implant and regulate the device.

Also, the procedure isn't covered by all insurance companies, so out-of-pocket costs to patients can be very high. It is, however, covered by Medicare, he said.

For uninsured patients, the cost of having spine stimulation devices can range from $15,000 to $50,000 or more, according to a 2008 report funded by the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries.

Spine stimulation is usually approved only after patients have not responded to other treatment, according to Blue Cross Blue Shield. Other insurance companies may have varying policies.

McCarthy hopes that more doctors will be trained in the procedure and that it will become more available, especially because it has the potential to allow patients to stop taking opioids to control their pain.

One pain specialist not involved with the study saw the benefits of this procedure.

""The results of this study are very significant,"" said Dr. Kiran Patel, director of neurosurgical pain at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.

It shows long-term data that patients experienced significant pain relief and functional improvements, she said.

""In my pain practice and career, dorsal root ganglion stimulation therapy has been one of the most effective technologies available to combat chronic pain,"" Patel said.

""I encourage chronic pain patients to seek out physicians who are trained and experienced in the application of dorsal root ganglion stimulation therapy to determine if they are a candidate,"" she said.

The findings were presented Sunday at the American Society of Anesthesiologists annual meeting, in San Francisco. Research presented at meetings is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

HealthDay Reporter

THURSDAY, Oct. 18, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- In what researchers are calling a ""breakthrough,"" two preliminary trials have found that either of two triple-drug regimens could potentially benefit 90 percent of people with cystic fibrosis.

The trials were short-term, finding that the drug combinations improved adult patients' lung function over four weeks. But experts said they were optimistic the results will hold up in the larger, longer-term trials already underway.

What's most exciting, they said, is that the triple-drug approach could open up new options to nearly all cystic fibrosis patients.

""This is not a cure for cystic fibrosis,"" stressed Dr. Steven Rowe, who led one of the trials. ""But it could be game-changing.""

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that causes persistent lung infections. Over time, extensive lung damage leads to respiratory failure. At one time, children with CF usually died before they reached school age. But with improved treatments, the typical life expectancy is now about 40 years, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.

Cystic fibrosis is caused by various mutations in a gene called CFTR. In the past several years, drugs that target those underlying genetics have become available. Known as CFTR modulators, they were heralded as a major advance in treating the disorder.

However, they work well only for a small number of people with certain CFTR mutations, explained Rowe, director of the Cystic Fibrosis Research Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

The most common mutation that causes cystic fibrosis is called F508del -- and it has proven tougher to tackle, Rowe said.

About half of people with CF carry two copies of the mutation (one inherited from each parent). For them, a combination of two existing CFTR modulators can ease breathing problems -- but the overall effects are only ""modest,"" Rowe said.

Then there's the 30 percent of CF patients who carry only one copy of F508del, plus another defect known as a ""minimal-function"" mutation. For them, the existing CFTR modulators do not work at all.

Both new trials focused on those two groups of patients. The results are published in the Oct. 18 New England Journal of Medicine, to coincide with the researchers' presentation at a North American Cystic Fibrosis meeting, in Denver.

Rowe's team tested a combination of two available CFTR modulators -- tezacaftor and ivacaftor -- plus an experimental one, known as VX-659. The other trial used the same existing drugs, along with a similar new drug, dubbed VX-445.

Rowe's team randomly assigned 54 adults with cystic fibrosis to either take the triple-drug regimen or be in a comparison group. In the comparison group, patients with one F508del mutation took placebo pills, while patients with two copies of the mutation took tezacaftor and ivacaftor alone.

After four weeks, the trial found, the triple-drug therapy had improved lung function in patients with both types of mutations. Their performance on a test called FEV1 rose by as much as 13 percentage points, on average -- what Rowe described as a ""pronounced improvement.""

The other trial had nearly identical results.

This is the first time, Rowe said, that CFTR modulator therapy has ""pushed the needle"" for patients with one F508del mutation.

An editorial published with the studies said they ""represent a major breakthrough.""

Now the questions are whether the improved lung function can be sustained, and whether the drugs prevent symptom exacerbations and other complications, wrote Dr. Fernando Holguin, of the University of Colorado, Aurora.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing both experimental drugs.

""The ability of these potential drugs to treat individuals with a single F508del mutation means that more people than ever before could benefit,"" said Dr. Michael Boyle, senior vice president for therapeutics at the foundation. ""This is very exciting news for our community.""

Rowe agreed there are still important questions about the triple-drug regimens. One is, how well do they work for younger patients?

Patients as young as 12 are included in the larger ongoing trials, Rowe said.

So far, the treatments appear safe. Most side effects in the four-week trials were ""mild to moderate,"" the researchers said, and included cough, headache and increased sputum.

If the experimental drugs are ultimately approved, there will be the real-world issue of price.

Vertex currently markets the combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor as Symdeko -- at a reported list price of $292,000 a year.

In the United States, more than 30,000 people have cystic fibrosis, according to the foundation.

"ZURICH (Reuters) - An experimental cancer drug that Novartis hopes will raise the profile of its oncology portfolio cut the risk of death or disease progression by more than a third in breast cancer patients with a hard-to-target gene mutation.

The Swiss drugmaker’s BYL719, a so-called PI3K inhibitor also known as alpelisib, combined with hormone therapy fulvestrant boosted median progression-free survival (PFS) to 11 months, up from 5.7 months for patients who got only hormone therapy, the company said on Saturday.

BYL719 plus fulvestrant cut risk of death or progression in those patients by an estimated 35 percent, Novartis said.

Novartis said earlier this year that this study, called SOLAR-1, of hormone receptor positive, HER2- breast cancer with mutations of the PIK3CA gene showed that YL719 helped patients.

But this specific benefit data is being released on Saturday at the European Society for Medical Oncology’s annual conference in Munich.

Even though PIK3CA mutations are the most common genetic change in hormone-receptor positive breast cancer, trials of agents seeking to put a brake on this pathway to tumor growth have largely disappointed including on safety issues.

Other drugmakers including Roche have seen similar investigational medicines stumble, making Novartis’s progress here hopeful news, doctors involved in the trial said.

“The results of SOLAR-1 are the most encouraging observed to date from a trial evaluating a PI3K inhibitor” for patients with this kind of breast cancer, said Fabrice Andre, a professor at France’s Institut Gustave Roussy.

“These data have the potential to allow physicians to address an unmet need in this patient population by using a biomarker-driven treatment to inform their sequencing decisions,” Andre added.

Like other companies, Novartis is seeking to personalize treatment for cancer patients by using biomarkers like those showing PIK3CA gene mutations to help guide treatment.

TALKS WITH REGULATORS

This week, Novartis signed a deal to have Roche unit Foundation Medicine provide genomic profiling of patient samples taken from Novartis’ clinical oncology trials. Other cancer drugmakers like Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck also have Foundation deals.

Samit Hirawat, head of Novartis’s cancer drug development, said in an interview the side-effects profile of alpelisib held up.

“We don’t see as much diarrhea, we do not have CNS (central nervous system) side effects, we do not have the liver effects,” he said.

Novartis plans to file with regulators for approval of the drug this year, Hirawat said, adding he also has strategies to broaden the indication, including tough-to-treat triple-negative breast cancer.

“PIK3CA mutations are present in many other tumor types,” Hirawat said. “There is a larger program we are putting into place.”"	Novartis drug cut death risk by 35 percent in gene mutation breast cancer	2018-10-20 16:33:04	https://www.reuters.com/article/us-esmo-novartis-breast-cancer/novartis-drug-cut-death-risk-by-35-percent-in-gene-mutation-breast-cancer-idUSKCN1MU0M9	story_reviews_00018	fake
"The first new flu drug in 20 years won approval Wednesday from the Food and Drug Administration.

The new antiviral, generically known as baloxavir marboxil but sold under the brand name Xofluza, is a single dose treatment. It is for use only in those aged 12 or more, the F.D.A. said, and should be taken only in the first two days after symptoms like fever, aches and sniffles appear.

The pill will cost $150, according to a spokeswoman for Genentech, which will sell Xofluza in this country. Genentech will offer coupons that lower the price to $30 for patients with health insurance and to about $90 for the uninsured.

Flu season has already begun, and last year’s was one of the most lethal in decades; about 80,000 Americans died of flu or its consequences, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said earlier this month .

The medication, called XOFLUZA, was designed to make the flu shorter if taken within 48 hours of onset and can be prescribed to patients 12 and older once they've been diagnosed with the illness, according to the FDA.

The new medication is designed to significantly reduced the duration of flu symptoms by more than one day, when compared to a placebo in clinical trials, the FDA said.

Researchers believe the medication will prevent patients from spreading the flu, which could help reign in contagion rates following the 2017-2018 flu season, which saw 900,000 hospitalizations and 80,000 deaths -- the deadliest season in four decades, according to the FDA. The medication was approved under a priority review.

The medication is the first in a new class of antiviral medications that blocks an enzyme within the flu virus, which stops viral replication early in the influenza cycle, the FDA announced.

XOFLUZA is similar to Oseltamivir, also known under the brand name Tamiflu, but ""decreases viral shedding faster"" and is associated with less side effects, Dr. Todd Ellerin, the infectious disease specialist at South Shore Hospital in Massachusetts, told ABC News.

""Like Tamiflu, it seems to work better the quicker it gets into the patient,"" Ellerin said.

In clinical trials, XOFLUZA demonstrated efficacy against a wide range of influenza, including Tamiflu-resistant strains, and has also proved effective against some strains of Asian bird flu, such as H5N1, according to the FDA.

The medication is the ""first new flu medicine"" of its kind -- with a novel proposed mechanism -- in nearly 20 years, said Dr. Sandra Horning, chief medical officer and head of global product development at Genentech, the company selling the pill in the U.S., in a statement to ABC News.

""If patients see their doctors within 48 hours of symptom onset, one dose of XOFLUZA can significantly reduce the duration of flu symptoms,"" Horning said.

Since it was tested in healthy, adult patients, it is unclear how effective it will be in the most severe cases or for the most vulnerable patients, Ellerin said.

"When it comes to preventing blood clots after a knee replacement, good old aspirin may be just as effective as newer, more expensive drugs.

That swap could help reduce the cost of caring for the nearly 1 million Americans who have a knee fixed each year, Michigan Medicine researchers say.

After knee surgery, there's a risk of blood clots in the legs or lungs. So it's routine for patients to take clot-preventing drugs for some time afterward.

Some doctors choose powerful anti-clotting drugs like heparin (Lovenox) and rivaroxaban (Xarelto), but it hasn't been clear whether these expensive prescription drugs work any better than cheap, readily available aspirin.

""Aspirin alone may provide similar protection compared to anticoagulation treatments,"" says Brian R. Hallstrom, M.D., an orthopaedic surgeon and associate chair for quality and safety at the University of Michigan Department of Orthopaedic Surgery.

Hallstrom is the lead author of a new study published in JAMA Surgery that found few patients developed a blood clot after surgery, and those patients on aspirin fared just as well as those on anticoagulants.

Aspirin use growing

During the two-year study period from 2013 to 2015, aspirin use rose from 10 percent to 50 percent among the patients cared for by orthopaedic surgeons in the Michigan Arthroplasty Registry Collaborative Quality Initiative, a statewide effort to give patients the best possible recovery and outcomes after hip and knee replacements.

Since then, the shift has become even more distinct: Aspirin prescribing has risen to 70 percent among Michigan surgeons, says Hallstrom, who is co-director of the initiative and a health services researcher at U-M's Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation.

Based on the experience of 41,537 Michigan patients undergoing knee replacement, the study may further the debate about the routine use of aspirin for clot prevention.

A recent Canadian study looked at the issue, but the analysis had a caveat: Each of the more than 3,400 clinical trial patients received rivaroxaban the first five days after surgery. After that, they continued with the drug or switched to aspirin.

The new U-M study suggests patients may be adequately protected if they take aspirin alone from day one.

""This study is truly a real-world experience of what happened in Michigan when the majority of surgeons switched to aspirin,"" Hallstrom says. ""The incidence of blood clots, pulmonary embolus and death did not increase despite this dramatic change in practice.""

Shifting procedure and dialogue

Over the past decade, surgeons have turned away from powerful anticoagulants and toward aspirin used in addition to nondrug improvements such as compression devices for thwarting clots.

These days, most patients have a generally low risk of blood clots after knee replacement for a number of reasons. Those reasons include shorter surgical times, less invasive procedures and use of regional anesthesia that allows early mobilization after surgery, Hallstrom says. Some patients are even going home the same day.

""The most important way to prevent blood clots is getting moving,"" says Hallstrom, noting that people are at risk for blood clots when they sit or lie in one position for too long, such as on an airplane or a hospital bed.

Still, pharmaceutical recommendations vary.

The critical care specialists who make up the American College of Chest Physicians favor heparin to reduce the risk of blood clots, while the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons guidelines state that no one drug is better than another for preventing clots.

Advantages of aspirin

The U-M study involved patients undergoing knee replacement surgery at any of the 29 Michigan hospitals in the surgical quality group. One-third of the patients took aspirin alone; 54 percent took only an anticoagulant; and 13 percent took an aspirin/anticoagulant combination.

Over three months, just 1.16 percent of aspirin patients developed a serious blood clot. That was true for 1.42 percent of anticoagulant patients, according to the Michigan study. This was not statistically different.

So, neither drug appeared better than the other -- but aspirin has some obvious advantages.

""Aspirin is easy to take and much less expensive,"" Hallstrom says. ""Patients can get it over the counter for pennies, while the other anticoagulants require monitoring, injections, frequent dose adjustments and are extremely expensive.""

The reported cost for a 30-day supply of rivaroxaban is approximately $379 to $450; heparin is estimated at $450 to $890. Although warfarin costs a few dollars for a 30-day supply, its cost approaches that of the other anticoagulants when doctor visits for monitoring are factored in, Hallstrom says.

In contrast, aspirin costs approximately $2 a month.

The study suggests most patients can have just aspirin without increasing the risk for venous thromboembolism, but doctors need to consider factors such as a patient's history of clots, obesity and ability to mobilize after surgery when determining the best measure for clot prevention, Hallstrom adds.

"LOS ANGELES (Embargoed Until Oct. 18, 2018 @ 10:05AM ET) -- A surgical technique called EDAS (encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis) significantly decreases the rate of stroke recurrence and death for patients with severe atherosclerosis of the brain arteries, according to findings of a Phase IIa clinical trial presented today at the World Stroke Congress in Montreal. Atherosclerotic disease, in which plaque buildup narrows the brain arteries, is one of the most common causes of strokes.

Neurosurgeons performing EDAS reroute arteries from the scalp and the membranes that cover the brain and place these arteries under the skull near areas of the brain at risk of stroke. Over time, new blood vessels form, creating fresh pathways for blood and oxygen to reach the brain.

The trial, led by Nestor R. Gonzalez, MD, professor of Neurosurgery and director of the Neurovascular Laboratory at Cedars-Sinai, enrolled 52 patients with severe brain atherosclerosis, also known as intracranial atherosclerotic disease, or ICAD, who showed symptoms of either a recent stroke or a mini-stroke, called a transient ischemic attack. These patients received EDAS surgery, along with intensive medical management, which included diet and lifestyle changes, blood thinners and other medications to control blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels.

After one year, 9.6 percent of the patients treated with the surgery experienced another ischemic stroke or died, compared with 21.2 percent of patients in a matched control group who received only intensive medical management. Two of the EDAS patients had small wound openings that required additional surgical interventions, but there were no intracranial hemorrhages or other serious adverse events, the researchers reported.

""Our findings in this intermediate-stage trial are promising for applying EDAS surgery to intracranial atherosclerotic disease,"" said Gonzalez said. Previously, EDAS has been used for moyamoya disease, a rare cerebrovascular disorder that affects younger patients.

Gonzalez said the new trial addressed a serious medical need. ""Even under the best current treatments, ICAD carries high rates of recurrent stroke and death, compared with other causes of stroke,"" he said. ""Developing new therapeutic strategies is crucial for ICAD patients.""

Current ICAD therapies--in addition to intensive medical management--include bypass surgery to connect a blood vessel from outside the brain to a vessel inside the brain, as well as angioplasty with stenting, which involves inflating a tiny balloon inside a cerebral artery to open it up and placing a stent device inside the artery. Despite advances in medical care, annual rates of recurrent stroke and death are remain high, at 15 percent or more for ICAD patients, according to published research.

Gonzalez said his team is working with the stroke prevention working group of the National Institutes of Health to develop a proposal for a Phase III randomized clinical trial across multiple institutions to further test the effectiveness of EDAS as compared with intensive medical management. While this Phase IIa trial selected patients from previous studies as the control group, the Phase III study would enroll new ICAD patients for both the control and experimental groups, he explained.

""This clinical trial moves us significantly closer to preventing strokes and death in high-risk populations,"" said Keith Black, MD, professor and chair of the Department of Neurosurgery. ""As a nationally renowned physician-investigator, Dr. Gonzalez personifies the dedication of Cedars-Sinai to translating the most advanced research into new cures.""

Besides Gonzalez, the trial involved other investigators from the stroke centers of Cedars-Sinai and UCLA.

"Data from a clinical trial has shown that how people respond to treatment for Bipolar Disorder may be influenced by their weight and the overall quality of their diet, including whether they are eating a diet high in foods thought to contribute to general inflammation. These are early results, but if replicated may mean that treatment of some mental health problems could benefit from the inclusion of dietary advice. This is presented at the ECNP Conference in Barcelona.

Bipolar Disorder (which used to be called 'manic depression') is characterised by episodes of mood swings, between being very up or very down with periods in between the two extremes. The fact that there are two opposite sets of symptoms means that finding an effective treatment is difficult. While current medications are useful, they are better at targeting mania symptoms (the 'up' phase), leaving a lack of effective treatment for people experiencing depressive episodes. Now a group of Australian, German and American scientists have shown those who have a high quality diet, a less inflammatory diet, and/or a low BMI (Body Mass Index) may respond better to an add-on nutraceutical treatment provided as part of a clinical trial.

""If we can confirm these results, then it's good news for people with Bipolar Disorder, as there is a great need for better treatments for the depressive phase of Bipolar Disorder"" said lead researcher Melanie Ashton of Deakin University in Australia.

A total of 133 participants were randomly assigned to take a combination of nutraceuticals (compounds derived from foods such as vitamins or minerals that treat or prevent a disease or disorder) including the anti-inflammatory amino acid n-acetylcysteine (NAC), or NAC alone, or a placebo (a dummy pill) for 16 weeks. Participants received the study medication in addition to any stable treatments they were already receiving. Researchers measured BMI at the beginning of the study, and then measured depression and how a person is able to function in their day to day life. Researchers also rated whether a participant was improving and, if so, how much, over the next 20 weeks. Participants filled in a questionnaire about what they usually eat over the year and researchers calculated a diet quality score, where good diets included a healthy diet with lots of fruit and vegetables, whereas poorer-quality diets had more saturated fat, refined carbohydrates and alcohol. These types of diets were then categorised as either anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory based on foods that affect inflammation.

Melanie Ashton continued, ""We found that people who had a better-quality diet, a diet with anti-inflammatory properties, or a lower BMI, showed better response to add-on nutraceutical treatment than did those who reported a low-quality diet, or a diet including foods that promote inflammation, or who were overweight.

What this means, if these results can be repeated in a larger trial, is that treatment for Bipolar Disorder would need to take into account what a person eats and their weight.

There are some points we need to note about this study. This is a randomised, controlled trial, but what we found were exploratory outcomes; in other words, it wasn't the main result that we were testing. Our result is statistically significant, but because the study wasn't specifically designed to test the effect of diet quality,

inflammatory diets and BMI on drug response in general, it is necessary to see the work replicated in a larger study before any firm conclusions can be formed"".

Commenting, Professor Eduard Vieta (Barcelona) said:

""This is interesting work, which holds out the possibility that patients with Bipolar Disorder may benefit from a balanced diet. However, it is an early study, and we need more research before we can think whether this might affect clinical practice"".

Professor Vieta was not involved in this work, it is an independent comment.

"New research from the University of British Columbia and the University of Saskatchewan is adding new evidence in support of midwives as a safe option for prenatal care, especially for women who have low socioeconomic status.

The study, published today in the British Medical Journal Open, found that low-income pregnant women who receive care from a midwife compared to a physician are less likely to go into early labour, to have a baby with a low birth weight, or to have a small-for-gestational age birth, meaning a fetus or infant that is smaller or less developed than normal for the number of weeks in pregnancy.

Midwives, general practitioners (GPs) and obstetricians (OBs) are all qualified to provide safe prenatal care for women during their pregnancy, labour and birth, but each offer a different style of care that matches different women's preferences and needs. Midwives are experts in the care of women having healthy pregnancies, and tend to spend more time with their patients with a focus on the overall physical, emotional and psychological wellbeing of mothers and their newborns.

""Our findings show that women who are more vulnerable benefit from the care of a midwife, likely because they receive more time, counselling and education on how to care for themselves,"" said the study's lead author Daphne McRae, a post-doctoral research fellow at the UBC school of population and public health who conducted the study while she was a PhD student at the University of Saskatchewan.

For the study, the researchers followed 57,872 women in B.C. who carried a single baby, had low-to-moderate risk pregnancies, and received medical insurance premium assistance sometime between 2005 and 2012. They used maternity, medical billing and demographic data to investigate the odds of small-for-gestational age birth, pre-term birth and low birth weight for low-income women receiving care from a midwife, GP, or OB.

After controlling for differences such as age, previous pregnancies, where they lived and pre-existing medical conditions, the researchers found that low-income women who were receiving prenatal care from a midwife had 29 per cent lower odds of a small-for-gestational age birth compared to women who received care from a GP. Compared to those who received care from an OB, low-income women receiving midwifery care had a 41 per cent reduction in odds for small-for-gestational age birth, the researchers found.

McRae said the findings add new evidence in support of midwifery care, and support the development of policies to ensure midwives are available and accessible, especially for low-income women. Midwifery is not available in all parts of the country.

""Waitlists for midwives can be quite long, so women who are educated and health-conscious typically access midwives early on in their pregnancies,"" said McRae. ""But more vulnerable women might not be as aware of the services available to them, so expanding midwifery to make it available for all women is important.""

""Our research could help develop policies that make the service more accessible to low-income women,"" added senior author Nazeem Muhajarine, a professor in community health and epidemiology at the University of Saskatchewan and McRae's supervisor while she conducted the research.

"Men who eat plenty of fermented dairy products have a smaller risk of incident coronary heart disease than men who eat less of these products, according to a new study from the University of Eastern Finland. A very high consumption of non-fermented dairy products, on the other hand, was associated with an increased risk of incident coronary heart disease. The findings were published in the British Journal of Nutrition.

Earlier studies have shown that fermented dairy products have more positive effects on blood lipid profiles and on the risk of heart disease than other dairy products. Examples of fermented dairy products include cheese, yoghurt, quark, kefir and sour milk. However, research into the topic remains scarce.

The Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study ongoing at the University of Eastern Finland explored the associations of fermented and non-fermented dairy products with the risk of incident coronary heart disease. Approximately 2,000 men participated in the study. Their dietary habits were assessed at the beginning of the study in 1984-1989, and they were followed up for an average of 20 years. During this follow-up, 472 men experienced an incident coronary heart disease event.

The study participants were divided into groups on the basis of how much they ate different dairy products, and the researchers compared the groups with the highest and lowest consumption, while also taking various lifestyle and nutrition factors into consideration.

When the study participants were divided into four groups on the basis of their consumption of fermented dairy products with less than 3.5% fat, the risk of incident coronary heart disease was 26% lower in the highest consumption group compared to the lowest consumption group. Sour milk was the most commonly used low-fat fermented dairy product. The consumption of high-fat fermented dairy products, such as cheese, was not associated with the risk of incident coronary heart disease.

However, the researchers found that a very high consumption on non-fermented dairy products was associated with an increased risk of incident coronary heart disease. Milk was the most commonly used product in this category, and a very high consumption was defined as an average daily milk intake of 0.9 litres. Lower consumption levels were not associated with the risk.

""Here in Finland, people's habits of consuming different dairy products have changed over the past decades. For instance, the consumption of milk and sour milk have declined, while many fermented dairy products, such as yoghurt, quark and cheeses, have gained in popularity,"" Adjunct Professor Jyrki Virtanen from the University of Eastern Finland says.

The new study provides further evidence on the health benefits that fermented dairy products may have over non-fermented ones. All the mechanisms are not understood yet, but they may be linked to compounds forming during the fermentation process.

"CLEVELAND, Ohio (October 8, 2018)--Microablative fractional CO2 lasers are energy-based devices designed to help manage troublesome menopause symptoms such as painful sex, dryness, itching/burning, urinary frequency, and incontinence. Although there is ongoing debate regarding the safety and effectiveness of vaginal laser surgery, a new study suggests that it may be effective, especially after multiple treatments. Study results are published online in Menopause, the journal of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS).

Collectively known as the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), the various genital and urinary problems associated with menopause have created a market for new therapies and treatments to help women regain sexual function and bladder control. Vaginal laser surgery represents one of the newer and more hotly contested approaches.

In the case of microablative fractional CO2 laser surgery, a series of microscopic laser beams using fractionated energy penetrate the skin to remove old and damaged skin cells, intended to rebuild the vaginal pathway. In this new study, GSM symptoms were evaluated up to12 months after the last laser surgery and compared based on the number of total therapies applied (up to a total of five).

The results of this small, retrospective, non-sham-controlled study demonstrated that this type of laser surgery was particularly effective in reducing the intensity of dyspareunia (painful sex) and dryness. It further demonstrated that four or five laser therapies may be superior in lowering the intensity of GSM symptoms compared with three laser therapies in both short- and long-term follow-up. Study results are published in the article ""Microablative fractional CO2 laser for the genitourinary syndrome of menopause: up to 12-month results.""

""This study adds to the literature on vaginal laser therapy for GSM. However, more robust randomized, sham-controlled data are needed, with larger numbers of women, to evaluate long-term safety, benefits, and risks,"" says Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton, NAMS executive director. ""Until more data are available, all treatment options, including lubricants, vaginal moisturizers, and FDA-approved vaginal and systemic hormone therapies, should be discussed with women who suffer from GSM to determine the best treatment option for them.""

"UK researchers behind a potential 'universal' liquid biopsy blood test for cancer detection have licensed the technology to an industrial partner to take it to market.

The research team believes that the test could be the first screening tool to 'rule in, or rule out' cancer in patients under suspicion of the disease, alongside other traditional diagnostics methods.

The test was developed at the University of Bradford, UK. It measures the damage to the DNA of white blood cells when subjected to different intensities of ultraviolet (UV) light, revealing measurable differences in the cells' susceptibility to further damage in patients with cancer.

The damage forms a 'comet tail' of DNA pieces that are pulled towards the positive end of an electric field. The longer the comet tail, the more DNA damage is present, which correlates with the presence of cancer. In a 2014 proof of concept study, the Bradford researchers showed they could identify which samples were from patients with three different types of cancer - even those who had yet to be diagnosed - with 93 per cent success.

However, in their two most recent clinical trials of the test involving over 700 blood samples from colorectal and prostate cancer patients (and further breast and lung cancer samples that were available), they were unable to distinguish those with cancer from healthy patients in 60 cases.

To determine whether scoring more cells on the slides would explain this 'challenging subgroup', lead researcher Professor Diana Anderson from the University of Bradford asked IMSTAR, to reanalyse the inconclusive slides. The Bradford team had scored 100 cells per slide, but the Pathfinder™ system is able to analyse up to 10,000 cells per slide, and uses Artificial Intelligence concepts in its proprietary software.

Scoring a minimum of 2,000 cells per slide, the IMSTAR Pathfinder™ system was able to separate all individuals of the cancer group from the healthy control group with confirmed statistical significance. These findings are published in FASEB BioAdvances journal.

Professor Anderson said: ""This test is different from other universal cancer tests being developed, because it is not looking for a specific biomarker or mutation. This is a generic test for cancer in an individual, regardless of the underlying mechanism that's causing their cancer.

""I'm now convinced that if we used the powerful IMSTAR system to look at thousands of cells on all the slide samples in the trials, we would see a significant increase in the overall predictability beyond the original 93 per cent of the original 2014 study.""

Paris-based company IMSTAR has now coupled the innovative technology developed at Bradford with their fully-automated Pathfinder™ cell reader-analyser to create a powerful and robust test for early detection, called TumorScan™.

Co-first author Dr Mojgan Najafzadeh from the University of Bradford said: ""We feel that we've taken it as far as we can in proving that the test works with high predictability for cancer outcome, and IMSTAR are the right partners to improve it still further.""

Dr Francoise Soussaline, PhD, DSc, IMSTAR's president said: ""To bring a universal 'liquid biopsy' blood test for cancer to market, it must achieve a number of criteria, including high sensitivity and specificity and be fully automated with high throughput for a medical routine use. In addition, test results must be available in 24hrs and at affordable cost.

""We believe that the combination of Bradford's innovation and IMSTAR's unique expertise has shown that TumorScan can achieve these requisites.""

IMSTAR's vice-president for medical applications, Dr Michel Soussaline, confirmed that the company will be working to automate the full test workflow further to take it to market.

"Scientists at the University of York have found a way of distinguishing between fatal prostate cancer and manageable cancer, which could reduce unnecessary surgeries and radiotherapy.

A recent study showed that more than 25 men were being unnecessarily treated with surgery or radiotherapy, for every single life saved. It is believed that success rates could be hindered as a result of treating all prostate cancers in the same way.

A team at the University of York and the University of British Columbia, Canada, however, have designed a test that can pick out life-threatening prostate cancers, with up to 92% accuracy.

Professor Norman Maitland, from the University of York's Department of Biology, said: ""Unnecessary prostate treatment has both physical consequences for patients and their families, but is also a substantial financial burden on the NHS, where each operation will cost around £10,000.

""Cancers that are contained in the prostate, however, have the potential to be 'actively monitored' which is not only cheaper, but has far fewer negative side-effects in patients with non-life threatening cancer.""

It is now understood that to find the different levels of cancer, scientists have to identify genes that have been altered in different cancer types. The team analysed more than 500 cancer tissue samples and compared them with non-cancer tissue to search for patterns of a chemical group that is added to part of the DNA molecule, altering gene expression.

A person's age, what they eat and how they sleep, for example, impacts on chemical alterations to genes and which ones are turned on and off. This is part of the normal functioning of the human body and can tell individuals apart, but the process can sometimes go wrong, resulting in various diseases.

Professor Maitland said: ""In some diseases, such as cancer, genes can be switched to an opposite state, causing major health issues and threat to life.

""The challenge in prostate cancer is how to look at all of these patterns within a cell, but hone in on the gene activity that suggests cancer, and not only this, what type of cancer - dangerous or manageable?

""To put it another way: how to do we distinguish the tiger cancer cells from the pussycat cancer cells, when there are millions of patterns of chemical alterations going on, many of which will be perfectly healthy?""

The team needed to eliminate the 'noise' of the genetic patterns that make individuals unique, to leave them with the patterns that indicate cancer. They were able to do this using a computer algorithm, which left the team with 17 possible genetic markers for prostate cancer.

Dr Davide Pellacani, who began these studies in York, before moving to the University of British Columbia, said: ""Using this computer analysis, not only could we see which tissue samples had cancer and which didn't, but also which cancers were dangerous and which ones less so.

""Out of almost a million markers studied, we were able to use our new tools to single out differences in cancer potency.""

To take this method out of the laboratory, the team are now investigating a further trial with new cancer samples, and hope to involve a commercial partner to allow this to be used for patients being treated in the NHS.

CHICAGO (AP) — It was launched decades ago as an anesthetic for animals and people, became a potent battlefield pain reliever in Vietnam and morphed into the trippy club drug Special K.

Now the chameleon drug ketamine is finding new life as an unapproved treatment for depression and suicidal behavior. Clinics have opened around the United States promising instant relief with their “unique” doses of ketamine in IVs, sprays or pills. And desperate patients are shelling out thousands of dollars for treatment often not covered by health insurance, with scant evidence on long-term benefits and risks.

Chicago preschool teacher Lauren Pestikas long struggled with depression and anxiety and made several suicide attempts before trying ketamine earlier this year.

The price tag so far is about $3,000, but “it’s worth every dime and penny,” said the 36-year-old.

Pestikas said she feels much better for a few weeks after each treatment, but the effects wear off and she scrambles to find a way to pay for another one.

For now, ketamine has not received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treating depression, though doctors can use it for that purpose.

Ketamine has been around since the 1960s and is widely used as an anesthesia drug during surgery because it doesn’t suppress breathing. Compared to opioids such as morphine, ketamine isn’t as addictive and doesn’t cause breathing problems. And some studies have shown that ketamine can ease symptoms within hours for the toughest cases.

Its potential effects on depression were discovered in animal experiments in the late 1980s and early 1990s showing that glutamate, a brain chemical messenger, might play a role in depression, and that drugs including ketamine that target the glutamate pathway might work as antidepressants.

Conventional antidepressants like Prozac target serotonin, a different chemical messenger, and typically take weeks to months to kick in — a lag that can cause severely depressed patients to sink deeper into despair.

Ketamine’s potential for almost immediate if temporary relief is what makes it so exciting, said Dr. Jennifer Vande Voort, a Mayo Clinic psychiatrist who has used ketamine to treat depression patients since February.

“We don’t have a lot of things that provide that kind of effect. What I worry about is that it gets so hyped up,” she said.

The strongest studies suggest it’s most useful and generally safe in providing short-term help for patients who have not benefited from antidepressants. That amounts to about one-third of the roughly 300 million people with depression worldwide.

“It truly has revolutionized the field,” changing scientists’ views on how depression affects the brain and showing that rapid relief is possible, said Yale University psychiatrist Dr. Gerard Sanacora, who has done research for or consulted with companies seeking to develop ketamine-based drugs.

But to become standard depression treatment, he said, much more needs to be known.

Last year, Sanacora co-authored an American Psychiatric Association task force review of ketamine treatment for mood disorders that noted the benefits but said “major gaps” remain in knowledge about long-term effectiveness and safety. Most studies have been small, done in research settings and not in the real world.

When delivered through an IV, ketamine can cause a rapid increase in heart rate and blood pressure that could be dangerous for some patients. Ketamine also can cause hallucinations that some patients find scary.

“There are some very real concerns,” Sanacora said. “We do know this drug can be abused, so we have to be very careful about how this is developed.”

Dr. Rahul Khare, an emergency medicine specialist in Chicago, first learned about ketamine’s other potential benefits a decade ago from a depressed and anxious patient he was preparing to sedate to fix a repeat dislocated shoulder.

“He said, ‘Doc, give me what I got last time. For about three weeks after I got it I felt so much better,’” Khare recalled.

Khare became intrigued and earlier this year began offering ketamine for severe depression at an outpatient clinic he opened a few years ago. He also joined the American Society for Ketamine Physicians, formed a year ago representing about 140 U.S. doctors, nurses, psychologists and others using ketamine for depression or other nonapproved uses.

There are about 150 U.S. ketamine clinics, compared with about 20 three years ago, said society co-founder Dr. Megan Oxley.

Khare said the burgeoning field “is like a new frontier” where doctors gather at meetings and compare notes. He has treated about 50 patients with depression including Pestikas. They’re typically desperate for relief after failing to respond to other antidepressants. Some have lost jobs and relationships because of severe depression, and most find that ketamine allows them to function, Khare said.

Typical treatment at his clinic involves six 45-minute sessions over about two weeks, costing $550 each. Some insurers will pay about half of that, covering Khare’s office visit cost. Patients can receive “booster” treatments. They must sign a four-page consent form that says benefits may not be long-lasting, lists potential side effects, and in bold letters states that the treatment is not government-approved.

At a recent session, Pestikas’s seventh, she leaned back on a reclining white examining-room chair as a nurse hooked her up to a heart and blood pressure monitor. She grimaced as a needle was slipped into the top of her left palm. Khare reached up with a syringe to inject a small dose of ketamine into an IV bag hanging above the chair, then dimmed the lights, pulled the window curtains and asked if she had questions and was feeling OK.

“No questions, just grateful,” Pestikas replied, smiling.

Pestikas listened to music on her iPhone and watched psychedelic videos. She said it was like “a controlled acid trip” with pleasant hallucinations. The trip ends soon after the IV is removed, but Pestikas said she feels calm and relaxed the rest of the day, and that the mood boost can last weeks.

Studies suggest that a single IV dose of ketamine far smaller than used for sedation or partying can help many patients gain relief within about four hours and lasting nearly a week or so.

Exactly how ketamine works is unclear, but one idea is that by elevating glutamate levels, ketamine helps nerve cells re-establish connections that were disabled by depression, said ketamine expert Dr. Carlos Zarate, chief of experimental therapies at the National Institute of Mental Health.

A small Stanford University study published in August suggested that ketamine may help relieve depression by activating the brain’s opioid receptors.

Janssen Pharmaceuticals and Allergan are among drug companies developing ketamine-like drugs for depression. Janssen leads the effort with its nasal spray esketamine. The company filed a new drug application in September.

Meanwhile, dozens of studies are underway seeking to answer some of the unknowns about ketamine including whether repeat IV treatments work better for depression and if there’s a way to zero in on which patients are most likely to benefit.

Until there are answers, Zarate of the mental health institute said ketamine should be a last-resort treatment for depression after other methods have failed.

"Artificial intelligence can be used to spot Alzheimer's six years before a patient would normally be diagnosed, a study shows.

Doctors used the self-learning computer to detect changes in brain scans too subtle for humans to see.

The system was able to identify dementia in 40 patients an average of six years before they were formally diagnosed.

British AI expert Prof Noel Sharkey, from the University of Sheffield, said of the findings: ""This is exactly the sort of task that deep learning is cut out for - finding high-level patterns in data.

""Although the sample sizes and test sets were relatively small, the results are so promising that a much larger study would be worthwhile.""

Boffins from the University of California trained the computer using more than 2,100 scans from 1,002 patients.

The scans measure brain activity by tracking the uptake of a radioactive liquid injected into the blood.

Research has linked the development of Alzheimer's to particular changes in certain brain regions but these can be difficult to spot.

The Alzheimer's algorithm was able to teach itself to recognize patterns in brain scans that indicated disease.

As a final test, it was given a set of 40 scans from 40 patients it had never studied before.

It proved to be 100 percent accurate at detecting Alzheimer's disease many years before the patient was later diagnosed.

Dr Jae Ho Sohn, who worked on the project, said: ""We were very pleased with the algorithm's performance.

""It was able to predict every single case that advanced to Alzheimer's disease.""

Early detection of Alzheimer's could open the door to new ways of slowing down or even halting the progression of the disease.

Dr Carol Routledge, from Alzheimer's Research UK, said: ""The diseases that cause dementia begin in the brain up to 20 years before any symptoms start to show, presenting a vital window of opportunity for us to intervene before widespread damage occurs.

""This study highlights the potential of machine learning to assist with the early detection of diseases like Alzheimer's, but the findings will need to be confirmed in much larger groups of people before we can properly assess the power of this approach.""

The research is published in the latest issue of the journal Radiology.

"(CNN) A five-minute neck scan could predict a person's risk of developing dementia a full decade before symptoms emerge, researchers have said.

The test, which analyzes the pulse of blood vessels in the neck, could become part of routine testing for cognitive decline, according to the study by scientists at University College London (UCL), who presented their work Sunday at the American Heart Association's annual scientific conference.

A group of almost 3,200 patients, aged 58-74, had ultrasounds on their necks in 2002, before having their cognitive functions monitored for up to 14 years, from 2002 to 2016.

People with the most intense pulses, which pointed to a greater and more irregular blood flow, were up to 50% more likely to suffer reduced cognitive functions, the research found, because the strength with which blood traveled into their brains caused damage to the brain's network of blood vessels.

Pulses become more intense when arteries near the heart are worn down -- usually by lifestyle factors such as poor diet and drug use -- and can no longer ""cushion"" the blood flow coming from the heart.

""If you can detect [the risk] in people in mid-life, it really gives an impetus to those people to change their lifestyle,"" said Dr. Scott Chiesa, post-doctoral researcher at UCL.

""What's good for the arteries is good for the brain,"" he added in summary of his findings. ""Dementia is not an inevitable cause of aging. How you live your life... has a real impact on how quickly your condition can decline.""

If the findings are confirmed by larger studies, they could vastly improve the ability to detect dementia in middle age.

And the scans would be ""well set up for routine testing,"" according to Chiesa. ""It's very easy to do, and it's very quick to do.""

When healthy, arteries around the heart can regulate the blood being pumped from the organ, ensuring that it flows smoothly and at a constant rate to the brain.

But damage to the arteries means blood flows more aggressively and irregularly through vessels and into the brain, which can damage its network of blood vessels and cells. Over time, the researchers believe this led more frequently to cognitive decline in participants in the study.

""What we do know is that the blood supply in the brain is incredibly important, and that maintaining a healthy heart and blood pressure is associated with a lower risk of developing dementia,"" said Carol Routledge, Director of Research at Alzheimer's Research UK, who was not involved in the research.

Vascular dementia is directly caused by reduced blood flow to the brain, and this can also play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease, studies have found. Those two conditions make up the vast majority of cases of dementia.

Dementia is an umbrella term used to describe symptoms related to the loss of brain function. Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia make up the vast majority of cases.

Around 50 million people suffer from dementia worldwide, according to the World Health Organization , with numbers projected to rise to 152 million by 2050.

In the United States, the condition is the sixth biggest cause of death among all adults, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while in the UK it has overtaken heart disease as the leading cause of death, according to the Office for National Statistics.

'Promising findings'

The study's findings have been met with cautious optimism by dementia organizations.

""Getting a diagnosis of dementia can be time consuming and quite frustrating for many people, so it's promising that earlier indicators of cognitive decline are in development,"" said Paul Edwards, Director of Clinical Services at Dementia UK.

But he added that focus should also be paid to dementia sufferers after their diagnosis, saying: ""The elephant in the room is the lack of support for people and their families once they get a diagnosis of dementia.""

There is currently no cure for dementia, though medication can be used to temporarily treat its symptoms.

""Often, a diagnosis is made and then people are sent home with no information, no follow-up appointments and no clue about what is going to happen next.""

Previous studies this year have linked dementia risk to lifestyle factors such as alcohol consumption and fitness level , but its effects remain largely incurable.

More research is needed to determine whether neck scans should become a part of routine testing for dementia.

""While these findings are interesting, as the full data from this research is yet to be published it is difficult to assess how useful this kind of scan could be,"" said Routledge.

Routledge added that current evidence shows that not smoking, only consuming alcohol within recommended limits, staying active, monitoring cholesterol levels and eating a balanced diet can all help with the health of the heart and brain."

(Reuters) - Merck & Co’s blockbuster drug Keytruda met the main goal of a late-stage trial testing the treatment in patients with cancers of the digestive tract, the U.S. drugmaker said on Wednesday.

Keytruda, among a class of medicines called PD-1 inhibitors, is Merck’s top selling drug and has already been approved to treat several forms of cancer including skin and lung cancer.

PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors work by blocking a mechanism of tumors that allows them to evade detection by cancer-fighting cells.

Keytruda, when compared to chemotherapy, enabled certain patients with esophageal cancer to live longer, helping the drug meet the main goal of the late-stage study, Merck said.

“This marks the sixth tumor type where Keytruda has demonstrated a survival benefit, and represents the first time an anti-PD-1 therapy has achieved overall survival for this patient population,” said Roy Baynes, chief medical officer of Merck Research Laboratories.

Esophageal cancer is the seventh most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world, the company said.

Merck said trial results would be presented at an upcoming medical meeting."

"(CNN) Sometimes, Ellis Glover would be forced to leave her friends and sit at a lunch table where no one was eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

""I wanted to sit with my good, good friends, but I couldn't,"" the 10-year-old said. ""If you're a kid and you have a food allergy, it's harder on you. You're missing out on a lot of stuff other children can have. I always want to try peanut stuff.""

Mom Monica Glover said the family discovered Ellis' peanut allergy when she was about 3. The tipoff: a skin reaction around her mouth after she was given food with a small amount of peanuts in it. ""We were lucky to have discovered it that way. That was a mild reaction,"" Glover said, and a doctor confirmed the allergy through tests.

The discovery was ""distressing,"" Glover said. Accidental exposure to peanuts has happened, resulting in ""severe stomach cramps and vomiting,"" she said. ""Essentially, we have to live in fear all the time of Ellis being inadvertently exposed to peanuts and having a reaction that is potentially life-threatening.""

Glover seized the opportunity to participate in a study on the safety and effectiveness of an experimental treatment that could give her daughter protection against accidental exposure to peanuts. Despite the risk, it was ""a gift,"" she said, adding that her family hoped their efforts might help ""lots of other children.""

The risk paid off: Two-thirds of the kids in the study were able to eat the equivalent of two peanuts without any symptoms after following the months-long experimental treatment regimen, the researchers found.

Ellis is one of the majority of children for whom the treatment works. ""It's been a huge success,"" her mother said.

The study results, published Sunday in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology's Annual Scientific Meeting, prove that the treatment can protect some children against accidental exposure to or ingestion of a very small amount of peanuts or peanut products.

Not a cure

Dr. Brian Vickery, the study's lead author, director of the Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Food Allergy Program and an associate professor of pediatrics at the Emory University School of Medicine, cautioned that ""it's not a cure.""

""It does not make the allergy to go away,"" Vickery said. ""The purpose is not to get them to be no longer peanut allergic and allow them to eat whatever they want.""

Still, that's no small accomplishment, he said. There are no US Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment options for food allergies of any kind or peanut allergy in particular, which, along with tree nut allergy, affects an estimated 3 million Americans or more.

""I'm telling patients when I see them that my hope is that patients will have access by late next summer, something like that,"" Vickery said. He added that although the study proved the treatment's effectiveness and safety only in children, adults would probably benefit in the same way.

How the study worked

To test the experimental therapy, 66 research centers in 10 countries recruited 551 participants who ranged in age from 4 to 55 and who all had a peanut allergy. Most -- 499 participants -- were between the ages of 4 and 17.

The treatment , which comes in powder-filled capsules, is an oral immunotherapy, and the concept is ""treating an allergy by gradually exposing people to the very same thing they're allergic to,"" Vickery said. Essentially, the treatment is a peanut powder.

Ellis participated in the study at the Pediatric Clinical Research Unit at Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock, which was overseen by Dr. Stacie M. Jones, a professor of pediatrics and chief of allergy and immunology at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and Arkansas Children's Hospital.

Ellis and Monica Glover in the Pediatric Clinical Research Unit at Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock.

""We were extremely well-informed about the entire process,"" Glover said. ""You start at a super low dose and work your way up. You take it at the hospital under observation. Then, you take it at home every day. ""

Three-quarters of the study participants were given the treatment in increasing amounts every two weeks until reaching maintenance, when they received the equivalent of one peanut daily. The remainder of the participants were given a placebo. At the conclusion of the study after a year, all of the participants faced an ""exit food challenge"": They ate, under a doctor's supervision, the equivalent of two peanuts.

Two-thirds of the treatment participants were able to tolerate this exit dose without a severe reaction. Half tolerated even twice that amount: a four-peanut dose.

Overall, participants experienced fewer side effects during the study than the researchers had anticipated. ""It's intuitive that that process would trigger some allergic symptoms in many patients,"" Vickery said. A third completed the study with no more than mild side effects, such as stomachache.

Ellis experienced stomach cramps and vomiting multiple times during the study, usually on days when her dose was increased to raise her tolerance. ""Having stomach cramps did not feel very good,"" she said. Still, she usually vomited, and the cramps passed quickly.

Once, she felt her throat constrict, and ""it was harder for me to breathe,"" she said. She'd gone into anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction. The hospital staff reacted immediately and gave her a shot of epinephrine. ""I felt safe with all the doctors and nurses around me. They can help you get through it,"" she said.

A little more than 11% of the children dropped out of the study due to severe side effects. Among children receiving the treatment, 10% required rescue epinephrine during the exit challenge, compared with 53% in the placebo group.

""These treatments really have the potential to transform people's lives,"" Vickery said, ""and I have seen it happen firsthand: the sense of relief [families] get when a child becomes desensitized.""

Trying to be 'bite safe'

Dr. Scott Sicherer, a professor of pediatrics and director of the Jaffe Food Allergy Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, said the study is ""the largest of the phase three studies in pharmaceutical-grade peanut.""

""It's what a lot of families call trying to be 'bite safe.' it's not that you're curing the allergy; it's not that you're going to be able to eat peanut butter sandwiches,"" said Sicherer, who was not involved in the study. ""It's really just to have a better threshold so that if you accidentally ate something that had a little bit of peanut in it, maybe you wouldn't have a reaction or the reaction wouldn't be so bad.""

Though the immunotherapy treatment is simply a matter of gradually increasing your tolerance to peanuts, you could have a severe reaction at home. ""This is not something to try at home,"" Sicherer said.

Aimmune has made peanut into a ""pharmaceutical-grade"" product, he said. ""Most people think of it as medicinalized food."" Doctors and patients both know exactly how much you're getting, he said, ""and that's important because if you're reactive to, say, a 50th of a peanut, you don't want to have a mistake where you're suddenly getting a 10th of peanut.""

Assuming the treatment wins FDA approval, Sicherer said, the conversation between doctors and patients will be, ""Is it better to just avoid the food and ask a lot of questions at restaurants and be real careful, or do something like this and still don't eat the food and ask the questions in the restaurant, but at least know you have a bit of a safety valve?""

There are more than a few caveats when it comes to the treatment regimen. For one, it's ""a commitment,"" he said. You cannot take a dose before exercising, and you can't skip doses, or you might have a severe reaction when you pick it up again.

Glover noted, ""It's somewhat disruptive. You have to do it every day. Generally, we would take it after dinner."" After giving the medicine, she added, parents must carefully monitor their children, preventing them from becoming too active or too hot.

Sicherer said, ""The family that does this really, really, really has to be a rule follower. It's not easy."" It would still be worth it to many, he said.

If this ends up being the first approved treatment, if it is covered by insurance and if details of whom it works for best were all worked out and the risks and benefits were clear, ""that would be so amazing, because we haven't really had anything like that before,"" he said.

""It's not everything we would hope for, but it's still fantastic to be able to raise someone's threshold from a teeny tiny amount of peanut to a couple of peanuts or more,"" said Sicherer, who believes that other allergy products will be developed in time: ""I can tell my patients that this might be the right thing for them, but if not, we're looking at things that might be easier and better down the road.""

Glover acknowledges that ""it's not a perfect solution. I would say it's been some work to go through this study, just in terms of a time commitment."" Still, if it had taken twice the amount of time, she would have done it: ""It's peace of mind.""

Even though she dislikes the medicine's taste, Ellis also believes it is worth it. ""It's definitely better,"" she would say to another kid with peanut allergy: ""You know you can be around your friends when they have peanut butter on them."""

"Scientists are inching closer to a drug that may protect peanut allergy sufferers from potentially life-threatening complications that can occur due to accidental consumption. While the drug is not being hailed as a cure for peanut allergy, it has proven successful in building up patients’ tolerance to peanuts over time, lessening the potential for life-threatening complications.

“We’re excited about the potential to help children and adolescents with peanut allergy protect themselves against accidentally eating a food with peanut in it,” said allergist Stephen Tilles, MD, ACAAI former president, study co-author and consulting advisor for Aimmune Therapeutics, according to EurekAlert. “Our hope when we started the study was that by treating patients with the equivalent of one peanut per day, many would tolerate as much as two peanuts. We were pleased to find that two thirds of people in the study were able to tolerate the equivalent of two peanuts per day after nine to 12 months of treatment, and half the patients tolerated the equivalent of four peanuts.”

The results, which were presented Sunday at the College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Annual Scientific Meeting and published in the New England Journal of Medicine, were based on study participants ranging in age from 4 to 55 years old. All participants, who mostly fell between ages 4 and 17, had a peanut allergy, but one third received a placebo while the rest were given a peanut protein powder that increased in dose over time.

Participants ingested the peanut protein under the supervision of a board-certified allergist as part of a process called an oral food challenge (OFC).

“Reactions from the oral challenges at the end of the study were much milder than prior to treatment,” Tilles said, according to EurekAlert. “On average, the participants were able to tolerate a 100-fold higher dose of peanut at the end of the study than they did at the beginning. In addition, the symptoms caused by the 100-fold higher dose at the end of the study were milder than the symptoms on the lower dose at the beginning of the study.”

EXPERTS: CHILDREN AT RISK OF LEAD POISONING IN CHATTANOOGA

With FDA approval this drug would mark the first treatment available by prescription for peanut allergies. The study’s authors noted that patients would need to stay on the drug in order to receive protection against the allergy.

“This is not a quick fix, and it doesn’t mean people with peanut allergy will be able to eat peanuts whenever they want,” Jay Lieberman, MD, vice chair of the ACAAI Food Allergy Committee and study co-author, said, according to EurekAlert. “But it is definitely a breakthrough. The hope would be to have a treatment available in the second half of 2019. If that happens, people who receive and are able to tolerate this treatment should be protected from accidental exposures."

An experimental vaccine that could hold off Alzheimer's disease showed promising results in animal testing, according to researchers at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.

Testing in mice showed that the vaccine safely prevents the buildup of substances in the brain associated with the fatal disease, the team reported this week in the journal Alzheimer's Research & Therapy.

There has been research in monkeys and rabbits as well, and the researchers hope the vaccine will progress to human trials.

If the vaccine proves safe and effective in humans, it could slice the number of dementia diagnoses in half, the study's senior author told USA TODAY.

More:The hidden side of dementia: Families fight over care, end-of-life decisions, finances, estates

Dementia is a term used to broadly describe symptoms of cognitive decline; Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia.

Doris Lambracht-Washington, a professor of neurology and neurotherapeutics at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, said researchers believe the vaccine could extend lives by preventing the disease from developing.

“If the onset of the disease could be delayed by even five years, that would be enormous for the patients and their families,” Lambracht-Washington said in a statement. “The number of dementia cases could drop by half.”

Lambracht-Washington said the study marks major progress toward a safe and effective vaccine.

Previous attempts to find an Alzheimer's vaccine either caused harmful side effects, such as brain inflammation, or used less effective approaches, she said.

The vaccine works by prompting the body to produce antibodies inhibiting the buildup of amyloid and tau, two proteins that are hallmarks of the degenerative brain disease.

The vaccine is one of several promising treatments aimed at reducing the buildup of those substances before they become deadly plaques and tangles in the brain.

HealthDay Reporter

TUESDAY, Nov. 27, 2018 (HealthDay News) --What if a simple zap to the spine could relieve the debilitating lower back and leg pain brought on by a herniated disk?

Such is the promise of ""pulse radiofrequency"" therapy (pRF), which sends inflammation-reducing pulses of energy to nerve roots in the spine, a new study claims.

The therapy is not new, having first received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval in the 1980s.

But recent advances in CT scan technology now enable clinicians to deploy those energy pulses with much more accuracy, experts said. And the new research suggests the treatment could prove a boon to back pain patients for whom standard therapies have failed to do the trick.

""I was amazed with the results of pRF,"" said study author Dr. Alessandro Napoli. ""Especially having read, as a radiologist, numerous lumbar MRI scans of patients with recurrent hernia after surgery.""

And as a patient himself, Napoli added that ""from personal experience I can tell you that the treatment is not painful, and the results are appreciated within days after a single treatment lasting 10 minutes.""

Napoli is a professor of interventional radiology at Sapienza University of Rome in Italy.

He and his colleagues plan to report their findings Tuesday at the Radiological Society of North America annual meeting, in Chicago. Such research is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

Lower disk herniation results when the insulating disks that sit between spinal vertebrae tear open, allowing jelly-like material to protrude and exert pressure on surrounding nerve roots. Beyond lower back pain, the condition often triggers sciatica, a pain that radiates down a patient's leg.

Standard therapies include over-the-counter pain meds, corticosteroid spinal injections, and/or invasive spine surgery that sometimes involves disk removal and vertebrae fusion.

The problem, said Napoli, is that such options entail risks without assured relief.

""Steroid injections are effective only in portion of the patients, and generally require more sessions,"" he noted. And though surgery safety has ""largely improved,"" Napoli pointed to the risk for bleeding and infection, the need for a minimum two- to three-day hospital stay, the high cost, and the fact that some patients ultimately realize little benefit.

By contrast, pRF is scalpel-free, delivering radio signals directly to affected nerves via a CT scan-guided electrode. The process, said Napoli, requires no hospital stay, is noninvasive, far cheaper and less risky.

""The rationale for using pRF on disk herniation is that we eliminate the inflammation process of the compromised nerve root,"" he explained. ""Without inflammation the pain fades, and the body starts a self-healing process that allows for complete resolution of the disk herniation in a large proportion of patients.""

For the study, the Italian investigators compared 128 lumbar herniation patients who underwent a single 10-minute round of CT-guided pRF with 120 patients who received one to three rounds of steroid injections.

All the patients had already undergone standard interventions, with poor results.

By the one-year mark following either treatment, a full ""perceived"" recovery was reported by 95 percent of the pRF patients, compared with just 61 percent of the steroid injection patients.

Dr. Daniel Park, director of minimally invasive orthopedic spine surgery at William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Mich., offered some caution on the findings.

He noted that because ""the majority of people with back pain improve with time and exercise alone,"" it remains an open question as to whether the pRF procedure really cured the condition.

Still, Park noted that diagnostic uncertainty can undermine the ability of surgery to get at the true source of a patient's pain, given that ""the problem with low back pain is that there are many causes of it, and physicians have trouble identifying the cause of pain.""

Nevertheless, he remains unsure if pRF is truly ready for prime time.

""Best case, I think [pRF] could be an option for people if they [have already] failed therapy and medication,"" said Park. ""It may be a similar option for people if they do not or cannot have steroid injections, but they need more treatment. I think this is experimental, and should not be first-line.""

"The age-old answer to inventing a cure for cancer hasn't quite happened yet, but science took another large leap forward. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Monday night it granted accelerated approval to Vitrakvi (larotrectinib), a treatment for adult and pediatric patients whose cancers have a specific genetic feature (biomarker).

This is the second time the agency has approved a cancer treatment based on a common biomarker across different types of tumors rather than the location in the body where the tumor originated.

In layman's terms — it means doctors and researchers can attack cancer at the root of biographical markers in a body, rather than focusing on one point where a tumor originated, like the breast, colon or other cancerous organ.

""Today’s approval marks another step in an important shift toward treating cancers based on their tumor genetics rather than their site of origin in the body,"" said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. ""This new site-agnostic oncology therapy isn’t specific to a cancer arising in a particular body organ, such as breast or colon cancer. Its approval reflects advances in the use of biomarkers to guide drug development and the more targeted delivery of medicine.

""We now have the ability to make sure that the right patients get the right treatment at the right time. This type of drug development program, which enrolled patients with different tumors but a common gene mutation, wouldn’t have been possible a decade ago because we knew a lot less about such cancer mutations.

The early beginnings of larotrectinib was studied in three clinical trials that included 55 pediatric and adult patients with solid tumors that had an identified NTRK gene fusion without a resistance mutation and were metastatic or where surgical resection was likely to result in severe morbidity, according to the FDA's statement. These patients had no satisfactory alternative treatments or had cancer that progressed following treatment.

Larotrectinib demonstrated a 75 percent overall response rate across different types of solid tumors. These responses were durable, with 73 percent of responses lasting at least six months, and 39 percent lasting a year or more at the time results were analyzed. Examples of tumor types with an NTRK fusion that responded to larotrectinib include soft tissue sarcoma, salivary gland cancer, infantile fibrosarcoma, thyroid cancer and lung cancer.

Vitrakvi received an accelerated approval, which enables the FDA to approve drugs for serious conditions to fill an unmet medical need using clinical trial data that is thought to predict a clinical benefit to patients. Further clinical trials are required to confirm Vitrakvi’s clinical benefit and the sponsor is conducting or plans to conduct these studies.

""Using our breakthrough therapy designation and accelerated approval processes, we support innovation in precision oncology drug development and the evolution of more targeted and effective treatments for cancer patients,"" the FDA stated. ""This is especially true when it comes to pediatric cancers. We’re committed to continuing to advance a more modern framework of clinical trial designs that support more targeted innovations across disease types based on our growing understanding of the underlying biology of diseases like cancer.""

Common side effects reported by patients in clinical trials receiving Vitrakvi include fatigue, nausea, cough, constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, vomiting, and increased AST and ALT enzyme blood levels in the liver.

Health care providers are advised to monitor patient ALT and AST liver tests every two weeks during the first month of treatment, then monthly and as clinically indicated. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not take Vitrakvi because it may cause harm to a developing fetus or newborn baby. Patients should report signs of neurologic reactions such as dizziness."	Cure For Cancer?

"Scientists from the University of Seville indicate that it can lessen the chronic pain, anxiety and depression that accompany this disease

Researchers from the Department of Pharmacology at the University of Seville have recently published a study in which they state that diets supplemented with aqueous extract of Annona muricata L. leaves can prevent the symptoms associated with fibromyalgia, so improving the lives of these patients.

Leaves of the species Annona muricata L. come from a tree of between 4 and 6 metres in height, from the botanical family Annonaceae. They are simple leaves, oblong and egg-like or oblong and elliptical in shape and between 5 and 15 cm in length. This species is native to the tropical areas of the Americas and is especially abundant in the Amazon region. It is usually cultivated for its medicinal use. The leaves have different ethnomedical uses according to their country of origin. The most important uses in traditional medicine, scientifically validated in pre-clinical tests, are for inflammation, pain, infections, diabetes and cancer.

""The consumption of extract of Annona muricata L. leaves in pharmaceutical form and in the correct dosage can reduce the chronic pain, anxiety and depression that accompany this disease. This extract comes from the traditional preparation using decoction"", informs the expert Ana María Quilez from the Medicinal Plants research group at the University of Seville.

This study was carried out over one month using 60 five-week old female rats in the laboratories of the Faculty of Pharmacy. The animals were divided into six groups that were fed a standard diet supplement with different quantities of this plant.

After the results obtained by the researchers, the next step will be to carry out clinical tests with patients, to corroborate the extract's activity and establish the safe and effective dose in humans.

This study was made available online in June 2018 ahead of final publication in print in October 2018.

"CHICAGO - A minimally invasive procedure in which pulses of energy from a probe are applied directly to nerve roots near the spine is safe and effective in people with acute lower back pain that has not responded to conservative treatment, according to a study being presented today at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA).

Lumbar disk herniation is a common, often debilitating, condition that affects the disks that act as cushions between the vertebrae of the lower spine. Herniation occurs where the jelly-like material in the center of the disk bulges through a tear in the disk's tough exterior layer and puts pressure on the roots of the nerves. Herniated disks are often the source of sciatica, or pain that radiates downward from the lower back into the leg.

Conservative treatment options for herniated disks range from over-the-counter pain medications to injections of corticosteroids directly into the affected area of the spine. Those who don't respond may require surgery. In some cases, the entire disk must be removed and the vertebra fused together for stability.

An alternative technique, CT-guided pulsed radiofrequency (pRF), applies energy through an electrode under CT guidance to the portion of the nerve responsible for sending pain signals.

""Pulsed radiofrequency creates a nerve modulation, significantly reducing inflammation and its associated symptoms,"" said study senior author Alessandro Napoli, M.D., Ph.D., professor of interventional radiology at Sapienza University of Rome in Italy.

Dr. Napoli and colleagues studied the approach in patients with back pain from lumbar disk herniation that had not responded to prolonged conservative treatment. In 128 patients, the pRF treatment was delivered directly under CT guidance to the root of the nerve. The treatment was applied for 10 minutes.

For comparison, a group of 120 patients received one to three sessions of CT-guided steroid injection on the same anatomical target with no pRF.

The one-year outcomes demonstrated that CT-guided pRF was superior to the injection-only strategy. Patients who received pRF saw greater overall improvement in pain and disability scores during the first year. Relief of leg pain was faster in patients assigned to pRF, and they also reported a faster rate of perceived recovery. The probability of perceived recovery after one year of follow-up was 95 percent in the pRF group, compared with 61 percent in the injection only group.

""Given our study results, we offer pulsed radiofrequency to patients with herniated disk and sciatic nerve compression whose symptoms do not benefit from conservative therapy,"" Dr. Napoli said.

The results of the study are superior to those typically reported for usual care strategies and injections and may help a substantial number of patients with sciatic disk compression to avoid surgery, Dr. Napoli added.

The use of pRF also could improve outcomes for patients set to receive corticosteroid injections.

""We learned that when pulsed radiofrequency is followed by steroid injection, the result is longer lasting and more efficacious than injection only,"" Dr. Napoli said. ""The effect of pulsed radiofrequency is fast and without adverse events.""

Today, therapy for spine disorders allows for definitive treatment of symptoms and conditions using different techniques and technologies.

""Of the different therapies available, pulsed radiofrequency is among the least invasive,"" Dr. Napoli said. ""Treatment lasts 10 minutes, and one session was enough in a large number of treated patients.""

"CHAPEL HILL - University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center researchers have found that mailing self-collection kits to test for high-risk human papillomavirus infection has the potential to boost cervical cancer screening - especially for low-income women who are overdue for testing.

In the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology, researchers published the results of mailing at-home, HPV self-collection kits to 193 low-income women in North Carolina who were overdue for screening according to national guidelines. They reported this screening approach detected high-risk HPV in all of the cases of women who were found to have high-grade, abnormal cervical precancerous growths, showing that self-collection at home for HPV may be a viable method to identify women at high-risk for cervical cancer.

""This is a demonstration that mailing self-collection kits and returning them to test for high-risk HPV infection has big potential to increase screening access among under-screened women, and to do that successfully,"" said UNC Lineberger's Jennifer S. Smith, the study's senior author, and a professor in the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health.

Although cervical cancer is preventable through early detection and treatment, the American Cancer Society estimates that more than 4,100 women will die from cervical cancer in the United States this year. Nearly 20 percent of women in the United States who are eligible for cervical cancer screening report they haven't been tested for cervical cancer within the recommended time interval, national surveys have shown.

""Women are dying unnecessarily of cervical cancer because they either haven't been vaccinated against HPV in adolescence, or they've not been getting screened according to national guidelines,"" Smith said. ""Increasing screening rates among under-screened women is of paramount importance.""

In 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration signed off on using an HPV test alone to screen for cervical cancer for women 25 years and older, in conjunction with the Pap test. Earlier this year, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force gave an ""A"" rating to HPV primary screening alone for women aged 30 to 65.

""There are a lot of different barriers that cause women to be underscreened,"" said the study's first author Andrea Des Marais, MPH, project manager with the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health. ""HPV tests are being widely used now in the United States, but only through physician collection in clinical practice, which requires that women come to a clinic. Offering HPV testing using self-collection by mail has a lot of potential to reach women who are the highest risk of being screened: those who don't access regular medical care.""

For the study, researchers mailed at-home, self-collection kits to low-income women in North Carolina who were overdue for screening by national guidelines. They included women between the ages of 30 and 64 years who had reported no history of receiving a Pap test, which checks for precancerous or cancerous cells, within the past four years.

Researchers provided study participants with self-collection brushes along with instructions for how to take a sample from inside the vagina. The brush samples were then tested in a lab for HPV and other sexually transmitted infections. Participants also self-collected samples at a clinic and handed them to a nurse, and had a pelvic exam for a clinician to collect a Pap smear sample.

The researchers compared the results from self- and clinician-samples - which were tested for high-risk HPV strains that are linked to cervical cancer - to the Pap results and the results of cervical biopsies collected during colposcopy, which is a secondary diagnostic test that confirms the presence of cervical pre-cancerous lesions among women with abnormal Pap smear results.

The home self-collection test indicated that 12.4 percent of women were infected with high-risk HPV, the self-collection tests used in the clinic found 15.5 of the women had high-risk HPV infection, and the clinician-collected test identified 11.4 percent of the women had high-risk HPV infection.

""We found comparable detection between self-collection and physician-collection,"" Des Marais said.

All women found to have high-grade cervical lesions by Pap smear or by cervical biopsy were positive for high-risk HPV on their home self-collected sample.

""We found in this sample, all of the women who had high-grade lesions had HPV-positive home self-collection results,"" Smith said. ""We didn't miss any of those high-grade cases by conducting home self-collection.""

Smith said there is more work to be done, such as identifying ways to make the self-collection process more efficient and cost-effective, and getting FDA approval for the clinical use of self-collection for cervical cancer screening.

""This is a proof-in-principle study that we used to determine whether home self-collection is highly effective for detecting high-grade disease,"" Smith said. ""We are already working on the next step, which is a clinical trial in which women who aren't up-to-date on screening get either a referral to a free clinic appointment to receive a screening, or receive a self-collection kit in the mail, followed by referral to a free clinic appointment. This will allow us to determine the effect that self-collection has on screening uptake.""

"One day, MRI brain scans may help predict whether older people will develop dementia, new research suggests.

In a small study, MRI brain scans predicted with 89 percent accuracy who would go on to develop dementia within three years, according to research at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and the University of California San Francisco.

The findings, presented Sunday, Nov. 25 at the Radiological Society of North America meeting in Chicago, suggest that doctors may one day be able to use widely available tests to tell people their risk of developing dementia before symptoms arise.

""Right now it's hard to say whether an older person with normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment is likely to develop dementia,"" said lead author Cyrus A. Raji, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of radiology at Washington University's Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology. ""We showed that a single MRI scan can predict dementia on average 2.6 years before memory loss is clinically detectable, which could help doctors advise and care for their patients.""

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, irreversible brain disorder that destroys memory and thinking skills. The disease affects 5.5 million Americans, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Neurologists can get a ballpark estimate of a patient's risk of Alzheimer's dementia using the Mini-Mental State Examination questionnaire, or by testing for the high-risk form of the gene ApoE, which increases a person's risk of Alzheimer's by up to 12-fold. Both tests were about 70 to 80 percent accurate in this study. Other assessments, such as PET scans for plaques of Alzheimer's proteins in the brain, are good at detecting early signs of Alzheimer's disease, but available to few patients. PET scans cost thousands of dollars and require radioactive materials not found in a typical hospital.

MRI brain scans are widely available and give doctors a glimpse into what's going on inside a person's brain. Raji and colleagues at the School of Medicine including Tammie Benzinger, MD, PhD, a professor of radiology, Parinaz Massoumzadeh, PhD, and Adedamola Adedokun, as well as radiologist Pratik Mukherjee, MD, PhD, of the University of California San Francisco, analyzed MRI scans for physical signs of impending cognitive decline.

They used a technique called diffusion tensor imaging to assess the health of the brain's white matter, which encompasses the cables that enable different parts of the brain to talk to one another.

""Diffusion tensor imaging is a way of measuring the movement of water molecules along white matter tracts,"" Raji said. ""If water molecules are not moving normally it suggests underlying damage to white tracts that can underlie problems with cognition.""

Using information from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative - a multisite collaboration that pools data, funding and expertise to improve clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease - Raji and colleagues identified 10 people whose cognitive skills declined over a two-year period and matched them by age and sex with 10 people whose thinking skills held steady. The average age of people in both groups was 73. Then, the researchers analyzed diffusion tensor MRI scans taken just before the two-year period for all 20 people.

The researchers found that people who went on to experience cognitive decline had significantly more signs of damage to their white matter. The researchers repeated their analysis in a separate sample of 61 people, using a more refined measure of white matter integrity. With this new analysis, they were able to predict cognitive decline with 89 percent accuracy when looking at the whole brain. When the researchers focused on specific parts of the brain most likely to show damage, the accuracy rose to 95 percent.

""We could tell that the individuals who went on to develop dementia have these differences on diffusion MRI, compared with scans of cognitively normal people whose memory and thinking skills remained intact,"" Raji said. ""What we need now, before we can bring it into the clinic, is to get more control subjects and develop computerized tools that can more reliably compare individual patients' scans to a baseline normal standard. With that, doctors might soon be able to tell people whether they are likely to have Alzheimer's develop in the next few years.""

Although there are no drugs available yet to prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease, identifying those at high risk of developing dementia within the next few years could still be beneficial, the researchers said. People could make decisions on their financial and living arrangements while they are still in full control of their faculties.

"Rockville, Md. (November 15, 2018)--Hot water treatment may help improve inflammation and blood sugar (glucose) levels in people who are unable to exercise, according to a new study. The findings are published ahead of print in the Journal of Applied Physiology.

Physical stress such as exercise can cause the short-term elevation of inflammatory markers. After exercise, the level of an inflammatory chemical (IL-6) rises. In a process called the inflammatory response, this activates the release of anti-inflammatory substances to combat unhealthily high levels of inflammation, known as chronic low-grade inflammation. Recent research has shown that raising body temperature augments the inflammatory response and provides a rationale for identifying exercise alternatives that reduce low-grade inflammation in the body. Previous studies have also found a connection between a spike in body temperature and nitric oxide production, a substance that aids blood flow and helps carry glucose throughout the body.

Researchers studied markers of inflammation and blood sugar and insulin levels in a group of sedentary, overweight men. The volunteers participated in both hot-water immersion and ambient room temperature (control) trials separated by at least three days. The researchers took blood samples before and after the participants rested in an 80-degree F room for 15 minutes. After the rest period, the participants either remained seated in the room or entered a hot-water bath for 60 minutes. In the hot water trial, the volunteers sat immersed up to their necks in 102-degree F water. The research team measured the men's heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature every 15 minutes throughout both the control and immersion conditions. Blood samples were taken again two hours after each session.

The researchers found that a single hot-water immersion session causes the elevation of Il-6 levels in the blood and increased nitric oxide production, but did not change the expression of heat shock protein 72--another protein suggested to be important for health. However, a two-week treatment period in which the men participated in daily hot-water baths showed a reduction of fasting blood sugar and insulin levels as well as improved low-grade inflammation at rest.

The men reported a level of discomfort during the hot water immersion trial, which could be due to the high temperature of the water or the length of time they were required to remain immersed. The researchers acknowledge that these conditions may make it difficult for people to commit to this type of alternative treatment. However, the positive results of decreased inflammation and improved insulin sensitivity suggest that hot-water immersion may ""improve aspects of the inflammatory profile and enhance glucose metabolism in sedentary, overweight males and might have implications for improving metabolic health in populations unable to meet the current physical activity recommendations,"" the researchers wrote.

"Research on a bacterial toxin first discovered in Adelaide has led to the development a new blood test for the early diagnosis of ovarian cancer - a disease which kills over 1000 Australian women and 150,000 globally each year.

The new blood test has the potential to dramatically improve early detection of the disease, although it will require further testing before it is available for clinicians.

A research team from the University of Adelaide and Griffith University have been studying the interactions between the toxin and an abnormal glycan (sugar) expressed on the surface of human cancer cells and released into the blood.

The team has now engineered a harmless portion of the toxin to enhance its specificity for the cancer glycan and used this to detect it in blood samples from women with ovarian cancer.

A paper published this month in Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications has shown that the new test detected significant levels of the cancer glycan in blood samples from over 90% of women with stage 1 ovarian cancer and in 100% of samples from later stages of the disease, but not in any of the samples from healthy controls.

""Ovarian cancer is notoriously difficult to detect in its early stages, when there are more options for treatment and survival rates are better. Our new test is therefore a potential game changer,"" says Professor James Paton, Director of the University of Adelaide's Research Centre for Infectious Diseases.

Professor Michael Jennings, Deputy Director of the Institute for Glycomics at Griffith University, said: ""Detection of this tumour marker may also play a role in a simple liquid biopsy to monitor disease stage and treatment.""

The team is currently seeking scientific and commercial partners to further test the technology with larger numbers of patient samples and to adapt it for mass screening.

"Before Starting A Statin, Talk It Over With Your Doctor

A study published Monday is pushing back against the notion that up to 40 percent of Americans should be taking statin drugs to reduce the risk of heart disease. The study, in the Annals of Internal Medicine, argues that current medical guidelines haven't adequately considered the risks from these widely used drugs.

""Some harms are mentioned, but it's entirely unclear how they were considered when coming up with the recommendations,"" says Milo Puhan, a physician and epidemiologist at the University of Zurich and senior author of the new study. ""In our approach we very explicitly considered the harms.""

It's important to note that statin drugs are generally safe, and harms are uncommon. On the other hand, the benefits aren't that great, either. Anywhere from 50 to 200 healthy people need to take a statin daily to prevent a single heart attack for five years, so even small harms may outweigh the potential benefits, the Swiss scientists say.

The most common side effect of these drugs is muscle pain, which usually goes away if patients stop taking the medicines. People taking statins are also at a higher risk of developing diabetes, which is harder to reverse.

Puhan also found that some statins were more effective than others, with atorvastatin (the generic name for Lipitor) being the best of the bunch. He notes that physician guidelines don't generally compare the relative value of these drugs, which are all available as inexpensive generics.

He also finds that benefits fade compared with harms as people get older. ""The elderly do not benefit as much as previous studies might have thought,"" he says.

""One size doesn't fit it all,"" he concludes. ""That's a very important message.""

Puhan says, based on his assessment, perhaps 15 to 20 percent of older adults should be taking statins – far less than the 30 or 40 percent suggested by current medical guidelines.

""I think for me, as a physician,"" says Ilana Richman, an internist at the Yale School of Medicine, ""this kind of data suggests that if we give more weight to the potential for adverse events, then maybe it's reasonable to hold off for lower-risk patients.""

She co-wrote an editorial about the paper and came away from it thinking that doctors need to spend more time talking about the plusses and minuses of statin treatment, personalizing their recommendations more than they do now. She says it's a challenge to convey these sophisticated concepts in the short amount of time doctors have to spend with their patients.

Yet that kind of dialog is increasingly the expectation. In mid-November, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology published new guidelines calling for more nuanced conversations around who would most benefit from statins.

Scott Grundy, a physician at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center who chaired the guidelines committee, says the new recommendations urge people in this gray area to get a special kind of CT scan that looks for calcium deposits in heart arteries, a signal for clogs that could cause trouble.

""If you have no coronary calcium, then your chances of having a heart attack over the next 10 years are very low,"" he says.

And it turns out that perhaps 40 percent of people who are identified as candidates based on their risk factors such as cholesterol levels and age actually have clear heart arteries, Grundy says. ""That means a lot of people are going to be treated unnecessarily if they don't have the calcium scan.""

But that test, which Grundy says is available for about $100, is controversial among some physicians. They worry that it will trigger overtreatment of conditions that the scan will pick up, but which don't require urgent attention.

And it is only useful as a screening test for people who haven't had heart disease. Statins are routinely prescribed for people who have already had a heart attack or stroke. For those patients (who weren't included in the Swiss analysis), the benefits are so clear ""it's almost mandatory to be on a statin drug,"" Grundy says.

He disagrees with a lot of the particulars in the Swiss study. So does cardiologist Roger Blumenthal, who heads the Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease at Johns Hopkins. ""The harms [analyzed in the paper] can be dealt with by a smart clinician,"" he says.

Yet both the new guidelines and the latest study agree on an important point: Doctors and patients should spend more time reviewing the benefits and risks of statins, with attention paid to each person's particular circumstances.

FRIDAY, Dec. 7, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Hot flashes, a common curse in menopause, can be especially bothersome after breast cancer. But a new study suggests an existing medication may help.

The drug is oxybutynin (Ditropan XL), long used to treat urinary incontinence.

The study found that women taking the medicine had an average of five fewer hot flashes a week, compared with three fewer among women taking a placebo.

""Oxybutynin is an option that can control these symptoms and improve quality of life,"" said lead researcher Dr. Roberto Leon-Ferre, an assistant professor of oncology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.

There are a couple of reasons for severe hot flashes after breast cancer. Chemotherapy may induce early menopause, and drugs that reduce estrogen levels may make hot flashes worse, the research team noted.

Hormone replacement therapy, which is often recommended for menopausal symptoms, is generally not advised for breast cancer survivors. That's left women who can't take hormones at a disadvantage.

Oxybutynin blocks a substance in the brain, and one of its side effects is decreased sweating, Leon-Ferre noted.

""Because of this, we can take advantage of the 'side effect' and decrease involuntary sweating associated with hot flashes, and decrease the hot flashes as well,"" he explained.

The drug could be game-changing for certain women, said Dr. Alice Police, regional director of breast surgery at Northwell Health Cancer Institute in Sleepy Hollow, N.Y.

""This is a really important advance in survivorship and compassionate cancer care,"" added Police, who wasn't involved in the study.

Because oxybutynin is already available for other conditions, Leon-Ferre said doctors could prescribe it off-label.

However, he cautioned that its long-term effects aren't known. Drugs in this class -- called anticholinergics -- have been linked with mental decline, he said.

For example, the drugs may raise the risk for problems with short-term memory, reasoning and confusion, and may also hike the risk for dementia among older patients, studies indicate.

For the new study, Leon-Ferre and his colleagues randomly assigned 150 women who experienced at least 28 hot flashes a week to oxybutynin or a placebo.

Almost two-thirds were also taking drugs to prevent a return of breast cancer, either tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor.

The women were randomly assigned to one of three groups: low-dose oxybutynin twice a day for six weeks; low-dose oxybutynin for one week followed by an increased dose; or a placebo.

Both doses appeared to reduce hot flashes better than the placebo.

And oxybutynin doesn't interfere with the metabolism of tamoxifen, Leon-Ferre said, calling that an important consideration for breast cancer survivors.

Most insurance covers oxybutynin, and a month's supply can range from $21 to $42. With insurance, copays would be less, he added.

Side effects included constipation, mild diarrhea, dry mouth, dry eyes, episodes of confusion and difficulty urinating, the researchers found.

Women taking oxybutynin also reported improvement in work, social activities, leisure activities, sleep and overall quality of life.

These are vital issues, Police said. ""I will never forget the first time a patient said, 'Thank you for curing my breast cancer, but you ruined my life,' "" she said.

The patient said endocrine therapy had caused hot flashes so severe that she could not sleep. As a result, she was having trouble at work and in all other aspects of her life, Police recalled.

""Her intimate relationship was also suffering, as nighttime had become a battleground between her and her internal temperature control,"" Police said.

The patient said she was willing to stop her hormone therapy and risk the return of breast cancer rather than live with her current symptoms, she said.

""This study makes me hopeful that these patients may have a way out of their dilemma,"" Police said. ""Instead of just telling them they should be happy to be alive, we may be able to offer a reliable treatment for some of the debilitating side effects of our treatments for breast cancer.""

The research was scheduled to be presented Friday at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in Texas. Studies presented at meetings are usually considered preliminary until peer-reviewed for publication in a medical journal.

"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson said its drug, Tremfya, was found to be more effective than a rival medicine from Novartis AG in reducing the severity and affected area in adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in a late-stage study.

After 48 weeks of therapy, 84.5 percent of the 1,048 participants treated with Tremfya showed 90 percent improvement in disease symptoms, as measured by the Psoriasis Area Severity Index, compared with 70 percent on Novartis’s Cosentyx, J&J said.

J&J is positioning Tremfya as a better alternative to Cosentyx as it seeks to take market share away from Novartis’s drug, which was launched two years ago and is among the top-selling treatments in the $11 billion global psoriasis market.

That market is expected to double to $21.11 billion by 2022, according to U.S. consultant Grand View Research.

With $2.1 billion in sales in 2017, Cosentyx has become one of the top revenue earners for Novartis and is expected to make up for falling revenue from its blood cancer treatment, Gleevec, whose patent expired two years ago.

On a media briefing following the release of J&J’s trial results, Novartis said it expected the data to have “limited clinical relevance” and no impact on plans to expand the Cosentyx label.

J&J also said Cosentyx demonstrated quicker effectiveness than Tremfya during the study.

“These results imply that Cosentyx remains a good option for moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients that want to achieve more rapid skin clearance,” brokerage Jefferies wrote in a note following the results.

“We see Cosentyx secure as a mainstay psoriasis therapy.”

Psoriasis is a chronic condition that causes an overproduction of skin cells, resulting in inflamed, red lesions or plaques, which can be itchy and painful.

About 7.5 million Americans live with plaque psoriasis, of which 20 percent have moderate-to-severe form of the disease, J&J said.

Tremfya, first approved in July 2017 as a plaque psoriasis treatment in the United States, is also being tested as a for psoriatic arthritis and Crohn’s disease.

"A Chicago couple who previously suffered two miscarriages recently welcomed a healthy baby boy thanks to a breakthrough new fertility test which helps women struggling with achieving a successful pregnancy by examining the mother's DNA.

The test is offering new hope to many family's struggling to conceive.

Carolyn Bilson and Tim O'Brien met three years ago, and say it was love at first sight.

""Literally a month later we knew, we wanted to have children,"" Bilson told ""Good Morning America.""

ABC News

But after two miscarriages, Bilson, then pushing 40, said the couple sought help from a fertility specialist in Chicago who recommended in vitro fertilization.

Their first attempt at IVF, however, failed too, according to Bilson.

""I think it was just so devastating, because we didn't anticipate that,"" she said. ""We thought the hard part would be getting pregnant, not staying pregnant.""

O'Brien added that the most ""frustrating thing"" was that ""you didn't learn anything from the previous miscarriage. So, there wasn't, 'What could we do differently?'""

The couple then learned about a new way to tailor fertility treatments specifically to the DNA of the mother, using a test that can help couples figure out the perfect time for conception, based on that DNA.

ABCNews.com

The Endometrial Receptivity Test uses a tissue sample to look at 238 genes to find out the optimum time for conception, thus increasing the couple's chance to conceive.

For Bilson, that time is two days later than the average woman.

Dr. Ilan Tur-Kaspa, an OB-GYN and the director of Chicago's Institute for Human Reproduction, described the process as ""personalized medicine.""

ABC News

""This is what we are trying to do here by personalized medicine,"" Tur-Kaspa said, adding that you can ""make sure"" that ""the uterus is ready, and optimize a time for implantation.""

The result: Their beautiful baby Westley, who is now nine months old.

""We're so lucky,"" Bilson said. ""We're so blessed.""

ABC News

OB-GYN Dr. Jessica Shepherd told ""GMA"" that this breakthrough new treatment is very exciting to the medical community because it offers another avenue for women who have recurrent miscarriages to potentially get pregnant, when it is something they never thought they could look forward to.

The new technique works by having a doctor take a sample of the women's endometrial tissue, which you can get DNA from, and from that DNA you can tell what part of the cycle is prime time to take the fertilized egg and implant it via IVF, Shepherd added.

Shepherd said that the ideal candidates are women who have had three or more miscarriages or women over 40, but emphasized that the test is not for everyone and infertility is a spectrum.

One risk of the procedure many women may not take into account is the emotional effects of it not working and you still miscarrying, Shepherd said. It is a new process and important to go over the risks of the procedure -- which can vary per person -- with your health care provider."

"Scientists have found an unexpected use for virtual reality headsets: to help pinpoint people who may later develop Alzheimer’s disease.

The devices, widely used by computer gamers, display images that can be used to test the navigational skills of people thought to be at risk of dementia. Those who do worse in the tests will be the ones most likely to succumb to Alzheimer’s later in life, scientists now believe.

By identifying potential patients far earlier than is possible at present, researchers hope it should then become easier in the long term to develop treatments aimed at halting or slowing their condition.

“It is usually thought memory is the first attribute affected in Alzheimer’s,” said project leader Dennis Chan, a neuroscientist based at Cambridge University. “But difficulty with navigation is increasingly recognised as one of the very earliest symptoms. This may predate the onset of other symptoms.

“By pinpointing those who are beginning to lose their navigational skills, we hope to show that we can target people at a much earlier stage of the condition and one day become far more effective in treating them.”

The discovery that loss of navigational skills was associated with Alzheimer’s disease was made several years ago by Chan and colleagues based at several centres in the UK. These studies used tablet computers to test navigational tasks.

But now scientists plan to take their tests to a new level with the use of the virtual reality sets in which wearers are immersed in simulated environments through which they must navigate.

Around 300 people, aged between 40 and 60, will be recruited to take part in the study. Some will have a gene that puts them at risk of the condition or will come from a family with a history of Alzheimer’s. Not all will be destined to be affected by the disease, however. Chan’s project aims to find out who will.

Wearing virtual reality headsets, participants will be asked to navigate their way towards, and then remember details of, a series of different environments.

“We will make a note of those who have particular problems and see if these are the ones who are at higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s,” explained Chan. “The aim of the study is very simple: can we detect changes in brain function before people are aware that they have them?”

Researchers recently pinpointed the significance of a tiny area of the brain known as the entorhinal cortex, which acts as a hub in a widespread brain network that controls navigation. This now appears to be the first part of the brain that succumbs to Alzheimer’s.

“The entorhinal cortex is the first brain region to show degeneration when you get Alzheimer’s, and that is where we shall be focusing our research,” said Chan, whose work is funded by the Alzheimer’s Society.

The goal of the work is to help people as they develop the disease. “To date, drug trials for Alzheimer’s have been applied when people have already got dementia, by which time considerable damage to the brain has already occurred,” Chan told the Observer.

“If we can develop drugs and administer them earlier, for instance before the disease has spread beyond the entorhinal cortex, then this would have the potential to prevent the onset of dementia.”"	Virtual reality to help detect early risk of Alzheimer’s	2018-12-16 06:00:00	https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/dec/16/alzheimers-dementia-cure-virtual-reality-navigation-skills	story_reviews_00000	fake
"(Reuters) - Evofem Biosciences Inc said on Monday its birth control gel showed effectiveness in a late-stage study, bringing the first hormone-free contraceptive close to approval and sending its shares up 27 percent before the bell.

Male condoms and oral pills dominate the $5.5 billion contraceptive market in the United States. However, oral pills cause side effects such as bleeding between periods, mood swings and nausea in women.

“These results pave the way for Amphora’s disruption of the contraception market as a novel, highly effective, non-hormonal and woman-controlled method that finally answers women’s long-awaited desire to avoid hormones,” Roth Capital Partners analyst Yasmeen Rahimi said.

The gel works by regulating vaginal pH within the normal range of 3.5 to 4.5, creating a hostile environment for sperm and certain viral and bacterial pathogens that can cause sexually transmitted diseases.

Amphora was found to have a 86 percent efficacy rate in avoiding pregnancies and no serious side-effects were observed in the study, which evaluated about 1,400 healthy women belonging to the age group 18-35 years, Evofem said.

Oppenheimer analyst Leland Gershell said he expects Amphora, the company’s lead product, to bring in peak sales of $415 million by 2032.

The company plans to resubmit the marketing application for Amphora in the second quarter next year and if approved, plans to launch the product in January 2020.

"MADISON, Wis. -- More than 700 million adults and children worldwide are obese, according to a 2017 study that called the growing number and weight-related health problems a ""rising pandemic.""

New battery-free, easily implantable weight-loss devices developed by engineers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison could offer a promising new weapon for battling the bulge.

In laboratory testing, the devices helped rats shed almost 40 percent of their body weight. Results of the study were published today (Dec. 17, 2018) in the journal Nature Communications.

Measuring less than 1 centimeter across, or about a third of the area of a U.S. penny, the tiny devices -- which are safe for use in the body and implantable via a minimally invasive procedure -- generate gentle electric pulses from the stomach's natural churning motions and deliver them to the vagus nerve, which links the brain and the stomach.

That gentle stimulation dupes the brain into thinking that the stomach is full after only a few nibbles of food.

""The pulses correlate with the stomach's motions, enhancing a natural response to help control food intake,"" says Xudong Wang, a UW-Madison professor of materials science and engineering.

Unlike gastric bypass, which permanently alters the capacity of the stomach, the effects of the new devices also are reversible. When Wang and his collaborators removed the devices after 12 weeks, the study's rats resumed their normal eating patterns and weight bounced right back on.

Wang's device has several advantages over an existing unit that stimulates the vagus nerve for weight loss. That existing unit, ""Maestro,"" approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2015, administers high-frequency zaps to the vagus nerve to shut down all communication between the brain and stomach. It requires a complicated control unit and bulky batteries which frequently must be recharged.

That ongoing maintenance can be a big barrier to use, says Luke Funk, a surgery professor in UW-Madison's Division of Minimally Invasive, Foregut and Bariatric Surgery. ""One potential advantage of the new device over existing vagus nerve stimulators is that it does not require external battery charging, which is a significant advantage when you consider the inconvenience that patients experience when having to charge a battery multiple times a week for an hour or so.""

In fact, Wang's device contains no batteries, no electronics, and no complicated wiring. It relies instead on the undulations of the stomach walls to power its internal generators.

That means the device only stimulates the vagus nerve when the stomach moves.

""It's automatically responsive to our body function, producing stimulation when needed,"" says Wang. ""Our body knows best.""

Wang is a world expert in wearable and implantable capacitive electricity-generating devices, having previously created implantable nanogenerators that harvest energy from people's beating hearts and breathing, a motion-powered bandage for wound healing, and other such devices.

He and his collaborators patented the weight-loss device through the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation and are moving forward with testing in larger animal models. If successful, they hope to move toward human trials.

""Our expectation is that the device will be more effective and convenient to use than other technologies,"" says Wang.

"About 3 million people in the US are diagnosed every year with bipolar disorder, a psychiatric condition characterized by dramatic shifts in mood from depression to mania. Currently, the standard treatment includes a combination of psychotherapy and prescription medications such as mood stabilizers and antipsychotics.

However, an emerging field of research is exploring the use of probiotics--often thought of as ""good bacteria""--as a potential new avenue for treatment of bipolar and other psychiatric mood disorders. And a new study from Baltimore's Sheppard Pratt Health System, conducted by a research team led by Faith Dickerson, finds that a probiotic supplement may reduce inflammation of the gut, which is known to exacerbate bipolar disorder. Probiotic organisms are non-pathogenic bacteria that, when present in the gut flora, are known to improve the overall health of the host.

In recent years, research has demonstrated a strong link between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. This connection, named the ""gut-brain axis"" (GBA), allows for crosstalk between the endocrine, immune, and autonomic nervous systems. The GI tract is also home to the intestinal microbiome, a complex population of roughly 100 trillion microorganisms (more than ten times the number of cells that make up the human body) that interacts with the mucosal lining of the GI tract. Studies have shown that the intimate association between the gut microbiome and GI tissue has a significant effect on the GBA.

There is also mounting evidence linking imbalances in the microbial species that make up the gut microbiome to a number of health problems including allergies, autoimmune disorders, and psychiatric mood disorders.

In the case of bipolar disorder and the GBA, previous studies have shown that inflammation, or overstimulation of the body's immune system, is a contributing factor in the disease. With this in mind, researchers developed a probiotic supplement aimed at reducing inflammation caused by microbial imbalances in the gut.

A group of patients recently hospitalized for mania participated in a 6-month study to track the effects of probiotic treatment on both their mood and the status of their immune system.

The patients were randomly selected to receive either the probiotic supplement or a placebo in addition to their usual medications. The results showed that the group receiving the probiotic supplement, on average, didn't return to the hospital as quickly and required less in-patient treatment time compared to the placebo group. The beneficial effects were most pronounced in those patients who exhibited abnormally high levels of inflammation at the beginning of the study.

Overall, these results indicate that changes in intestinal inflammation can alter the trajectory of psychiatric mood disorders and that modulating the intestinal microbiota may be a new avenue of treatment for patients suffering from these diseases.

"SAN DIEGO -- Mayo Clinic researchers have found that an oral drug, apixaban, used to treat blood clots in patients undergoing cancer therapy, is safe and effective. The drug was associated with fewer major bleeding events and fewer recurrent blood clots, compared to low-molecular- weight heparin. Their findings were presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology by Robert McBane II M.D., a Mayo Clinic cardiologist.

""Nearly 1 in 5 patients with cancer will develop a clot in the veins, referred to as either a deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism,"" says Dr. McBane. ""Clotting events can be deadly with pulmonary embolism being the second most common cause of death in cancer patients.""

While twice-daily injections of low-molecular-weight heparin has been the traditional treatment of choice for cancer patients who suffer a venous clot, Dr. McBane notes that there are numerous limitations to this therapy. ""These injections can be painful and cause considerable bruising at the injection site. Injections are expensive at nearly $100 per day. And cancer patients may experience low platelet counts and be at risk for a clotting disorder called 'heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.'"" Dr. McBane noted that cancer and cancer treatment can be associated with kidney injury, which can limit the drug's use further. Finally, Dr. McBane says there isn't is a good antidote for this medication should a bleeding problem arise.

""More recently, a number of new blood thinners called 'direct oral anticoagulants' have become available,"" says Dr. McBane. ""As a class, these drugs have a number of advantages, including oral delivery, lack of interactions with foods or other medications, and the lack of a need for monitoring drug levels."" He says these qualities make this class of drug much easier to use than the traditional blood thinners. However, it was unclear whether these drugs could be used safely in cancer patients until now.

Dr. McBane says quality of life surveys, which were taken monthly throughout the six-month trial, showed that patients markedly preferred oral apixaban over injectable dalteparin. ""We are hopeful that this medication will also improve medication compliance in cancer patients requiring blood thinner therapy.""

"Researchers at Johns Hopkins Medicine have identified in live human brains new radioactive ""tracer"" molecules that bind to and ""light up"" tau tangles, a protein associated with a number of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and other related dementias. Two studies will be published back-to-back in the December issue of Journal of Nuclear Medicine--one as featured article of the month--describing testing of three candidate molecules in patients with Alzheimer's disease, as well as the use of one molecule to measure the accumulation of tau proteins.

""One of the greatest public health challenges is Alzheimer's disease, for which there currently is no cure and no definitive diagnostic until autopsy,"" says Dean Wong, M.D., Ph.D., professor of radiology and radiological sciences, psychiatry and behavioral sciences, neurology and neuroscience, and director of the Section of High Resolution Brain PET Imaging, Division of Nuclear Medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ""We have been working hard to identify new radiopharmaceuticals that can help speed the discoveries of diagnostics and treatments for these devastating neurodegenerative disorders.""

Alzheimer's disease is characterized in the brain by the appearance of two abnormal protein structures: amyloid plaques and tangled fibers made up of a protein called tau. One of the biggest challenges in studying Alzheimer's disease thus far, according to Wong, is the inability to watch these so-called neurofibrillary tangles develop in real time.

As part of a longer term project funded by F. Hoffman-La Roche, the team previously tested a collection of approximately 550 potential tracer molecules and identified six promising tracers, eventually narrowing them down to three to be made and tested as candidate Tau PET radiopharmaceuticals. These three most promising tracers were previously tested in nonhuman primates, and the results looked promising enough to test in people.

The researchers recruited a total of 12 patients with Alzheimer's disease, seven younger healthy controls (ages 25-38 years old) and five older healthy controls (age 50 or older) for brain-only PET scans. An additional six older healthy controls were recruited for full-body scanning. The study was divided into three parts. In the first part, each person was injected with two of the three randomly designated tracers (on separate visits) prior to receiving a brain PET scan with subsequent evaluation to determine which molecule performed best. In the second part of the study, researchers tested the optimal tracer, called F-18 RO948, with additional brain imaging in five patients with Alzheimer's and five older controls, with follow-up of previously seen patients to evaluate the potential progression of tau protein tangling after an average span of approximately 16 months.

The third part of the study examined six older controls undergoing whole-body scanning. In total, the researchers looked at 80 different regions in the brain to evaluate how well the tracers were taken up by the brain, how well they penetrated through the tissue and how specifically they bound to the tau protein rather than just sticking indiscriminately to anything. Regions of the brain that typically contain accumulated tau protein include the temporal lobe, parietal lobe and occipital lobe, among others; grey matter in the cerebellum is thought to contain low or no tau in patients with Alzheimer's. They found that healthy brains retained little to no tracer, whereas the brains of those with Alzheimer's showed tau to be in regions of the brain consistent with previously reported postmortem data on filamentous tangles.

In the second paper, the team examined the detailed quantification of tau binding via F-18 RO948 in 11 patients with Alzheimer's disease, five young cognitively normal controls and five older cognitively normal controls. They verified that detailed quantification of the tested and retested tracer in those five patients with Alzheimer's and five older controls generated good and reproducible results. According to Wong, this body of work reveals that, as compared with the currently used Tau tracer, F-18 AV1451, the new tracer, F-18 RO948, does not bind randomly to other tissue, offering greater clarity into quantification of potential tau burden within the human brain.

""It really takes a village to make progress in biomedical research, and this project was no exception, with the involvement of the PET team at Hopkins, a CRO who helped recruit healthy subjects, colleagues in psychiatry and behavioral sciences, colleagues at the National Institute of Aging and neuroscience imaging experts at Roche,"" says Wong. ""This is a true example of cross-disciplinary collaboration, and I'm honored to have such great collaborators.""

"Wilmington, DE, December 17, 2018 - The CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system may be able to restore the effectiveness of first-line chemotherapies used to treat lung cancer by deleting or ""knocking out"" a gene in cancer tumors that helps the tumors develop resistance to the drugs. That was the conclusion of a new study published today in the journal Molecular Therapy Oncolytics by scientists from The Gene Editing Institute of the Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute at Christiana Care Health System.

The study reports that in both tissue culture and in a mouse, tumor growth stopped and there was a dramatic decrease in the volume of existing tumors when chemotherapy was combined with CRIPSP-Cas9, which was used to disable a tumor gene known as NRF2. Previous studies have shown that the NRF2 gene controls cell functions in lung cancer tumors that helps them thwart the effect of chemotherapies that might otherwise reduce or eliminate them entirely.

""Our goal is to see if CRISPR can be used with chemotherapy to provide a safe, affordable way to give patients who are not responding to treatment at least a fighting chance against this very challenging cancer,"" said Eric Kmiec, Ph.D., the principal author of the study and the director of the Gene Editing Institute. ""We believe that finding ways to use CRISPR to improve existing treatments will lead to some of the first benefits for patients while we tackle the vital ethical issues around the use of CRISPR for edits that can be passed on through DNA. This is an exciting step in the journey of exploring the health benefits of gene editing.""

The study was led by Pawel Bialk, research scientist at the Gene Editing Institute, the nation's only CRISPR-focused research initiative situated in a community health care system.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Dr. Kmiec said there are chemotherapies that have helped patients achieve remission or at least live longer and enjoy a better quality of life by significantly slowing the progress of the disease. But he said some patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, the most common form of lung cancer, are resistant to chemotherapy agents used to treat the disease or develop resistance after being exposed to the drugs.

Developing CRISPR in a Community Health Center: A Patient-Focused Approach

Dr. Kmiec said the lung cancer work reflects an approach adopted by the Gene Editing Institute to move cautiously in developing medical applications of gene editing. Based inside the Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute at Christiana Care, his research team gains unique insight into the lives and needs of cancer patients and the health care professionals who care for them, which helps them to maintain a strong focus on doing what's right for patients.

Dr. Kmiec noted that while his team is working to move into human trials, the CRISPR application being developed for lung cancer does not involve directly editing a patient's genome --only the genes in the tumor.

CRISPR stands for ""clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats."" It was originally a defense mechanism found in bacteria that allows the bacteria to recognize and slice up the DNA of invading viruses. Scientists have learned how to manipulate this mechanism so that it essentially can be programmed to find and remove a specific sequence of DNA code--which acts like software for controlling biological activity in a cell. Cas9 is a reference to an enzyme, sometimes described as a form of ""molecular scissors,"" that is used by CRISPR to cut out a section of DNA code.

Research Aimed at Real-World, Affordable Solutions

Dr. Kmiec said there are many efforts under way to modify CRISPR so that it can be used to not only remove or ""knock out"" a section DNA, but also to replace or ""knock in"" a new strand of code. But he said there continues to be significant safety concerns around this type of CRISPR application. He said for now, his team is focused on ""using CRISPR in its native form, which is to just cut out a section of DNA,"" and to start with applications that do not directly impact the patient's DNA. He said using CRISPR to do things like improving drug response represents the ""low-hanging fruit"" of CRISPR patient applications.

""We think it's best to start with CRISPR therapies that involve relatively conservative uses of this powerful tool,"" Dr. Kmiec said. ""This approach can also hopefully help contain costs and provide a level of safety and reliability that is reassuring for patients and increases the chance that insurance companies will provide coverage.""

Dr. Kmiec said that as a CRISPR research program that treats patients from across the economic spectrum, his scientists are keenly aware of the challenges of making cutting edge medical treatments accessible and beneficial for all patients.

""This work is another significant step on the pathway to FDA approval,"" said Nicholas J. Petrelli, M.D., FACS, Bank of America endowed medical director of the Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute. ""The Gene Editing Institute is taking a careful and methodical approach to developing innovative therapies. Dr. Kmiec and his team interact with our oncologists who deal with lung cancer every day on how gene editing could have a realistic impact and improve treatment. This multidisciplinary clinical/scientific team has been working together to develop a compassionate bench-to-bedside approach. Their laboratory benches are literally down the hall from our patients and the oncologist's offices.""

"For Immediate Release: April 29, 2016

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Nuplazid (pimavanserin) tablets, the first drug approved to treat hallucinations and delusions associated with psychosis experienced by some people with Parkinson’s disease.

Hallucinations or delusions can occur in as many as 50 percent of patients with Parkinson’s disease at some time during the course of their illness. People who experience them see or hear things that are not there (hallucinations) and/or have false beliefs (delusions). The hallucinations and delusions experienced with Parkinson’s disease are serious symptoms, and can lead to thinking and emotions that are so impaired that the people experiencing them may not relate to loved ones well or take appropriate care of themselves.

“Hallucinations and delusions can be profoundly disturbing and disabling,” said Mitchell Mathis, M.D., director of the Division of Psychiatry Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Nuplazid represents an important treatment for people with Parkinson’s disease who experience these symptoms.”

An estimated 50,000 Americans are diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease each year, according to the National Institutes of Health, and about one million Americans have the condition. The neurological disorder typically occurs in people over age 60, when cells in the brain that produce a chemical called dopamine become impaired or die. Dopamine helps transmit signals between the areas of the brain that produce smooth, purposeful movement -- like eating, writing and shaving. Early symptoms of the disease are subtle and occur gradually. In some people Parkinson’s disease progresses more quickly than in others. As the disease progresses, the shaking, or tremor, which affects the majority of people with Parkinson’s disease, may begin to interfere with daily activities. Other symptoms may include depression and other emotional changes; hallucinations and delusions; difficulty in swallowing, chewing, and speaking; urinary problems or constipation; skin problems; and sleep disruptions.

The effectiveness of Nuplazid was shown in a six-week clinical trial of 199 participants. Nuplazid was shown to be superior to placebo in decreasing the frequency and/or severity of hallucinations and delusions without worsening the primary motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.

As with other atypical antipsychotic drugs, Nuplazid has a Boxed Warning alerting health care professionals about an increased risk of death associated with the use of these drugs to treat older people with dementia-related psychosis. No drug in this class is approved to treat patients with dementia-related psychosis.

In clinical trials, the most common side effects reported by participants taking Nuplazid were: swelling, usually of the ankles, legs, and feet due to the accumulation of excessive fluid in the tissue (peripheral edema); nausea; and abnormal state of mind (confused state).

Nuplazid was granted breakthrough therapy designation for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson’s disease. Breakthrough therapy designation is a program designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint. The drug was also granted a priority review. The FDA’s priority review program provides for an expedited review of drugs that offer a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness for the treatment, prevention, or diagnosis of a serious condition.

Nuplazid is marketed by Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. of San Diego, California.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Epclusa to treat adult patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) both with and without cirrhosis (advanced liver disease). For patients with moderate to severe cirrhosis (decompensated cirrhosis), Epclusa is approved for use in combination with the drug ribavirin. Epclusa is a fixed-dose combination tablet containing sofosbuvir, a drug approved in 2013, and velpatasvir, a new drug, and is the first to treat all six major forms of HCV.

“This approval offers a management and treatment option for a wider scope of patients with chronic hepatitis C,” said Edward Cox, M.D., director of the Office of Antimicrobial Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.

Hepatitis C is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the liver that can lead to diminished liver function or liver failure. There are at least six distinct HCV genotypes, or strains, which are genetically distinct groups of the virus. Knowing the genotype helps inform treatment recommendations and the duration of treatment. Approximately 75 percent of Americans with HCV have genotype 1; 20-25 percent have genotypes 2 or 3; and a small numbers of patients are infected with genotypes 4, 5 or 6. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, HCV infection becomes chronic in approximately 75 to 85 percent of cases. Patients who suffer from chronic HCV infection over many years may have complications, such as bleeding, jaundice (yellowish eyes or skin), fluid accumulation in the abdomen, infections, liver cancer and death.

The safety and efficacy of Epclusa for 12 weeks was evaluated in three Phase III clinical trials of 1,558 subjects without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis (mild cirrhosis). Results demonstrated that 95–99 percent of patients who received Epclusa had no virus detected in the blood 12 weeks after finishing treatment, suggesting the patients’ infections had been cured. The safety and efficacy of Epclusa was also evaluated in a clinical trial of 267 subjects with decompensated cirrhosis (moderate to severe cirrhosis), of whom 87 subjects received Epclusa in combination with ribavirin for 12 weeks, and 94 percent of these patients had no virus detected in the blood 12 weeks after finishing treatment.

The most common side effects of Epclusa include headache and fatigue. Epclusa and ribavirin combination regimens are contraindicated for patients for whom ribavirin is contraindicated.

Epclusa carries a warning for patients and health care providers that serious slowing of the heart rate (symptomatic bradycardia) and cases requiring pacemaker intervention have been reported when amiodarone is used with sofosbuvir in combination with another HCV direct-acting antiviral. Co-administration of amiodarone with Epclusa is not recommended. Epclusa also carries a warning not to use with certain drugs that may reduce the amount of Epclusa in the blood which could lead to reduced efficacy of Epclusa.

Epclusa was reviewed under the FDA’s priority review program, which provides for an expedited review of drugs that treat serious conditions and, if approved, would provide significant improvement in safety or effectiveness.

Epclusa is manufactured and marketed by Gilead Sciences, Inc., of Foster City, California.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved three new indications for Ilaris (canakinumab). The new indications are for rare and serious auto-inflammatory diseases in adult and pediatric patients:

Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS);

Hyperimmunoglobulin D Syndrome (HIDS)/Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency (MKD); and

Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF).

All three syndromes are hereditary diseases that are characterized by periodic attacks of fever and inflammation, as well as severe muscle pain. There are no previously approved therapies for TRAPS or HIDS/MKD.

“For the first time, patients with TRAPS and HIDS/MKD, two painful and life altering diseases, have access to a treatment that may help improve their quality of life,” said Badrul Chowdhury, M.D., Ph.D, director of the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Rheumatology Products in FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.

Ilaris was previously approved for another periodic fever syndrome called Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS) and for active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Health care professionals should review the prescribing information in the labeling for detailed information about the approved uses.

Approvals for the new indications were based on clinical studies, including safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic data. The most common adverse reactions for these indications are injection site reactions and being more susceptible to catching colds.

Ilaris can cause serious side effects, including increased risk of serious infections. Ilaris can lower the immune system’s ability to fight infections. Other serious side effects include decreased ability to fight infections (immunosuppression) and allergic reactions. Patients experiencing any symptoms of an allergic reaction should call their healthcare provider, including: rash, itching and hives, difficulty breathing or swallowing, and dizziness or feeling faint. Patients should not get live vaccines if receiving Ilaris. Patients should not receive Ilaris if they are allergic to canakinumab or any of the ingredients in Ilaris.

Ilaris is manufactured and distributed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, of East Hanover, New Jersey.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Intrarosa (prasterone) to treat women experiencing moderate to severe pain during sexual intercourse (dyspareunia), a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA), due to menopause. Intrarosa is the first FDA approved product containing the active ingredient prasterone, which is also known as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA).

During menopause, levels of estrogen decline in vaginal tissues, which may cause a condition known as VVA, leading to symptoms such as pain during sexual intercourse.

""Pain during sexual intercourse is one of the most frequent symptoms of VVA reported by postmenopausal women,"" said Audrey Gassman, M.D., deputy director of the Division of Bone, Reproductive, and Urologic Products (DBRUP) in the Office of Drug Evaluation III in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). ""Intrarosa provides an additional treatment option for women seeking relief of dyspareunia caused by VVA.""

Efficacy of Intrarosa, a once-daily vaginal insert, was established in two 12-week placebo-controlled clinical trials of 406 healthy postmenopausal women, 40 to 80 years of age, who identified moderate to severe pain during sexual intercourse as their most bothersome symptom of VVA. Women were randomly assigned to receive Intrarosa or a placebo vaginal insert. Intrarosa, when compared to placebo, was shown to reduce the severity of pain experienced during sexual intercourse.

The safety of Intrarosa was established in four 12-week placebo-controlled trials and one 52-week open-label trial. The most common adverse reactions were vaginal discharge and abnormal Pap smear.

Although DHEA is included in some dietary supplements, the efficacy and safety of those products have not been established for diagnosing, curing, mitigating, treating or preventing any disease.

Intrarosa is marketed by Quebec-based Endoceutics Inc.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Trulance (plecanatide) for the treatment of Chronic Idiopathic Constipation (CIC) in adult patients.

“No one medication works for all patients suffering from chronic gastrointestinal disorders,” said Julie Beitz, M.D., director of the Office of Drug Evaluation III in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “With the availability of new therapies, patients and their doctors can select the most appropriate treatment for their condition.”

According to the National Institutes of Health, an estimated 42 million people are affected by constipation. Chronic idiopathic constipation is a diagnosis given to those who experience persistent constipation and for whom there is no structural or biochemical explanation.

Trulance, taken orally once daily, works locally in the upper GI tract to stimulate secretion of intestinal fluid and support regular bowel function.

The safety and efficacy of Trulance were established in two 12-week, placebo-controlled trials including 1,775 adult participants. Participants were randomly assigned to receive a placebo or Trulance, once daily. Participants in the trials were required to have been diagnosed with constipation at least six months prior to the study onset and to have less than three defecations per week in the previous three months, as well as other symptoms associated with constipation. Participants receiving Trulance were more likely to experience improvement in the frequency of complete spontaneous bowel movements than those receiving placebo, and also had improvements in stool frequency and consistency and straining.

Trulance should not be used in children less than six years of age due to the risk of serious dehydration. Trulance should be avoided in patients six years of age to 18 years of age. The safety and effectiveness of Trulance have not been established in patients less than 18 years of age. Trulance should not be used in patients with known or suspected mechanical gastrointestinal obstruction.

The most common and serious side effects of Trulance was diarrhea. Patients may experience severe diarrhea. If severe diarrhea occurs, patients should stop taking Trulance and contact their health care provider.

Trulance is manufactured by New York, New York-based Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Siliq (brodalumab) to treat adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Siliq is administered as an injection.

Siliq is intended for patients who are candidates for systemic therapy (treatment using substances that travel through the bloodstream, after being taken by mouth or injected) or phototherapy (ultraviolet light treatment) and have failed to respond, or have stopped responding to other systemic therapies.

""Moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis can cause significant skin irritation and discomfort for patients, and today’s approval provides patients with another treatment option for their psoriasis,"" said Julie Beitz, M.D., director of the Office of Drug Evaluation III in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. ""Patients and their health care providers should discuss the benefits and risks of Siliq before considering treatment.""

Psoriasis is a skin condition that causes patches of skin redness and flaking. Psoriasis is an autoimmune disorder that occurs more commonly in patients with a family history of the disease, and most often begins in people between the ages of 15 and 35. The most common form of psoriasis is plaque psoriasis, in which patients develop thick, red skin with flaky, silver-white scales.

Siliq’s active ingredient (brodalumab) binds to a protein that causes inflammation, inhibiting the inflammatory response that plays a role in the development of plaque psoriasis.

Siliq’s safety and efficacy were established in three randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials with a total of 4,373 adult participants with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who were candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. More patients treated with Siliq compared to placebo had skin that was clear or almost clear, as assessed by scoring of the extent, nature and severity of psoriatic changes of the skin.

Suicidal ideation and behavior, including completed suicides, have occurred in patients treated with Siliq during clinical trials. Siliq users with a history of suicidality or depression had an increased incidence of suicidal ideation and behavior compared to users without this history. A causal association between treatment with Siliq and increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior has not been established.

Because of the observed risk of suicidal ideation and behavior, the labeling for Siliq includes a Boxed Warning and the drug is only available through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Siliq REMS Program. Notable requirements of the Siliq REMS Program include the following:

Prescribers must be certified with the program and counsel patients about this risk. Patients with new or worsening symptoms of depression or suicidality should be referred to a mental health professional, as appropriate.

Patients must sign a Patient-Prescriber Agreement Form and be made aware of the need to seek medical attention should they experience new or worsening suicidal thoughts or behavior, feelings of depression, anxiety or other mood changes.

Pharmacies must be certified with the program and must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive Siliq.

Siliq is also approved with a Medication Guide to inform patients of the risk of suicidal ideation and behavior, and that because Siliq is a medication that affects the immune system, patients may have a greater risk of getting an infection, or an allergic or autoimmune condition. Patients with Crohn’s disease should not use Siliq. Health care providers should also evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with Siliq. Health care providers should not administer Siliq to patients with active TB infection, and should avoid immunizations with live vaccines in patients being treated with Siliq.

The most common adverse reactions reported with the use of Siliq include joint pain (arthralgia), headache, fatigue, diarrhea, throat pain (oropharyngeal pain), nausea, muscle pain (myalgia), injection site reactions, influenza, low white blood cell count (neutropenia) and fungal (tinea) infections.

Siliq is marketed by Bridgewater, New Jersey-based Valeant Pharmaceuticals.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Dupixent (dupilumab) injection to treat adults with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis). Dupixent is intended for patients whose eczema is not controlled adequately by topical therapies, or those for whom topical therapies are not advisable. Dupixent can be used with or without topical corticosteroids.

“FDA’s approval of Dupixent demonstrates our commitment to approving new and innovative therapies for patients with skin disease,” said Julie Beitz, M.D., director of the Office of Drug Evaluation III in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Eczema can cause significant skin irritation and discomfort for patients, so it is important to have a variety of treatment options available to patients, including those patients whose disease is not controlled by topical therapies.”

Atopic dermatitis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease, is often referred to as “eczema,” which is a general term for several types of inflammation of the skin. Atopic dermatitis is the most common of the many types of eczema; onset typically begins in childhood and can last through adulthood. The cause of atopic dermatitis is a combination of genetic, immune and environmental factors. In atopic dermatitis, the skin develops red, scaly and crusted bumps, which are extremely itchy. Scratching leads to swelling, cracking, “weeping” clear fluid, and finally, coarsening and thickening of the skin.

Dupixent is administered as an injection under the skin. Dupixent’s active ingredient is an antibody (dupilumab) that binds to a protein [interleukin-4 (IL-4) receptor alpha subunit (IL-4R a )], that causes inflammation. By binding to this protein, Dupixent is able to inhibit the inflammatory response that plays a role in the development of atopic dermatitis.

The safety and efficacy of Dupixent were established in three placebo-controlled clinical trials with a total of 2,119 adult participants with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis not adequately controlled by topical medication(s). Overall, participants who received Dupixent achieved greater response, defined as clear or almost clear skin, and experienced a reduction in itch after 16 weeks of treatment.

Dupixent can cause side effects such as serious allergic reactions and eye problems, such as pink eye (conjunctivitis) and inflammation of the cornea (keratitis). If patients experience new or worsening eye symptoms such as redness, itching, pain or visual changes, they should consult a health care provider. The most common side effects include injection site reactions; cold sores in the mouth or on the lips; and eye and eyelid inflammation, including redness, swelling and itching.

The safety and efficacy of Dupixent have not been established in the treatment of asthma. Patients who also have asthma should not adjust or stop their asthma treatment without talking to their physicians.

The FDA granted the application for Dupixent Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy designation.

The FDA granted the approval of Dupixent to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Noctiva (desmopressin acetate) nasal spray for adults who awaken at least two times per night to urinate due to a condition known as nocturnal polyuria (overproduction of urine during the night). Noctiva is the first FDA-approved treatment for this condition.

“Today’s approval provides adults who overproduce urine at night with the first FDA-approved therapeutic option to help reduce the number of times a night they wake up to urinate,” said Hylton V. Joffe, M.D., M.M.Sc., director of the Division of Bone, Reproductive, and Urologic Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “It is important to know that Noctiva is not approved for all causes of night-time urination, so patients should discuss their symptoms with their health care provider who can determine the underlying cause of the night-time urination and whether Noctiva is right for them.”

Nocturia (wakening at night to urinate) is a symptom that can be caused by a wide variety of conditions, such as congestive heart failure, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, medications, or diseases of the bladder or prostate. Before considering Noctiva, health care providers should evaluate each patient for possible causes for the nocturia, and optimize the treatment of underlying conditions that may be contributing to the night-time urination. Because Noctiva is approved only for adults with nocturia caused by nocturnal polyuria, health care providers should confirm overproduction of urine at night with a 24-hour urine collection, if one has not been obtained previously. Health care providers should also be mindful of underlying conditions that can cause nocturia, but that make treatment with Noctiva unsafe, such as excessive drinking of fluids or symptomatic congestive heart failure.

Noctiva is taken daily, approximately 30 minutes before going to bed. It works by increasing the absorption of water through the kidneys, which leads to less urine production.

Noctiva’s efficacy was established in two 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in 1,045 patients 50 years of age and older with nocturia due to nocturnal polyuria. Although these trials showed a small reduction in the average number of night-time urinations with Noctiva compared to placebo, more patients treated with Noctiva were able to at least halve their number of night-time urinations, and patients treated with Noctiva had more nights with one or fewer night-time urinations.

Noctiva is being approved with a boxed warning and a Medication Guide because it can cause low sodium levels in the blood (hyponatremia). Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening if it is not promptly diagnosed and treated, leading to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest or death. Health care providers should make sure the patient’s sodium level is normal before starting Noctiva, and should check sodium levels within one week and approximately one month after starting treatment and periodically thereafter. The lower Noctiva dose is recommended as the starting dose for those who may be at risk for hyponatremia, such as the elderly. Noctiva should not be used in patients at increased risk of severe hyponatremia, such as those with excessive fluid intake, those who have illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances, certain patients with kidney damage, and in those using certain medicines, known as loop diuretics or glucocorticoids.

Noctiva should also not be used in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension because fluid retention can worsen these underlying conditions. Use of Noctiva should be discontinued temporarily in patients with certain nasal conditions such as colds or allergies until those conditions have resolved.

Noctiva is also not recommended for the treatment of nocturia in pregnant women. Nocturia is usually related to normal changes in pregnancy that do not require treatment with Noctiva. Noctiva should not be used in children.

The most common side effects of Noctiva in clinical trials included nasal discomfort, cold symptoms (nasopharyngitis), nasal congestion, sneezing, high or increased blood pressure, back pain, nose bleeds, bronchitis and dizziness.

Although there are other FDA-approved medications that also contain desmopressin, none of those medications are approved to treat nocturia.

Noctiva is manufactured by Renaissance Lakewood, LLC for Milford, Pennsylvania-based Serenity Pharmaceuticals, LLC.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Rydapt (midostaurin) for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who have a specific genetic mutation called FLT3, in combination with chemotherapy. The drug is approved for use with a companion diagnostic, the LeukoStrat CDx FLT3 Mutation Assay, which is used to detect the FLT3 mutation in patients with AML.



AML is a rapidly progressing cancer that forms in the bone marrow and results in an increased number of white blood cells in the bloodstream. The National Cancer Institute estimated that approximately 19,930 people would be diagnosed with AML in 2016 and 10,430 were projected to die of the disease.

“Rydapt is the first targeted therapy to treat patients with AML, in combination with chemotherapy,” said Richard Pazdur, M.D., acting director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and director of the FDA’s Oncology Center of Excellence. “The ability to detect the gene mutation with a diagnostic test means doctors can identify specific patients who may benefit from this treatment.”

Rydapt is a kinase inhibitor that works by blocking several enzymes that promote cell growth. If the FLT3 mutation is detected in blood or bone marrow samples using the LeukoStrat CDx FLT3 Mutation Assay, the patient may be eligible for treatment with Rydapt in combination with chemotherapy.

The safety and efficacy of Rydapt for patients with AML were studied in a randomized trial of 717 patients who had not been treated previously for AML. In the trial, patients who received Rydapt in combination with chemotherapy lived longer than patients who received chemotherapy alone, although a specific median survival rate could not be reliably estimated. In addition, patients who received Rydapt in combination with chemotherapy in the trial went longer (median 8.2 months) without certain complications (failure to achieve complete remission within 60 days of starting treatment, progression of leukemia or death) than patients who received chemotherapy alone (median three months).

Common side effects of Rydapt in patients with AML include low levels of white blood cells with fever (febrile neutropenia), nausea, inflammation of the mucous membranes (mucositis), vomiting, headache, spots on the skin due to bleeding (petechiae), musculoskeletal pain, nosebleeds (epistaxis), device-related infection, high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) and upper respiratory tract infection. Rydapt should not be used in patients with hypersensitivity to midostaurin or other ingredients in Rydapt. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not take Rydapt because it may cause harm to a developing fetus or a newborn baby. Patients who experience signs or symptoms of lung damage (pulmonary toxicity) should stop using Rydapt.

Rydapt was also approved today for adults with certain types of rare blood disorders (aggressive systemic mastocytosis, systemic mastocytosis with associated hematological neoplasm or mast cell leukemia). Common side effects of Rydapt in these patients include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, swelling (edema), musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, fatigue, upper respiratory tract infection, constipation, fever, headache and shortness of breath.

The FDA granted this application Priority Review, Fast Track (for the mastocytosis indication) and Breakthrough Therapy (for the AML indication) designations.

The FDA granted the approval of Rydapt to Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation. The FDA granted the approval of the LeukoStrat CDx FLT3 Mutation Assay to Invivoscribe Technologies Inc.

"For Immediate Release: February 13, 2018

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today permitted marketing of the first blood test to evaluate mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), commonly referred to as concussion, in adults. The FDA reviewed and authorized for marketing the Banyan Brain Trauma Indicator in fewer than 6 months as part of its Breakthrough Devices Program.

Most patients with a suspected head injury are examined using a neurological scale, called the 15-point Glasgow Coma Scale, followed by a computed tomography or CT scan of the head to detect brain tissue damage, or intracranial lesions, that may require treatment; however, a majority of patients evaluated for mTBI/concussion do not have detectable intracranial lesions after having a CT scan. Availability of a blood test for concussion will help health care professionals determine the need for a CT scan in patients suspected of having mTBI and help prevent unnecessary neuroimaging and associated radiation exposure to patients.

“Helping to deliver innovative testing technologies that minimize health impacts to patients while still providing accurate and reliable results to inform appropriate evaluation and treatment is an FDA priority. Today’s action supports the FDA’s Initiative to Reduce Unnecessary Radiation Exposure from Medical Imaging—an effort to ensure that each patient is getting the right imaging exam, at the right time, with the right radiation dose,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “A blood-testing option for the evaluation of mTBI/concussion not only provides health care professionals with a new tool, but also sets the stage for a more modernized standard of care for testing of suspected cases. In addition, availability of a blood test for mTBI/concussion will likely reduce the CT scans performed on patients with concussion each year, potentially saving our health care system the cost of often unnecessary neuroimaging tests.”

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2013 there were approximately 2.8 million TBI-related emergency department visits, hospitalizations and deaths in the U.S. Of these cases, TBI contributed to the deaths of nearly 50,000 people. TBI is caused by a bump, blow or jolt to the head or a penetrating head injury that disrupts the brain’s normal functioning. Its severity may range from mild to severe, with 75 percent of TBIs that occur each year being assessed as mTBIs or concussions. A majority of patients with concussion symptoms have a negative CT scan. Potential effects of TBI can include impaired thinking or memory, movement, sensation or emotional functioning.

“A blood test to aid in concussion evaluation is an important tool for the American public and for our Service Members abroad who need access to quick and accurate tests,” said Jeffrey Shuren, M.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “The FDA’s review team worked closely with the test developer and the U.S. Department of Defense to expedite a blood test for the evaluation of mTBI that can be used both in the continental U.S. as well as foreign U.S. laboratories that service the American military.”

The Brain Trauma Indicator works by measuring levels of proteins, known as UCH-L1 and GFAP, that are released from the brain into blood and measured within 12 hours of head injury. Levels of these blood proteins after mTBI/concussion can help predict which patients may have intracranial lesions visible by CT scan and which won’t. Being able to predict if patients have a low probability of intracranial lesions can help health care professionals in their management of patients and the decision to perform a CT scan. Test results can be available within 3 to 4 hours.

The FDA evaluated data from a multi-center, prospective clinical study of 1,947 individual blood samples from adults with suspected mTBI/concussion and reviewed the product’s performance by comparing mTBI/concussion blood tests results with CT scan results. The Brain Trauma Indicator was able to predict the presence of intracranial lesions on a CT scan 97.5 percent of the time and those who did not have intracranial lesions on a CT scan 99.6 percent of the time. These findings indicate that the test can reliably predict the absence of intracranial lesions and that health care professionals can incorporate this tool into the standard of care for patients to rule out the need for a CT scan in at least one-third of patients who are suspected of having mTBI.

The Brain Trauma Indicator was reviewed under the FDA’s De Novo premarket review pathway, a regulatory pathway for some low- to moderate-risk devices that are novel and for which there is no prior legally marketed device.

The FDA is permitting marketing of the Brain Trauma Indicator to Banyan Biomarkers, Inc.

"MONDAY, Jan. 11 (HealthDay News) -- Stroke victims brought to a hospital on a weekend are more likely to receive the powerful clot-dissolving drug tPA than those who arrive on a weekday, a study finds.

It's an unexpected finding, since the study was triggered by a previous report showing that aggressive treatment for heart attacks was more likely to be given during the week rather than the weekend, noted study lead author Abby S. Kazley, assistant professor of health administration and policy at the Medical University of South Carolina.

The heart attack study sent Kazley and her colleagues searching through the records of almost 79,000 people admitted to Virginia hospitals between 1998 and 2006 with ischemic strokes, in which a clot blocks a brain blood vessel.

The research team found that relatively few patients received tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), which works quickly to break up clots. In fact, only 543 of the 58,378 people admitted on weekdays got the drug, compared to 229 of the 20,279 admitted on weekends. The numbers show that the weekend stroke victims were 20 percent more likely to be given tPA than weekday arrivals.

""That seemed counterintuitive, but the more we considered it the more likely it appeared to be the case,"" Kazley said. Her team published the findings in the January issue of the Archives of Neurology.

During the week, neurologists are more likely to be involved with routine procedures, she noted. ""Because there are fewer such elective procedures on weekends, patients have better access to expertise and better access to diagnostic technology such as CT [computed tomography] scanners,"" Kazley reasoned. ""They are also more likely to present at an earlier time, since they are less likely to have to battle traffic to get to the hospital.""

And hospitals that meet the standards for certification as stroke treatment centers are required to maintain the same level of treatment on weekends as on weekdays, she pointed out.

The general rule is that tPA therapy is effective when given in the first three hours after an ischemic stroke occurs. The low rate of tPA therapy seen in the study ""is similar to the national levels seen in other studies,"" Kazley said.

Despite the higher level of tPA treatment on weekends, no statistical significance in the death rates of the two groups was seen in the study. ""You're looking at the 1 percent of patients who got the treatment, and [at those low numbers] it is very difficult to find a significant difference,"" Kazley said.

The study results surprised Dr. Jin-Moo Lee, an associate professor of neurology at Washington University in St Louis.

""It's missing a lot of important information,"" according to Lee. ""Two important factors are not considered. One is the severity of the strokes. A second is the time of presentation. Still, it's kind of a surprising finding that warrants further investigation.""

According to Kazley, the clinical lesson of the study for physicians and hospitals is that ""providers have to be prepared to provide this type of care all around the clock and need to be ready to do it quickly because of the three-hour window.""

The lesson for the general public is the need for alertness in detecting the symptoms of a stroke and getting treatment quickly, she said. According to the American Heart Association, stroke symptoms can include a sudden weakness of the face, arm or leg, especially on one side of the body, difficulty speaking, vision trouble, dizziness and headache.

HealthDay Reporter

MONDAY, Jan. 21 (HealthDay News) -- A skin patch for the treatment of migraines, and the intense waves of nausea that often accompany these debilitating headaches, has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Called Zecuity, the patch contains sumatriptan, one of the most widely prescribed medications for migraines.

According to Dr. Fawad Khan, a neurologist with Ochsner Neuroscience Institute in New Orleans, few drugs are approved for the treatment of acute, symptomatic migraine. To complicate matters, many migraine sufferers can also experience severe bouts of nausea and vomiting.

Another expert described the problem this way.

""I've had some patients where the nausea and vomiting was so bad they couldn't even swallow a pill,"" said Nancy Waltman, a nurse practitioner with the University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Nursing, Lincoln Division.

A nasal spray is available, as is an injection, but many patients aren't comfortable with these options, Khan and Waltman noted.

Khan said the Zecuity patch is ""simple, efficient and can deliver the exact amount of dosage with minimal variability.""

The patch is attached to the upper arm or thigh, and when the patient pushes a button the drug is delivered through the skin. Zecuity, which is battery-operated, delivers 6.5 milligrams of sumatriptan over the course of about five hours and can relieve nausea, as well as reduce sensitivity to light and sound.

NuPathe Inc., which makes Zecuity, hopes to have the patch on the market later this year.

Research involving 800 patients ultimately led to the approval of Zecuity. One study found that 18 percent of patients using the patch were headache-free after two hours, compared with 9 percent of those using an inactive placebo. About half achieved a reduction in their headache after two hours, compared with 29 percent of those using the placebo.

And 84 percent of patients using the patch were relieved of their nausea, compared with 63 percent of those in the placebo group, according to a company news release.

The most frequent side effects were pain at the site of application along with tingling, itching, warmth and discomfort.

Patients with heart disease or who are using antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors should also be careful when taking sumatriptans, said Waltman, who added that she thought the patches ""are wonderful.""

One concern, though, is cost, Waltman cautioned.

It's not clear how much the patches will cost, but the class of medications known as triptans can be expensive, as much as $300 a month (although sumatriptan now has a generic version), Waltman said.

In general, though, ""the more options that are available to migraine headache patients, the better,"" Waltman said. ""Migraine patients tend to be underdiagnosed and undertreated and inappropriately treated.""

NuPathe CEO Armando Anido told Bloomberg News, ""We anticipate the product will be available for sale in the fourth quarter of this year.""

"Newswise — CHAPEL HILL, NC – UNC researchers say the results from the multi-site phase 2 and 3 trials of brexanolone injection are not only promising, but could change the way postpartum depression (PPD) is treated.

Brexanolone injection works differently than existing anti-depressant medications, and if approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) later this year, will be the first new class of anti-depressants in decades, and the first drug specifically indicated for PPD.

“With current anti-depressant SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) it could take four to six weeks to get a treatment response. In the brexanolone trials, we saw patients starting to feel better within days,” said the trial’s academic principal investigator, Samantha Meltzer-Brody, MD, MPH, director of Perinatal Psychiatry Program at the UNC School of Medicine.

David Rubinow, MD, chair of the Department of Psychiatry at the UNC School of Medicine and a coauthor of the paper, says time is especially crucial for new mothers experiencing postpartum depression because the weeks and months following birth are a critical period for mother-infant bonding. Common symptoms of PPD – a mood disorder in women that can be triggered by fluctuations in reproductive hormones – include low mood, feeling overwhelmed, anxious and ruminating thoughts, potential withdrawal from the baby and her family, and suicidal thoughts in the most severe cases. PPD is one of the most common complications of pregnancy, with between 10 and 20 percent of mothers worldwide experiencing it.

“Having a drug developed specifically for postpartum depression is a game-changer for women’s health,” said Meltzer-Brody. “With our latest results, we believe that brexanolone, if approved, could provide relief for women with a range of postpartum severity.”

The paper, published in The Lancet, includes a new integrated analysis of results from three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that took place at 30 sites in the U.S., including UNC’s Perinatal Psychiatry Unit. Eligible women were aged 18-45 years old and were six months postpartum or less at screening. They also had to be experiencing moderate to severe postpartum depression, which was assessed by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D).

The integrated analysis looked at results of the trials which randomized 209 women to receive a double-blinded 60-hour infusion of either brexanolone injection 90 µg/kg/hr or placebo. A unique dose group of brexanolone 60 µg/kg/hr in one of the studies was not included in the integrated efficacy analysis, but was included in integrated analyses of safety. Brexanolone injection 90 µg/kg/hr was administered to 102 women with moderate or severe PPD who also were evaluated throughout the infusion, after the infusion stopped and then periodically for up to 30 days. Another 107 women were administered a placebo and evaluated during the same timeframe. The first statistically significant reduction in depression severity with brexanolone injection relative to placebo was observed as early as 24 hours after dosing. At the end of the 60-hour infusion, the average reduction in patients’ Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D or depression severity score) was 17.0 points for women in the brexanolone injection 90 µg/kg/hr group, versus 12.8 in the placebo group (p<0.0001). The reduction of symptoms in the patients receiving brexanolone injection was maintained throughout the last study visit at Day 30. The most common (≥10% of subjects) adverse events following during brexanolone injection administration were headache, dizziness and somnolence.

“This is a very different model for how we treat depression. Having a drug approved to treat PPD that works quickly and effectively, yet is also durable, would be a huge step forward for psychiatry in general,” Meltzer-Brody said.

Brexanolone injection is an allosteric modulator of both synaptic and extra-synaptic GABAᴀ receptors. In postpartum depression, the GABA pathway may play a key role in regulating hormones that researchers believe can lead to PPD.

Sage Therapeutics is the developer of brexanolone injection and sponsor of the trials. A New Drug Application is currently under review by the FDA and brexanolone injection has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation. The FDA has assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act target date of December 19, 2018."

"Newswise — Toronto, ON (February 5, 2018) -- A deceased donor kidney has been preserved and kept healthy outside the body in a device that mimics the body’s physiological functions and successfully transplanted into a human, for the first time in North America.

The technique, unique solution, and device are part of a Phase I clinical trial at Toronto General Hospital (TG), University Health Network (UHN), assessing the safety of the device, with subsequent phases examining its efficacy.

Kidneys are the most frequently transplanted solid organ, but a continuing shortage of donor kidneys impacts wait times and quality of life of those waiting for a transplant.

One way to address this gap by the transplant community worldwide has been to extend the criteria of those donor kidneys used for transplantation. But these “extended criteria” organs – those from older donors or from donors who have two or more risk factors - do not tolerate current “cold storage” methods for organ preservation well.

This can result in greater injury to the kidney, or in a “sleepy kidney” which functions poorly at the beginning, requiring dialysis until it recovers days or weeks later. This early delayed function also impacts its longer-term survival.

In Ontario, about 20 per cent of all transplanted kidneys are expanded criteria donor kidneys. This means donors are on average older than 60 years, or younger than 60 years and likely have hypertension, higher BMI (body mass index), diabetes, or died due to stroke.

Ex vivo organ perfusion is an innovative organ preservation technique that seeks to overcome the limitations of current “cold storage” method of preservation.

Developed in the laboratory of UHN transplant surgeon Dr. Markus Selzner, with the help of UHN transplant surgeons Drs. David Grant and Anand Ghanekar, as well as Drs. Lisa Robinson and Darius Bagli from The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids), it took four years to perfect the solution for the donor kidney and to modify the heart-lung machine for use in the warm perfusion technique.

This technology has advantages over the usual cold storage method in which a deceased donor kidney is cooled on ice to about four degrees Celsius, with no oxygen, slowing down its metabolism, and inhibiting the repair process.

The kidney cannot survive longer than 30 hours in cold preservation. The new warm preservation technique avoids the damage of cold storage and instead allows the donor organ to improve and repair itself, potentially leading to better outcomes for patients.

Using a heart-lung bypass machine, with customized tubing adapted to the kidney’s smaller blood vessels - and a specially blended preservation solution of blood, nutrients, minerals, amino acids, oxygen, glucose, antibiotics and drugs – surgeons, nurses and perfusionists at TG prepared a deceased donor kidney in a transplant operating room to be placed in a warm preservation solution before transplantation into a patient in late November, 2017.

The aim was to enhance kidney function, minimize injury and avoid a “sleepy kidney” from an extended criteria kidney. About 30-40 per cent of deceased donor kidneys do not work immediately, requiring longer hospitals stays for the patients and dialysis.

Zhao Xiao, 53, received the deceased donor kidney, which was placed on the device for 3.5 hours at body temperature.

“I feel great,” says Xiao, through an interpreter. He was able to get up and walk two day after his transplant. Xiao says he was happy to volunteer to become the first patient to receive a kidney that was improved by the new technology.

“This can make a difference to other patients, so I am glad to be the first one helping them with my experience.”

As soon as the donor kidney was reattached to the patient, it turned ruby-red and started to pour out urine, indicating that it was functioning well.

“It is a champion!” says an elated Dr. Selzner, who has done about 500 kidney transplants in the past 14 years. “It behaved like a normal kidney, despite it being an extended criteria donor kidney.”

He points out blood tests within 48 hours showed that the kidney was removing wastes and excess fluid from the blood normally. Since the kidney did not “struggle” after transplant, there is a greater likelihood that its long-term outcome will be better, he adds.

“This technique will change the landscape of organ donation by improving organ preservation, allowing us to better assess and regenerate the donor organ on the device before we transplant it into a patient. We will know how healthy that organ is before the transplant operation,” says Dr. Markus Selzner, co-investigator of the clinical trial.

Dr. Selzner, a clinician-scientist at the Toronto General Hospital Research Institute and Associate Professor of Surgery at the University of Toronto, previously modified the preservation solution and supervised the research on a successful warm perfusion technique for the deceased donor liver organ.

“Working on this project has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my professional career,” says Dr. Lisa Robinson, Division Head of Nephrology at SickKids. “It is exciting to see this work be transformed from an idea to experimental research, and now to directly impacting patients.”

“Even with the shortage of donor organs, we have to decline some of our donor organs because of the damage they sustain in the retrieval process,” says Dr. David Grant, Surgical Director of the Multi-Organ Transplant Program, UHN. He is also co-investigator of the clinical trial and transplanted the donor kidney, which was on the modified heart-lung bypass machine, into the recipient.

“This new technology can help us answer the critical question, ‘What’s the best way to improve function and recover and repair the kidney before transplantation to get the best results for our patients?’”

Dr. Grant, who is also Professor of Surgery at the University of Toronto, emphasized that high-impact research projects such as this require strong collaborative teams – including researchers, surgical residents, nurses, Canadian Blood Services, perfusionists, colleagues at SickKids - working together on experimental and clinical trials.

“UHN is one of the few places in the world where you can have a good idea and then find the right people to make something like this happen.”

Other collaborators on the research and clinical trial at UHN include: Drs. Joseph Kim and Anand Ghanekar, co-leads of the kidney transplant program at UHN and transplant nephrologist Dr. Istvan Mucsi.

Dr. Grant also praised the strong support and efforts of Trillium Gift of Life, which co-ordinates organ and tissue donation across Ontario, in helping to ensure that the transplant team could begin their clinical trials with this new technique.

The technique of warm organ perfusion outside the body was pioneered by the Toronto Lung Transplant Program at TG in 2008 by Drs. Shaf Keshavjee and Marcelo Cypel to better treat, repair and assess high-risk donor lungs outside the body. The lungs are placed in a protective dome in which a system continuously pumps a bloodless solution of oxygen, proteins and nutrients into the injured donor lungs, mimicking normal physiological conditions.

This makes it possible for the injured cells to begin repairing themselves, and sets the stage for more sophisticated repair techniques to be applied to donor lungs. Since 2012, there has been an unprecedented 63 per cent increase in lung transplants at TG as a result of this system.

At any point in time, there are about 1,500 patients waiting for a transplant in Ontario. About 1,000 people wait for a kidney transplant across the province, usually about four years. About five per cent of people on kidney waiting lists die every year.

Research for the ex vivo kidney perfusion project was supported by the Canadian National Transplant Research Program (CNTRP), a national research network designed to increase organ and tissue donation in Canada and enhance the survival and quality of life of Canadians who receive transplants.

Generous philanthropic support, made through Toronto General & Western Hospital Foundation, has played and continues to play an integral role in the development of ex vivo technology and its impact on patients’ lives.

"Newswise — BOSTON – (February 19, 2015) – In the first clinical trial directly comparing three drugs most commonly used to treat diabetic macular edema, researchers found all were effective in improving vision and preventing vision loss. However, one drug, aflibercept, provided greater improvement for people with more severe vision loss when treatment was initiated. The trial was conducted by the National Eye Institute Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCR.net) including researchers from Joslin Diabetes Center. The results appeared in the February online edition of the New England Journal of Medicine.

Diabetes is a significant risk factor for developing eye diseases. The most common diabetic eye disease and a leading cause of blindness is diabetic retinopathy, which is caused by elevated blood sugar levels damaging the blood vessels of the retina and affects approximately 7.7 million Americans. About 750,000 Americans with diabetic retinopathy have diabetic macular edema (DME) in which fluid leaks into the macula, the area of the retina used when looking straight ahead. The fluid causes the macula to swell, blurring vision. “DME is the leading cause of moderate vision loss in working-age adults with diabetes. With the rate of diabetes increasing dramatically worldwide, many individuals will be at risk for vision loss from diabetic eye complications and DME is a major global health concern,” says Jennifer K. Sun, M.D., M.P.H., a member of the study research team and writing committee, and an Investigator in the Section on Vascular Biology, an ophthalmologist in Beetham Eye Institute at Joslin and an Assistant Professor at Harvard Medical School.

In an earlier study, Joslin researchers reported that VEGF, a major growth factor for blood vessels, is elevated in the eye fluids of patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy and DME, causing leakage and the growth of abnormal blood vessels. Over the past few years, drugs that target VEGF have become a standard treatment for DME, providing a preferred alternative or adjunct to laser treatment. The standard Medicare per-injection costs of the three anti-VEGF drugs evaluated in the study are about $1960 for aflibercept (Eylea), $1200 for ranibizumab (Lucentis) and $70 for bevacizumab (Avastin).

At the start of the trial, 660 adults with DME were enrolled: their average age was 61 years and 90 percent had type 2 diabetes. About half of the participants had 20/32 or 20/40 vision and the other half had vision of 20/50 or worse. They were randomized into three treatment groups and received the assigned study drug by injection into the eye until the DME resolved or stabilized. Participants on bevacizumab and ranibizumab received, on average, 10 injections, versus nine for those on aflibercept.

One year after starting treatment, all participants had improved vision. Those with mild vision loss (20/32 to 20/40) at baseline in all three treatment groups gained on average almost two lines on an eye chart. For participants with more severe vision loss (20/50 or worse), aflibercept improved vision on average nearly four lines, bevacizumab about 2.5 lines, and ranibizumab almost three lines.

“The results clearly remove any doubts about anti-VEGF drugs’ efficacy in treating DME. All three drugs improved vision substantially, with aflibercept showing more visual gains in patients with worse vision at the start of the trial. Physicians now have robust data to help them counsel patients and make informed decisions regarding treatment options,” says study co-author Lloyd P. Aiello, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School, Director of Joslin’s Beetham Eye Institute, co-head of Joslin's Section of Vascular Cell Biology, and founding chair of the DRCR Network.

In light of these positive results, “it is more important than ever for patients with diabetes to be evaluated on a regular basis for eye disease and receive treatment promptly once indicated as we now have excellent success in treating patients with DME,” says Dr. Aiello.

The trial was supported through a cooperative agreement from the National Eye Institute and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Regeneron Pharmaceutical provided the aflibercept and Genentech provided the ranibizumab for the study. The DRCR.net had complete control over the design of the study, data ownership and content of presentations and publications related to this study.

"Newswise — Bethesda, Md. (March 23, 2017)—Statin drugs are widely used to manage high cholesterol and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. But in a new review of more than 50 studies, researchers cite reductions in liver inflammation and improvements in other related factors as reasons why statins make good candidates for treating chronic liver disease. The article is published ahead of print in the American Journal of Physiology—Gastrointestinal and Liver Physiology.

Reducing cholesterol can have a positive effect on many chronic liver disorders, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, as well as in biliary disorders. In some studies, the research team found that statins reduced inflammatory molecules that are typically elevated with liver disease and improved inflammation in the endothelium (cells that line the blood vessels). Statin use may also lead to:• Decreased fibrosis (hardening or scarring of tissue),• Less development of fatty liver,• Slowed or halted spread of hepatitis C virus,• Improvement of portal hypertension (high blood pressure in the liver’s blood vessels), • Destruction of existing liver tumor cells, and • Reduced risk of developing liver cancer.

The researchers acknowledge that statin drugs can contribute to liver damage in some people, but for people with advanced liver disease, “[s]tatins are cost-effective, generally well-tolerated by patients and the benefits of statin treatment in most patients outweigh their potential hepatotoxic risk.”

"Newswise — SEATTLE (March 24, 2017) – The U.S. Food and Drug Administration yesterday granted accelerated approval to the checkpoint inhibitor Bavencio (avelumab) for the treatment of patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), including those who have not received prior chemotherapy. Avelumab is the first FDA-approved treatment for metastatic MCC and the first disease that the drug has ever been approved to treat.

A rare and aggressive form of skin cancer, MCC, is 35 times less common than melanoma, but on average, it is about three times more likely to be deadly. Until now, there were no systemic therapies approved by the Food and Drug Administration for this cancer, and no approved therapies once the cancer had spread.

Tom Judd, who lives near Portland, Oregon, knows what it is like to be diagnosed with a deadly cancer for which there is no approved drug. After being diagnosed with MCC in 2013, his cancer jumped from a small pimple on his nose throughout his body, growing until it interfered dangerously with organ function.

By early 2015, the disease had nearly killed him, despite surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Then he enrolled in a clinical trial and received his first of many infusions of the new immunotherapy drug – avelumab. Within six weeks of that first infusion, more than one-third of the cancer throughout his body was gone, and today, more than 90 percent of his tumor mass has disappeared.

Because of the data from this clinical trial, avelumab (brand name Bavencio) has become the first systemic therapy approved by the FDA for MCC, and the first treatment of any kind approved for metastatic MCC.

Dr. Paul Nghiem, affiliate investigator of the Clinical Research Division at Fred Hutch, and the George F. Odland Endowed Chair in Dermatology at the University of Washington School of Medicine, is a senior investigator on the clinical trial that led to the FDA approval and the senior author on the Lancet Oncology article that preceded the approval. He is a leading expert on MCC and a pioneer of immunotherapy for the disease.

The approval as a first- and second-line therapy “is a really big deal,” said Nghiem. His team foundational work on the role of immune cells in MCC paved the way for immunotherapy trials in the disease, including one he leads of another immunotherapy drug with a similar mechanism of action (Merck’s Keytruda), whose results were published last year and changed the field overnight.

A practicing physician, he treats patients with MCC and other skin cancers at Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Fred Hutch’s clinical care partner. He is a consultant for EMD Serono Inc. and receives funding from Bristol-Myers Squibb to perform biomarker studies in MCC clinical trials.

"Newswise — LOS ANGELES (EMBARGOED UNTIL 7 A.M. EDT on APRIL 14, 2015) – An injection of stem cells into the eye may soon slow or reverse the effects of early-stage age-related macular degeneration, according to new research from scientists at Cedars-Sinai. Currently, there is no treatment that slows the progression of the disease, which is the leading cause of vision loss in people over 65.

“This is the first study to show preservation of vision after a single injection of adult-derived human cells into a rat model with age-related macular degeneration,” said Shaomei Wang, MD, PhD, lead author of the study published in the journal STEM CELLS and a research scientist in the Eye Program at the Cedars-Sinai Board of Governors Regenerative Medicine Institute.

The stem cell injection resulted in 130 days of preserved vision in laboratory rats, which roughly equates to 16 years in humans. Age-related macular degeneration affects upward of 15 million Americans. It occurs when the small central portion of the retina, known as the macula, deteriorates. The retina is the light-sensing nerve tissue at the back of the eye. Macular degeneration may also be caused by environmental factors, aging and a genetic predisposition.

When animal models with macular degeneration were injected with induced neural progenitor stem cells, which derive from the more commonly known induced pluripotent stem cells, healthy cells began to migrate around the retina and formed a protective layer. This protective layer prevented ongoing degeneration of the vital retinal cells responsible for vision.

Cedars-Sinai researchers in the Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC) Core, directed by Dhruv Sareen, PhD, with support from the David and Janet Polak Foundation Stem Cell Core Laboratory, first converted adult human skin cells into powerful induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), which can be expanded indefinitely and then made into any cell of the human body. In this study, these induced pluripotent stem cells were then directed toward a neural progenitor cell fate, known as induced neural progenitor stem cells, or iNPCs.

“These induced neural progenitor stem cells are a novel source of adult-derived cells which should have powerful effects on slowing down vision loss associated with macular degeneration,” said Clive Svendsen, PhD, director of the Board of Governors Regenerative Medicine Institute and contributing author to the study. “Though additional pre-clinical data is needed, our institute is close to a time when we can offer adult stem cells as a promising source for personalized therapies for this and other human diseases.”

Next steps include testing the efficacy and safety of the stem cell injection in preclinical animal studies to provide information for applying for an investigational new drug. From there, clinical trials will be designed to test potential benefit in patients with later-stage age-related macular degeneration.

Additional Cedars-Sinai authors include Dhruv Sareen, PhD; Yuchun Tsai, PhD; Bin Lu, MD, PhD; Benjamin Bakondi, PhD; Sergey Girman, PhD; and Anais Sahabian, PhD.

"Newswise — Omega-3 fatty acids may lower the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal obese women, according to researchers.

The protection likely comes from the fatty acids' anti-inflammatory effects, said Dr. Andrea Manni, professor and division chief of endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism, Penn State College of Medicine.

Obesity is a major breast cancer risk factor in postmenopausal women, and scientists believe increased inflammation is an important underlying cause in this population.

""Omega-3 fatty acids have an anti-inflammatory effect, so that's one of the reasons why we suspected it may be particularly effective in obese women,"" Manni said.

Some epidemiological data supports the idea that omega-3s protect against breast cancer, but the findings have been inconsistent. Manni suspected that data from normal-weight women obscured the results.

Normal-weight women have less inflammation than heavier women, and are therefore less likely to benefit from anti-inflammatory omega-3s, he said.

To tease apart the effects, Manni's team, working alongside researchers from Emory University and Colorado State University, looked at the influence of prescription omega-3 supplementation on breast density in different weight women. Breast density is a well-established biomarker for breast cancer risk, and may be an independent risk factor, as well.

""The higher the breast density, the more likely the woman will develop breast cancer,"" Manni said.

The study included 266 healthy postmenopausal women with high breast density detected by routine mammograms. The women either received no treatment, the antiestrogen drug Raloxifene, the prescription omega-3 drug Lovaza or a combination of the two drugs.

At the conclusion of the two-year study, the researchers found that increasing levels of omega-3 in the blood were associated with reduced breast density—but only in women with a body mass index above 29, bordering on obesity.

Although Lovaza contains both of the fatty acids DHA -- 375 milligrams -- and EPA -- 465 milligrams, only DHA blood levels were associated with breast density reduction. The researchers plan to test the effect of DHA alone in obese subjects, potentially in combination with weight loss, in a future trial.

""The finding supports the idea that omega-3s, and specifically DHA, are preferentially protective in obese postmenopausal women,"" Manni said. ""This represents an example of a personalized approach to breast cancer prevention.""

These findings may help to support future research looking at the direct effect of omega-3 supplementation on breast cancer incidence in obese women.

Manni added that, with obesity-related cancers on the rise, the findings could have implications beyond breast cancer.

The researchers also made a secondary discovery. Lovaza is an omega-3 drug FDA-approved for the treatment of severe high triglycerides at the dose of 4 milligrams daily. In the current study, the combination of Lovaza and a half recommended dose of Raloxifene at 30 milligrams, was superior to the individual treatments in reducing triglycerides and LDL -- “bad” -- cholesterol and increasing HDL -- “good” -- cholesterol.

"Epilepsy patients who have not responded to standard drug treatments may benefit from a new therapy that delivers high frequency bursts of electrical stimulation, called microbursts, to the brain. Rush University Medical Center in Chicago is the first health care provider in the world to provide this treatment, known as microburst vagus nerve stimulation.

The treatment is akin to a heart pacemaker. A surgeon places an electronic pulse generator under the skin in the chest and attaches it to the left vagus nerve, which runs down the side of the body from the stem of the brain through the neck and chest to the abdomen.

The device sends regular electrical pulses through the vagus nerve to the brain to prevent epileptic seizures from occurring. The stimulator’s settings can be changed according to each patient’s needs using a special programming wand, with no additional surgery needed.

Dr. Rebecca O’Dwyer, assistant professor of neurology at Rush, is participating in a nationwide clinical study of the initial safety and effectiveness of microburst vagus nerve stimulation in patients who have drug-resistant epilepsy. She enrolled the first patient in the entire study on February 28.

“At the Rush Epilepsy Center, we regularly collaborate with members of the neurosurgery and neuroradiology department in our research endeavors. We look forward to the results of this study and hope we can bring relief to more people with epilepsy,” O’Dwyer said.

Rush was the first hospital in Chicago to offer epilepsy patients the original vagal nerve stimulator, which uses mild pulses of electricity, after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved it in 1997 as an adjunctive treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy. “We are now exploring how higher frequency bursts delivered to the vagus nerve will affect epilepsy that does not respond to traditional therapies,” said O’Dwyer.

The study consists of two groups of patients with epilepsy, enrolling up to 40 patients in total at approximately 15 sites in the United States. The first group will include 20 patients with primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The second group will consist of 20 patients with partial onset seizures, including complex partial seizures with or without secondary generalization.

Each patient will participate in the study for a minimum of 15 months. The study will measure the percent change in seizure frequency and occurrence of stimulation-related adverse events in comparison to a patient’s baseline. Activation of various areas of the brain in response to stimulation will be assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging or fMRI. Patients also will be evaluated to assess changes from baseline in seizure severity, quality of life, antiepileptic drug use, suicidality and adverse events.

To be considered for enrollment in the study or for information, contact The Rush Epilepsy Center at 312-942 5939."

"PHILADELPHIA – Patients with aggressive subtypes of locally-advanced breast cancer may have new treatment options on the horizon, according to two reports published in July in the New England Journal of Medicine. Results of two different investigational arms of a multi-drug phase II trial conducted in part by researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and the Abramson Cancer Center, show that use of new targeted therapies neratinib or a combination of veliparib and carboplatin improves outcomes, when used in addition to standard chemotherapy before surgery for patients with HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancer, respectively. The results are part of the multi-institutional I-SPY 2 study.

“Compared to standard therapies alone, the drugs tested in the trial substantially reduced the presence of residual disease in the breast tissue and lymph nodes (known as achieving pathological complete response, or “pCR”) when administered before surgery,” said Angela DeMichele, MD, MSCE, a professor of Hematology-Oncology and Epidemiology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, a co-investigator and Chair of Trial Operations for the study, known as I-SPY 2. “pCR strongly predicts prevention of later recurrence of incurable metastatic disease. These results suggest that neratinib and veliparib-carboplatin are very promising treatment options for patients with HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancer, respectively. In addition, the platform used for the I-SPY 2 trial allows the research team to test these and other new therapies simultaneously, targeting tumor subtypes that would be most likely to benefit from the therapies, minimizing the exposure of patients to treatments that are not likely to work for their disease subtype and accelerating drug development”

The data presented in the two NEJM articles shows that when added to standard, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the combination of the molecularly targeted experimental drug veliparib plus carboplatin showed sufficient improvement to meet the pre-specified threshold for “graduation” from the trial, signifying a high likelihood for success in a modest, confirmatory phase 3 neoadjuvant trial in the triple negative subset. Likewise, the experimental drug neratinib was found to have sufficient improvement in the pCR rate for patients in the HER2-positive/HR-negative subset, that it too was “graduated” from the I-SPY 2 trial.

“Because there are so many subtypes of breast cancer, and because we always test drugs in the metastatic and then adjuvant setting, finding effective therapies is a very difficult and long process. The I-SPY 2 platform allows therapies to be tested and evaluated in more expeditious, cost-effective ways,” said Laura J. Esserman, MD, MBA, a professor of Surgery and Radiology and director of the Carol Franc Buck Breast Care Center at UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center in San Francisco, Principal Investigator on the I-SPY 2 trial and a senior author on the reports. “These results provide valuable information on which drugs should proceed to confirmatory trials to improve outcomes for patients with extremely aggressive cancers that put women at risk for early recurrence and death. For these patients, time is of the essence. In particular, finding drug combinations that are effective and less toxic is extremely important. The new studies show that by using the I-SPY 2 model to match therapies with biomarker subsets, we can create trials that are more focused, smaller, and faster, thereby exposing more patients to effective treatments.”

A major achievement in the progression of I-SPY 2 has been significantly reducing the time it takes to move forward from initiation of discussions with drug companies to enrollment of the first patients. I-SPY 2 has compressed this timeline from an average timeframe of 18 - 36 months to five months. The I-SPY 2 study start-up period takes approximately 45-60 days, with more than 50 percent of the sites opening and enrolling patients, as opposed to the traditional study start-up timing of 10 to 13 months, with less than 25 percent of the sites opening and enrolling.

More than 45 investigators, from the nation’s most prestigious and innovative cancer research centers, co-authored the two NEJM articles, with hundreds of staff and investigators involved in I-SPY 2 overall. In addition to Dr. Esserman, the Principal Investigators for I-SPY 2 is Donald A. Berry, PhD, a professor in the department of Biostatistics at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, and founder of Berry Consultants. A complete list of the participating centers and investigators is provided in a Supplementary Appendix available at NEJM.org.

The I-SPY 2 Trial is sponsored by QuantumLeap Healthcare Collaborative, a non-profit foundation that was established in 2005 as a collaboration between medical researchers at University of California at San Francisco, and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. QuantumLeap’s mission is to accelerate transfer of high-impact research in clinical processes and systems technology into widespread adoption so that patients and physicians can benefit from the research as soon as practicable. QuantumLeap provides operational, financial and regulatory oversight to I-SPY 2 and is also the sponsor of the I-SPY Phase 1 program and I-SPY 3, a companion phase 3 confirmatory trial that is in development."

"A new study suggests that continuous movement while sitting may increase metabolic rate more than standing at a desk.

Craig Horswill, clinical associate professor of kinesiology and nutrition at the University of Illinois at Chicago, says the study adds to the growing body of evidence that suggests strategies for increasing non-exercise active thermogenesis — defined as spontaneous activity unrelated to a fitness routine — are needed to help overcome the detrimental effects of prolonged sitting.

Sitting has been identified as a risk factor for early mortality, independent of the presence of a disease, such as cancer or diabetes. Up to 7 percent of deaths have been attributed to sitting alone.

“Sitting is bad for our health, but it is a big part of daily life for many people,” said Horswill, an expert in exercise and metabolism in UIC’s College of Applied Health Sciences. “Exercise is a good way to counteract the negative effects of sitting, but just incorporating physical activity into one part of our day may not be enough to overcome the damage caused by prolonged sitting and an otherwise sedentary lifestyle.”

Because the workday is a major contributor to sedentary behavior, with more than 20 percent of workers in the U.S. reporting more than 8 hours each day, tactics that promote workstation activity have emerged in recent years, including standing desks, as well as dynamic pedal and treadmill workstations.

Horswill and his colleagues compared the metabolic rate produced by three workstations: seated at a desk, seated at a desk equipped with a device that stimulates leg movement and standing at a desk. The device, which is commercially available, was a movable footrest, suspended from the underside of the desk, which enabled the feet to swing, twist or teeter.

Participants in the study familiarized themselves with the workstations during one visit. On a second visit, researchers collected metabolic rate and heart rate data during three progressive stages: seated, seated with the device and standing. Each stage was 15 minutes.

The researchers found that modest movement while seated elevated the metabolic rate more than sitting and more than standing, by 17 and 7 percent respectively, and had no detrimental effect on cognitive function. The findings are published in WORK, a journal affiliated with the Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists and endorsed by the International Ergonomics Association.

“These results suggest that non-exercise active thermogenesis, which we call NEAT, can increase movement and calorie burning, and may have the potential to impact health,” said Horswill, the senior author on the study. “We expected to see the metabolic rate increase with each progressive stage, but instead found that metabolic rates from movement while seated were either equal to or higher than rates while standing.”

Horswill says the study needs to be further validated, but that the findings should be especially applicable to individuals poised to benefit from NEAT but unable to access popular standing desks because of injury, disability or discomfort.

“This is more evidence that NEAT, something everyone can do throughout the day, may be an important strategy for improving health, and even reducing early death,” said Horswill.

"Newswise — CHICAGO – Epidural anesthesia may do more than relieve pain during labor; in some women it may decrease the likelihood of postpartum depression, suggests a preliminary study presented at the ANESTHESIOLOGY® 2016 annual meeting.

“Labor pain matters more than just for the birth experience. It may be psychologically harmful for some women and play a significant role in the development of postpartum depression,” said Grace Lim, M.D., director of obstetric anesthesiology at Magee Women’s Hospital of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and lead investigator on the study. “We found that certain women who experience good pain relief from epidural analgesia are less likely to exhibit depressive symptoms in the postpartum period.”

The researchers controlled for factors already known to increase the risk for postpartum depression, including pre-existing depression and anxiety, as well as post-delivery pain caused by tissue trauma during childbirth. After accounting for these factors, the study found that in some women, labor pain was still a significant risk factor for postpartum depression symptoms. And, therefore, alleviating this pain might help reduce the risk for postpartum depression. In the study, researchers reviewed the medical records of 201 women who used epidural analgesia and had their pain assessed using a 0-10 scale during labor. They calculated the percent improvement in pain (PIP) throughout labor after the implementation of epidural analgesia. Depression risk was assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) six weeks after childbirth. Researchers found the higher the PIP scores, the lower the EPDS scores.

“Although we found an association between women who experience less pain during labor and lower risk for postpartum depression, we do not know if effective pain control with epidural analgesia will assure avoidance of the condition,” said Dr. Lim. “Postpartum depression can develop from a number of things including hormonal changes, psychological adjustment to motherhood, social support, and a history of psychiatric disorders.”

Labor pain may be more problematic for some women than others, the authors note. Additional research is needed to identify which women are more likely to experience severe labor pain and who would benefit the most from effective labor pain-control strategies to help reduce the risk and affect of pain on postpartum recovery.

"Newswise — Chicago – Chronic back and leg pain sufferers in search of better pain relief options may have a new choice. According to a study published in the Online First edition of Anesthesiology, the official medical journal of the American Society of Anesthesiologists® (ASA®), patients who received a novel high frequency form of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) therapy experienced significantly greater, long-term relief for both chronic back and leg pain, when compared to a traditional low frequency form of SCS therapy.“This is the first long-term study to compare the safety and effectiveness of high frequency and traditional SCS therapy for back and leg pain,” said Leonardo Kapural, M.D., lead study author and professor of anesthesiology at Wake Forest University School of Medicine and clinical director at Carolinas Pain Institute at Brookstown in Winston-Salem, N.C. “Chronic back and leg pain have long been considered difficult to treat and current pain relief options such as opioids have limited effectiveness and commonly known side effects. Given the prevalence of chronic pain, high frequency SCS is an exciting advance for our patients.”



SCS is an increasingly common therapy that delivers electric pulses to the spinal cord, through a small device implanted under the skin, for difficult to treat chronic pain in the trunk and limbs. SCS is reversible and is an important option for chronic pain sufferers who otherwise would rely on opioids or back surgery for relief. The new treatment, called HF10™ therapy, uses proprietary high frequency pulses of 10,000 Hz, compared to traditional SCS which uses frequencies of 40 to 60 Hz. HF10 therapy also provides pain relief without paresthesia – a stimulation-induced sensation commonly perceived as tingling or buzzing, which masks a patient’s perception of pain – typical of traditional SCS. These sensations are often distracting or uncomfortable to patients and limit the utility and acceptance of traditional devices. Identifying a new intervention that does not rely on paresthesia to mask pain is novel to SCS and has the potential to improve pain relief and quality of life for these complex patients. In the study, researchers examined 171 patients with chronic back or leg pain who were implanted at 10 comprehensive pain treatment centers. Of these, 90 patients received HF10 therapy, while 81 patients had traditional SCS.



At three months, 85 percent of back pain and 83 percent of leg pain patients in the HF10 therapy group experienced a 50 percent reduction in pain or greater. Conversely, only 44 percent of back pain and 56 percent of leg pain patients in the traditional SCS group experienced a 50 percent reduction in pain. None of the patients in the HF10 therapy group experienced paresthesia. HF10 therapy remained more effective than traditional SCS over the 12 month study period. More patients in the HF10 therapy group reported being “very satisfied” with their pain relief (55 percent versus 32 percent). More than 1.5 billion people worldwide suffer from chronic pain, with lower back pain being the most frequent condition affecting 23 to 26 percent of the population.

"Multivitamins in pregnancy may be linked to lower autism risk in children

Evidence not yet sufficient to change practice but findings warrant further investigation, say researchers

Taking multivitamins during early pregnancy may be associated with a reduced risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children compared with mothers who do not take multivitamins, finds a study published in The BMJ today.

The researchers stress that their findings cannot establish cause and effect, but say they raise questions about a possible association that warrant further investigation.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) includes a range of conditions, including Asperger syndrome, that affect a person’s social interaction, communication, interests and behaviour. It’s estimated that about 1 in every 100 people in the UK has ASD. More boys are diagnosed with the condition than girls.

Research indicates that ASD most likely develops in the womb and that a mother’s diet during pregnancy could have an influence. But results from previous studies have been inconsistent, suggesting that other unmeasured factors (confounding), such as a mother’s overall health and lifestyle, could also play a role.

So an international research team set out to assess whether nutrient supplementation during pregnancy is associated with reduced risk of ASD, with and without intellectual disability.

They applied three analytical methods to a sample of 273,107 mother-child pairs living in Stockholm, Sweden. The sample was restricted to children who were 4 to 15 years of age by December 31 2011 and were born between 1996 and 2007.

Women reported their use of folic acid, iron, and multivitamin supplements at their first antenatal visit and cases of child ASD were identified from national registers.

After adjusting for several potentially influencing factors in both mothers and children, the researchers found that multivitamin use, with or without additional iron and/or folic acid, was associated with a lower likelihood of child ASD with intellectual disability relative to mothers who did not use folic acid, iron, and multivitamins.

There was no consistent evidence that either iron or folic acid use were associated with a reduced risk of ASD.

The results of the various analyses seemed to be consistent with each other, say the authors, suggesting that the association between multivitamins and ASD might not be fully explained by confounding.

They point to several study limitations, such as the potential for confounding and difficulty assessing type, timing and dose of supplements. However strengths included the relatively large population-based sample size and the advanced analytical methods used to gauge the robustness of findings.

“Together, the three analyses appear to point toward a potential inverse association between multivitamin use with ASD with intellectual disability,” say the authors.

Given the current understanding and strength of evidence supporting the importance of nutritional supplementation during pregnancy, “it is impossible to imagine that these results, on their own, should change current practice,” they write. However, they say these findings “raise questions that warrant investigation” and call for verification in randomised studies “before recommending a change to current practice.”

"Regular exercise may prevent many cases of future depression, according to a new Australian study, and researchers say that as little as one hour a week can make a real difference.

The paper, published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, followed more than 22,000 healthy Norwegian adults without symptoms of anxiety or depression for an average of 11 years, asking them about their exercise habits and symptoms of depression and anxiety at the beginning and end of the study.

At the start, about 12% said they didn’t exercise, and the rest said they exercised anywhere from “up to 30 minutes” to “more than 4 hours” a week.

Over the next decade, about 7% of people in the study developed depression, and about 9% developed anxiety. No relationship was observed between exercise and later anxiety, but the researchers did find a link between exercise and later depression.

People who said they didn’t exercise at the study’s start were 44% more likely to become depressed, compared to those who exercised at least 1 to 2 hours a week. For people who worked out more, no additional benefits were observed.

The study could not prove a cause-and-effect relationship between exercise and the risk of depression, but the authors say it strongly suggests one—especially because they controlled for other potential factors, including age, gender, social support, smoking, drinking and body mass index.

If their hypothesis is right, they say, 12% of depression cases could be prevented if everyone got just one hour of exercise a week.

That exercise doesn’t have to be intense, either, they say. People seemed to have mental health benefits from physical activity regardless of whether they reported working out to the point of exhaustion or barely breaking a sweat.

“Given that the intensity of exercise does not appear to be important,” the authors wrote in their paper, “it may be that the most effective public health measures are those that encourage and facilitate increased levels of everyday activities, such as walking or cycling.”

Of course, there are other benefits to more frequent and more intense bouts of exercise. Both the American Heart Association and the World Health Organization recommend getting at least 150 minutes of moderate- to high-intensity physical activity a week for cardiovascular and overall health.

But when it comes to mental health benefits, “the majority of the protective effect comes from the first one or two hours of exercise each week,” said study author Samuel Harvey, associate professor of workplace mental health at the Black Dog Institute and the University of New South Wales, in an email.

MORE: A New Hope For Depression

The authors write that the combined physical and social benefits of exercise are likely responsible for its ability to help stave off depression. It’s also possible, they add, that exercise may trigger changes in self-esteem, the release of mood-boosting endorphins and the production of certain proteins.

“There is good evidence that physical activity can help people recover from depression, though we recommend it be used in addition to the usual treatments we would prescribe for established depression, like medication and counseling,” says Harvey. “Our study takes this a bit further and shows that exercise may also have a role in preventing people developing depression in the first place.”

"Like spicy foods? If so, science has some good news for you: Eating hot chili peppers may help you live longer.

A new study, published in PLoS ONE, found that consumption of hot red chili peppers was associated with a 13 percent lower risk of death.

The research is observational, so no cause and effect relationship can be established. Still, the authors say the study strengthens the growing body of evidence that spicy food may have protective health properties that can lead to a longer life.

For the study, researchers at the Larner College of Medicine at the University of Vermont analyzed data on more than 16,000 Americans using the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES). Participants were followed for an average of 18.9 years.

The researchers note that people who ate hot red chili peppers tended to be “younger, male, white, Mexican-American, married, and to smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, and consume more vegetables and meats . . . had lower HDL-cholesterol, lower income, and less education,” in comparison to participants who did not consume red chili peppers.

Though the mechanism by which chili peppers could help delay death is not well understood, there are some theories.

Previous, mostly experimental research has suggested that spices and their bioactive ingredient, capsaicin, have anti-obesity, antioxidant, anti-inflammation and anti-cancer properties.

The authors say capsaicin also possesses antimicrobial properties that “may indirectly affect the host by altering the gut microbiota.”

The research corroborates a 2015 study conducted in China and published in the BMJ that found regular consumption of spicy food is associated with a lower risk of death.

But experts caution that this doesn’t mean everyone should pile on the spices at dinner time to improve their health and increase their longevity. People with gastrointestinal issues, for example, should hold off on the hot sauce.

“For those who are affected by digestive disorders such as a stomach ulcer, I would be cautious about eating spicy foods,” Lu Qi, of Harvard’s T. H. Chan School of Public Health and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, and lead author of The BMJ study, told CBS News.

The authors suggest further research should investigate the benefits of other spices and the effects of certain chili pepper subtypes.

“Such evidence may lead to new insights into the relationships between diet and health, updated dietary recommendations, and the development of new therapies,” they write."

"There’s growing evidence that concussions may have more lasting effects than previously thought, and that monitoring people with head injuries, no matter how apparently minor, is crucial to ensuring they receive proper treatment and minimize the effects of the trauma.

But there aren’t good ways to distinguish between mild blows that don’t require additional care and mild to moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI), which could have more serious consequences. Currently, CT scans of the brain are the standard way of diagnosing TBI, but they can’t pick up every case. And because the expose patients to radiation, doctors are often reluctant to use them on every patient, especially young children, who come to the emergency room with a head injury.

But in a study published in JAMA Neurology, scientists report on a promising blood test that could distinguish the more serious cases of TBI that require further evaluation. Led by Dr. Linda Papa, director of clinical research and an emergency physician at Orlando Regional Medical Center, the research team focused on two blood proteins that have already been linked to brain injury. Papa and her team expanded on that work by studying how levels of these two proteins, or biomarkers, change immediately after head trauma.

They collected blood from 584 people coming to the Orlando Regional Medical Center, which is a Level 1 Trauma Center, for trauma-related injuries. About half them had brain-related injuries, and half had other traumas, including broken bones and chest injuries. Papa wanted to test several things about the blood test, including whether they were specific to brain injuries or whether they changed during any trauma to any part of the body. All of the people had their blood drawn 19 times, starting at within four hours of their injury and up to 7 days later. By tracking changes in the levels of the two proteins over this time, Papa could see how they changed, and correlate that with the people’s symptoms.

In all people, regardless of the type of injury they had, the levels of the proteins, called GFAP and UCH-L1, rose within the first hour after the injuries. GFAP, which is specific to cells known as astrocytes that form a matrix for nerves in the central nervous system (which includes the brain and spinal cord), peak at 20 hours after the injury and then decline steadily but are still detectable seven days later. UCH-L1 is released by brain nerves when they’re stressed, and its levels rise more rapidly immediately after injury and peak at eight hours.

When Papa then looked just at people who showed signs of TBI on CT scans, she found that their levels of GFAP and UCH-L1 were significantly higher than those of people with other types of trauma, suggesting that the two markers can be relatively specific to TBI and not trauma in general.

“We don’t want to do any unnecessary procedures on people who don’t need them,” says Papa of using CT scans to distinguish people with more serious head injuries from those how just have hit their head but don’t experience any symptoms. “I don’t think a blood will be the be-all and end-all but it would be a beautiful tool for us to have in the clinic to support a lot of our decision making.”

Testing for levels of UCH-L1, for example, might be helpful for emergency medical teams in an ambulance trying to assess whether a patient has any serious head injuries, since its levels peak in the hours immediately after a trauma. It might also help coaches or athletic trainers are sports events to determine which athletes who have had a concussion are able to return to the game and which, if they have higher levels of the blood marker, should not.

MORE: A New Blood Test to Diagnose Concussions On The Field

In the emergency room, a blood test for UCH-L1 could also help doctors decide which patients should get a CT scan — the higher their levels of the protein are, the more likely they are to have TBI and would benefit from a scan, while those with lower levels probably don’t need one.

And because levels of GFAP tend to remain higher for many days, Papa says it might be useful in cases where patients don’t come in immediately after a head injury, thinking they’re okay, but see the doctor several days later because they’re concerned. Even at that point, the study shows, GFAP levels might be higher than normal and therefore might indicate TBI and need for further tests.

“We may not use these blood tests in a hundred percent of cases but probably in eighty percent of cases where there is a question mark, a blood test could definitely help,” she says.

"Two blood-building drugs injected soon after birth may give tiny preemies a lasting long-term edge, boosting brain development and IQ by age 4, a first-of-its-kind study found.

The study was small but the implications are big if larger, longer studies prove the drugs help even the playing field for these at-risk children, the researchers and other experts say.

Babies who got the medicine scored much better by age 4 on measures of intelligence, language and memory than preemies who didn't get it. The medicine group's scores on an important behavior measure were just as good as a control group of 4-year-olds born on time at a normal weight.

The results are ""super exciting,"" said Dr. Robin Ohls, the lead author and a pediatrics professor at the University of New Mexico. She said it's the first evidence of long-term benefits of the drugs when compared to no blood-boosting treatment.

Even though the treated youngsters didn't do as well as the normal-weight group on most measures, their scores were impressive and suggest greater brain development than the other preemies, Ohls said.

They scored about 12 points higher on average on IQ tests than the untreated kids but about 10 points lower than the normal-weight group. On tests measuring memory and impulsive behavior, the treated kids fared as well as those born at normal weight.

Here's how those differences would show up in a preschool setting: The untreated group would be the kids who struggle a little in class, while the those who got the medicines would do OK but not as well as those born at a normal weight, said Dr. Michael Schreiber, a prematurity expert at the University of Chicago's Comer Children's Hospital.

Survival of extremely tiny preemies has improved dramatically in the past 50 years, but treatment for medical problems and developmental delays linked with prematurity has not kept pace, Schreiber said. He was not involved in the study.

He said larger studies including more diverse patient populations are needed to determine if the drugs can help a broader range of preemies.

The study involved 53 children, most white or Hispanic, born more than a month premature and weighing less than 3 pounds at hospitals in New Mexico, Utah and Colorado. Two dozen normal-weight children were also included.

Results were published Monday in Pediatrics.

Shortly after birth the preemies were randomly assigned to receive injections of either erythropoeitin (EPO), three times weekly; darbepoetin once a week for several weeks; or no treatment. The drugs build red blood cells and are approved to treat anemia caused by cancer treatment or resulting from other conditions.

Preemies lack the ability to make new red blood cells and often need frequent blood transfusions to replace blood taken for lab tests. The drugs are now sometimes used to try to reduce their need for transfusions, in doses similar to the ones studied.

The drugs can increase endurance by boosting oxygen levels in the blood, and have been implicated in some sports doping scandals.

Dr. Sandra Juul, a University of Washington pediatrics professor, is leading a larger multi-center study of both drugs in preemies and said it's too soon to recommend the medicines for treating developmental delays.

Still, since almost half of infants born extremely early have significant developmental problems, any treatment that could improve their lives ""is incredibly important,"" Juul said.

"Eating a high-fiber diet as a teenager, including lots of fruits and vegetables, may be another tool to help women lower their risk for later breast cancer.

A new study looking at diet and health data from more than 44,000 women found that those who reported consuming the highest amount of fiber during high school, about 28 grams a day, had a significantly lower risk of breast cancer before menopause compared with those who said they ate less than 15 grams a day.

The researchers from Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health, whose study appears in the journal Pediatrics, analyzed data from a large, ongoing, national study of nurses focused on factors that influence women's health.

""The results of this study emphasize the role of an early life high-fiber diet on prevention of breast cancer in later life. High consumption of foods rich in fiber such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains in early life may help to reduce breast cancer incidence,"" lead author Maryam Farvid, a visiting scientist at Harvard, told CBS News.

The findings showed that breast cancer risk was 12 to 19 percent lower among women who ate more dietary fiber in their youth, depending on how much more they ate. Eating more fiber during adolescence was linked to a 16 percent lower risk of breast cancer overall, and a 24 percent lower risk of breast cancer before menopause.

Farvid said the findings show that each additional 10 grams per day increase in fiber intake during adolescence reduced the risk of breast cancer by 14 percent.

""Having the recommended 25 to 30 grams of fiber daily would decrease the risk by 30 percent and potentially even greater with higher fiber intake,"" Farvid said. ""Women are doing themselves a huge favor in terms of breast cancer prevention if they increase the amount of dietary fiber intake earlier in life rather than later.""

Eating more fruits and vegetables was especially beneficial, the researchers said.

Healthy high-fiber food choices include apples, pears, raspberries, artichokes, green peas, broccoli, split peas, lentils, beans, whole wheat pasta, whole grain bread, brown rice, bran flakes, and oatmeal.

Why would these foods have such an impact?

In an accompanying editorial, Duke University Medical Center's Dr. Kimberly Blackwell said there's longstanding evidence that dietary fiber may cut down on circulating estrogen levels through changes in the gut microbiome.

She said that recently more evidence has come to light suggesting a relationship between dietary fiber and breast cancer risk, and that eating more fiber would be a simple way to reduce risk.

One weakness she pointed out in the study is that the women were asked to recall details about their adolescent diet when they were in their 30s and 40s. Nevertheless, Blackwell said, ""It is reasonable for pediatricians to encourage a high-fiber diet and include decreasing breast cancer risk as one of the potential benefits.""

Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital, in New York, told CBS News, ""It lends support to the fact that we need to encourage people to start healthy habits earlier on.""

Dr. Deanna Attai, assistant clinical professor of surgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles, said that while it's an observational study, not a clinical intervention, its larger point about diet and health is important.

""The sexy headline is eat this and you'll have a lower risk of breast cancer, but I'd shift the focus to, eat more fiber because it's better for you and you'll be a healthier person and you're less likely to be obese and have chronic inflammation and other things that will reduce your risk for heart disease and cancer along the way,"" said Attai.

She added, ""The message is a good one as far as increasing fiber, but it also has to be put in perspective. This is just one mechanism by which we can reduce risk and it does warrant further study."""

"Newswise — Chicago — A single breath may be all it takes to identify the return of lung cancer after surgery, according to a study posted online today by The Annals of Thoracic Surgery.

Exhaled breath contains thousands of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that vary in composition and pattern depending on a person’s health status. A subset of four VOCs—called carbonyl compounds because of their carbon base—have been discovered in the exhaled breath of lung cancer patients. Being able to identify this lung cancer “signature” through a simple breath test has emerged as one of the most promising ways to diagnose the disease. Now the test is being used to monitor for disease recurrence.

Erin M. Schumer, MD, MPH, Victor van Berkel, MD, PhD, and colleagues from the University of Louisville analyzed breath samples collected before and after surgery from 31 lung cancer patients and compared their carbonyl VOCs levels with samples from 187 healthy patients.

The researchers found a significant decrease in overall carbonyl VOC levels following surgery; in fact, three of the four carbonyl VOCs normalized after surgery, matching levels in the control group.

“The rapid normalization of almost all of the four compounds after surgery provides strong evidence that they are directly produced by the tumor environment,” said Dr. Schumer. “This study confirms that the technology is accurate.”

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death. The American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates that more than 224,000 Americans will be diagnosed with lung cancer this year, and more than 158,000 lung cancer patients will die—that translates to 433 lung cancer deaths per day in the United States.

Dr. Schumer said those grim statistics underscore the need for early detection, “We hope that breath analysis will allow us to diagnose patients with primary or recurrent lung cancer long before they suffer from symptoms, when we have more options for treating them, giving them the best chance for cure.”

Currently, lung cancer patients are followed after surgery with chest computed tomography (CT) scans, which can be inconvenient, expensive, and expose the patient to radiation. “We hope that the breath analysis can serve as the primary screening tool for cancer recurrence and a CT scan ordered only if the breath test suggests that there has been a change,” said Dr. van Berkel.

How the Breath Test WorksThe process of breath analysis is relatively simple. The patient blows a single breath into a specialized balloon. The balloon is then connected to a pump that pulls the breath over a small microchip (smaller than a quarter), trapping the chemicals. The microchip is sent to the lab, where the chemicals are analyzed within hours. Breath collection can be performed in the doctor’s office. The pump is reusable; the balloon, microchip, and lab test together cost around $20, all supporting the increasing acceptance of breath tests as a cost-effective, easy-to-perform, non-invasive, and rapid option for the diagnosis of lung cancer.

“The great potential with breath analysis is detecting lung cancer at any point, both as a primary screening tool and to follow patients after disease has been treated,” said Dr. van Berkel. “The technology is pretty robust. Our next step is getting approval from the FDA.”

Lung Cancer Breath ‘Signature’ Presents Promise for Earlier Diagnosis	2020-05-04 00:00:00	http://www.newswise.com/articles/view/654665/?sc=mwhn	news_reviews_00414	true
"ROCHESTER, Minn. — A new type of blood test may help physicians identify which patients with and without evidence of coronary blockages are at risk for heart attacks and strokes. Even individuals with normal levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), known as the so-called “bad” cholesterol, but still at risk, seem to be identified, according to Mayo Clinic research being presented at the American College of Cardiology’s 66th Annual Scientific Session.

The test, released commercially by Mayo Medical Laboratories in August 2016, measures blood concentrations of plasma ceramides, a class of lipids that are highly linked to cardiovascular disease processes. The study found that individuals with the highest levels of blood ceramides were found to have a 3- to 4-times greater risk of having a cardiovascular event compared with those with the lowest ceramide score, regardless of their LDL cholesterol level or the presence of a blockage in the heart’s arteries.

“Our research suggests that evaluating ceramide levels in patients who are not at immediate risk for coronary artery disease events may help cardiologists decide who could benefit from proactive and preventive treatment, such as statins, or lifestyle changes to prevent a serious cardiac event down the road,” says Jeff Meeusen, Ph.D., a clinical chemist, co-director of Cardiovascular Laboratory Medicine at Mayo Clinic and the study’s lead author.

According to Dr. Meeusen, ceramides are different than cholesterol, which gathers and causes a clog in the arteries. Ceramides are more active, attracting inflammatory cells and promoting clotting.

In the study, 499 Mayo Clinic patients who were referred for coronary angiography to check for possible artery blockages were included and followed prospectively for approximately eighteen years. Patients were similar in age and with regard to blood pressure, smoking status and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), the “good” cholesterol; excluded were those who had diabetes or a previous heart attack, stroke or procedure to open narrowed coronary arteries. Researchers measured four different types of ceramides in the blood at baseline and combined the values into a 12-point scale. Patients were grouped into four risk categories according to their ceramide levels: low (0–2), intermediate (3–6), moderate (7–9) and high (10–12).

Over the eighteen years, researchers recorded occurrences of heart attack, stroke, revascularization and death. Overall, 5.1 percent of patients had a major cardiovascular event each year. But the risk of having an event became higher as ceramide level increased; for each 1-point increase in the ceramide risk score, the risk rose by 9 percent. The rate of events was double among people with the highest ceramide score compared with those with the lowest (8.1 vs. 4.1 percent, respectively).

In patients without coronary artery disease following angiography, the rate of cardiovascular events was only 3.1 percent, lower than the average overall. But when researchers examined cardiovascular disease in this population by ceramide scores, people with the highest levels of ceramides were four times more likely to have an event compared with those with the lowest (7.8 vs. 2.2 percent, respectively). A similar trend was seen among people with low LDL levels (<100 mg/dL), typically considered a good LDL target. In this group, the rate of heart attack, stroke and revascularization and death was 3.7 percent among those with a low ceramide score, but 16.4 percent in people with the highest ceramide levels.

“There is a need to identify patients at increased risk for cardiovascular events so that we can test strategies to prevent those events. This test seems to provide such information,” says Allan S. Jaffe, M.D., senior author of the study, cardiologist at Mayo Clinic and chair of the Division of Clinical Core Laboratory Services.

The trial was funded by Mayo Clinic. The new test is available to health care providers worldwide through Mayo Medical Laboratories, which offers laboratory testing and pathology services to more than 4,000 health care organizations in more than 70 countries. Mayo Medical Laboratories collaborated with some of the original researchers who established the role of ceramides in cardiovascular disease and Zora Biosciences Oy, a diagnostics discovery company based in Finland, to develop and refine the test. The present study is also the first to test its clinical utility in a U.S. population.

"Giving school children access to chilled, self-serve water may help chip away at childhood obesity, a new study of more than one million New York City school students suggests.

The study, published in JAMA Pediatrics, analyzed data collected from 1,227 elementary and middle schools across New York City - some with and some without ""water jets."" The large, clear, electrically cooled jugs with a push lever for fast dispensing were placed in 483 school cafeterias, about 40 percent of schools during the 2008-2009 and the 2012-2013 school years.

Schools with water dispensers saw a modest weight drop among students, according to the study by researchers from NYU Langone Medical Center, New York University's Institute for Education and Social Policy, and the Center for Policy Research at Syracuse University's Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs.

""We associated these water dispensers with almost a one percentage point reduction in the likelihood of being overweight for boys and a little over a half a percentage point reduction for girls,"" said lead researcher Brian Elbel, an associate professor of population health and health policy at NYU School of Medicine.

Doctors' advice for preventing childhood obesity

""Even a small, straightforward, relatively inexpensive policy intervention was associated with a small but statistically significant drop,"" Elbel told CBS News.

Water jets also were linked with a decrease in the amount of half-pints of milk students bought, which could be a potential mechanism of weight reduction, the researchers found.

Modern water dispensers may be more effective than old-fashioned water fountains since water quality and cleanliness may deter kids from using older fountains, and they're not as efficient at serving large numbers of children, experts noted in an accompanying editorial.

The editorial, entitled ""Power of a Simple Intervention to Improve Student Health: Just Add Water,"" said the study's findings are significant.

""Sometimes, a very simple intervention can have a powerful effect,"" wrote Lindsey Turner, of Boise State University, in Idaho, and Erin Hager, from the University of Maryland School of Medicine, in Baltimore.

""The study by Schwartz and colleagues in this issue of JAMA Pediatrics adds to a growing body of evidence supporting the importance of providing drinking water access in schools. In this study, the findings demonstrate that water access in schools can promote healthy weight outcomes among students,"" Turner and Hager said."

"(CNN) -- If you've just had your first heart attack, doctors may one day be able to reverse the damage done with stem cell therapy.

An intravenous method of injecting stem cells into patients who had experienced heart attacks within the previous 10 days suggested that this method works to repair -- not just manage -- heart damage, a recent study found.

The study is a step forward in a field in which a lot of approaches have been tried in animals and preliminary human trials, but none has been approved for widespread clinical use for heart patients.

The new results are a milestone in stem cell research, and for patients, said Jeffrey Karp, a researcher at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, who runs a stem cell biology lab at Harvard University. He was not involved in the study.

Most current clinical approaches are focused on managing problems, not addressing the root of the damage, he said.

""Many patients who have a heart attack will go on to suffer heart failure,"" he said. ""It's imperative to try and fix the root of the problem as quickly as possible.""

The research, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, were part of a phase I study that set out to show safety. The trial has moved on to phase II, which is taking place in 50 hospitals in the United States, said Dr. Joshua Hare, director of the Interdisciplinary Stem Cell Institute at the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine and lead author of the study.

""We're looking on the time frame here of five years, in the best-case scenario, to have approved cardiac stem cell therapies,"" Hare said.

Coronary heart disease, which causes heart attacks and angina -- chest pain resulting from the heart not getting enough blood -- is the leading cause of death in the United States, with nearly 450,000 in 2005, according to the American Heart Association. About 1.1 million people have attacks occur in the United States each year, according to the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute.

The particular kind of cells used in this research are called mesenchymal stem cells, and come from adults, not embryos.

The researchers are using a mesenchymal stem cell therapy that is marketed by Osiris Therapeutics Inc. under the name Prochymal. The drug, which consists of stem cells from donor bone marrow, gets injected into the vein. The cells then travel through the bloodstream and take up residence in the heart.

Mesenchymal stem cells have some natural homing capability, and injury serves as a homing beacon for them, Karp said.

The stem cells reduce the amount of scar tissue and increase the pumping strength of the heart in heart attack patients, Hare said. To a limited extent, they also grow new heart muscle.

The phase I results from 53 patients are not definitive proof that the treatment is effective, but do suggest so, Hare said. In accordance with clinical trial regulations set by the Food and Drug Administration, phase I is meant to show safety, while phase II and phase III trials are done on a larger group of subjects and evaluate how well the drug works.

In this trial, patients' doses ranged from 35 million cells to 350 million cells. There was no change or increase in side effects in treatments getting higher doses of cells, but it seemed that the treatment was more effective -- at least in terms of reducing electrical problems -- in the high dose group, he said.

In separate trials, researchers are looking at how the technique works in patients who have had heart attacks many month or years in the past, Hare said.

The study shows the results of a six-month follow-up with patients in 2007, and researchers are presently working with data from the two-year follow-up.

More broadly, besides bone marrow transplantations, there have not been any major successes in the stem cell field in terms of helping large numbers of patients, Karp said.

""Mesenchymal stem cells are poised to really be the next major success in cell therapy that could be used to treat tens of thousands of patients,"" he said.

There are several advantages to using mesenchymal stem cells for heart therapy. First, they are adult stem cells, so there are no ethical issues that surround research on embryonic stem cells. Secondly, at least from a safety perspective, mesenchymal stem cells do not require matching -- any donor can give cells to any other donor, and no immunosuppresant drugs are necessary, he said.

Still, millions of cells are required in order for enough stem cells to reach the heart and have a therapeutic benefit, and it's costly to get the required numbers of cells for each patient, Karp said. An area of improvement would be making the stem cell treatment more efficient, he said.

""If we could increase the number of cells that could reach the heart, that would have significant advantages to this approach,"" Karp said.

This method of intravenous injection means that the procedure theoretically could be performed in a doctor's office or clinic, increasing the accesibility to patients, Karp said.

A more invasive stem cell delivery technique has been showing positive results in other clinical trials, involving injecting patients' own stem cells directly into heart muscle.

The largest national stem cell study for heart disease, sponsored by Baxter Inc., uses this surgical method, and recently announced success in a 12-month phase II trial for patients with severe angina. Researchers found that participants had less pain and an improved ability to walk.

Because stem cells are delivered through a catheter in this method, there is a risk of perforation of about 1 percent, Dr. Douglas Losordo, cardiologist at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, told CNN earlier this year. The drug, GCSF, which mobilizes stem cells, also carries a small risk of blood clotting.

For the Osiris trials, further research is ongoing determine whether patients would benefit more from more infusions of the stem cells, or if it's better for the stem cells to come from their own bodies instead of from a donor, Hare said.

While there's less chance of a person's body rejecting his or her own stem cells than from a donor, there is a time delay, he said. Taking bone marrow and amplifying the stem cells in it could take up to five weeks, whereas donor cells could be made readily available, he said. On the other hand, it is unclear whether a donor could potentially transmit a disease to the recipient in the process.

If you are interested in enrolling in a clinical trial, you can find one at clinicaltrials.gov. The Orisis trial is still recruiting participants."

"Women who want to quit smoking may find it easier if they time their efforts just right. A new study finds hormone fluctuations that occur over the course of a woman's menstrual cycle may impact her ability to kick the cigarette habit.

According to small study conducted by researchers at the University of Montreal, women are more likely to crave cigarettes and have trouble quitting when in the follicular phase of their monthly cycle. This is the time right after her period and before ovulation.

""While overall more men than women smoke cigarettes, women and girls take less time to become dependent after initial use and have more difficulties quitting the habit,"" the researchers write in their study. ""One of the factors contributing to these differences may be that women crave cigarettes more than men and that their desire to smoke is influenced by hormonal fluctuations across the menstrual cycle.""

The study, which was published in Psychiatry Journal, involved 19 women and 15 men who were all chronic smokers but otherwise healthy. None of the study participants were enrolled in a smoking cessation program or were trying to quit.

Researchers asked each participant to smoke one cigarette 30 to 40 minutes before undergoing an fMRI, or brain scan. They were asked to view photos both related and unrelated to smoking. After undergoing the brain scans they viewed the photos a second time and reported on a scale from zero to 100 if the pictures triggered cigarette cravings.

The researchers tested 13 of the female participants twice to assess how their response changed at a different point in their menstrual cycle.

The brain scans showed that during the follicular stage, cigarette imagery activated five areas of the brain which the researchers say are linked to higher-level cravings. However during the luteal phase -- after a woman ovulates and before her period -- only one area of the brain was activated by images of cigarettes and smoking.

During the luteal phase, estrogen and progesterone levels are at their highest, which may help a woman keep addictive cravings at bay and reduce feelings of cigarette withdrawal.

Previous studies have found women's monthly hormone fluctuations can affect everything from food cravings and digestive problems to joint pain and a whole host of other health issues.

""This result emphasizes the need for gender-specific programs to quit smoking, as well as taking into consideration a menstrual cycle phase during addiction treatment in women,"" the researchers conclude. They called for more studies to help understand all the factors that contribute to sex and gender differences in smoking."

"Vitamin B and its role in improving memory Studies show a B vitamin cocktail may stave off cognitive decline. Nutrition lab

Anyone looking for an easy way to boost brain power is likely to come across an increasingly common piece of advice: Up your intake of B vitamins.

Forgot where you left your keys? The name of your neighbor's kid? Whether you locked the car?

The vitamins — including folic acid and vitamins B6 and B12 — are often touted as a way to improve memory and stave off cognitive decline. The claims are based on the finding that levels of the vitamin are low in people with various forms of cognitive impairment, including dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

But experts say it's still unclear whether taking high doses of the vitamins will keep such conditions at bay.

""I don't know that people need to rush out and buy B vitamins — I don't think we're ready [for that] yet,"" says Mary Haan, an epidemiology professor at UC San Francisco who has studied the relationship between B vitamin intake and cognitive function in elderly adults.

Researchers believe B vitamins may affect brain health because of their ability to lower blood levels of an amino acid called homocysteine. In the 1990s, several studies documented high levels of homocysteine in people with cognitive impairment and dementia. But at the time, scientists didn't know whether high levels of the amino acid caused cognitive decline or whether cognitive decline caused people to accumulate high levels of the amino acid.

To determine which came first, researchers at Boston University followed approximately 1,100 healthy adults who were enrolled in the ongoing Framingham Heart Study, which began in 1948 to identify risk factors for heart disease. At the end of eight years, the researchers found that the rates of dementia and Alzheimer's disease were higher in people who had had high homocysteine levels compared with those who had low levels. Their conclusions — that high homocysteine levels increase a person's risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease — were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2002.

Since then, a handful of studies have administered high doses of homocysteine-lowering B vitamins to subjects in order to determine the vitamins' effects on brain function. The results have so far been mixed, with only a minority of studies showing a benefit, says Joshua Miller, a professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at UC Davis who studies the vitamins."

"NEW YORK -- A new study says yoga may be as good a treatment for back pain as physical therapy.

One person who might agree is 74-year-old Judith Zaborowski, who took up yoga more than 10 years ago to help with her aching back.

""I'm much more comfortable with movement,"" she told CBS News. ""Yoga makes me think about my back and how I'm standing and if I'm standing properly, then I can function better.""

In the study, 320 adults with moderate to severe back pain received one of three approaches over 12 weeks:

Weekly yoga classes



15 physical therapy visits



Education about how to cope with back pain



CBS News

Yoga was just as effective as physical therapy -- and both groups were about 20 percent less likely to use pain medication than patients receiving education alone.

Yoga classes started with relaxation exercises, warm up, then gentle yoga poses like wall dog and chair twist.

Dr. Robert Saper CBS News

Dr. Robert Saper at Boston Medical Center is one of the authors. He explained the results.

""Yoga was as effective as physical therapy for reducing pain intensity,"" Saper said. ""Perhaps most importantly reducing pain medication use.""

Saper says yoga likely works by strengthening core and lower back muscles and helping with mind-body relaxation.

""I feel, the more that one can do for one's self and not depend on medication, the healthier it is for your body,"" Zaborowski said.

"Portable gluten tester from 6SensorLabs. 6SensorLabs

Restaurants, office parties, potlucks, meals while traveling -- they're a minefield for people with celiac disease and gluten sensitivity who can suffer from stomach pain and upset, swollen joints, and other debilitating health problems when they ingest even a little bit of gluten.

The maker of a new handheld gluten-detecting device hopes to help make eating outside of a gluten-sensitive individual's own kitchen safer and easier.

The company, 6SensorLabs, has started taking pre-orders for the device it calls Nima, which can test food for gluten and get rapid results, said co-founder and chief technology officer Scott Sundvor.

Nima is not FDA-approved and it's not intended for medical use, but the company intends it as a ""consumer"" tool to use when dining out, Sundvor said.

""One of the things that we wanted to make sure we distinguish is that we don't see ourselves as a medical device,"" Sundvor told CBS News. ""So we do not need FDA clearance for the device because we are not using it to diagnose or manage disease. We're simply providing a product to help people know what's in their food and guide their habits.""

Gluten-free diners can place a sample of food into a capsule or ""test pod"" and then insert the capsule into a black, triangular device that basically acts like a mini chemistry test. In about two minutes, Sundvor said Nima can tell if the food sample has 20 parts per million or more of gluten. A smiley face means it's OK; a frowning face means it doesn't pass muster.

As a point of reference, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires manufacturers who choose to put a ""gluten free"" label on food packaging to meet the same 20 parts per million of gluten standard.

Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. People with celiac disease experience an immune reaction when they eat gluten that can lead to intestinal damage and impact the health of other organs if it's not managed well. It can cause stomach pain, a swollen belly, acid reflux, diarrhea, skin problems, and other symptoms.

The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases estimates that about 1 in 141 Americans has celiac disease, but many people don't know they have the condition. Gluten-sensitive people experience similar symptoms to those with celiac disease and improve when they eliminate gluten from their diets.

Nima is triangular and relatively dainty, about three and a half inches tall by three inches wide, and a little less than an inch thick. ""Small enough to fit into your pocket along with your keys and mobile phone or a small clutch,"" said Sundvor.

Nima was first conceived when Sundvor and company co-founder Shireen Yates met about two years ago and realized they both had gluten intolerance and other food issues.

""We met at MIT through mutual friends. She was getting her MBA and I'd gotten my engineering degree from there. We had this shared experience; Shireen has several food allergies and I also have several food intolerances. We both just had these issues where we'd eat out and get sick or feel uncomfortable,"" Sundvor said. ""Shireen had the idea, 'Why can't I just test my food and figure out what's in it?' So we started talking about the idea and we researched the market and realized it's something we could make happen.""

It costs $179 to pre-order a tester plus three one-time-use pods, and $47.95 for a refill pack of 12 pods; prices will increase later this month, according to the company's website. The company plans to deliver the product by the middle of next year after they've tested it more thoroughly, Sundvor.

Marilyn Grunzweig Geller, chief executive officer of the Celiac Disease Foundation, said she is not familiar with the new gluten-sensing device and was unable to comment on it directly.

""Certainly an FDA-approved device that could help people determine if they were accidentally ingesting gluten could go a long way to helping people and would be useful."" However, she adds, ""I would never comment on a device that's not FDA-approved.""

She said she's anecdotally aware of a number of ""treatments"" for celiac disease and has heard of gluten sensors, but is skeptical.

As for Nima, Sundvor said, ""We're doing a huge amount of testing and one thing we want to be sure of before we start shipping is that we're 99.9 percent accurate.""

He said they have received Nima prototypes and he and his girlfriend, who has celiac disease, are already trying it out.

The company also aims to create similar versions that could test for peanut and dairy allergens, among other problematic ingredients. A Nima app is in the works, too, that he says will let users share information about restaurants and log their results."

MONDAY, June 14 (HealthDay News) -- A drug commonly used to prevent excess bleeding in surgeries could keep thousands of people from bleeding to death after trauma, a new study suggests.

The drug, tranexamic acid (TXA) is cheap, widely available around the world and easily administered, experts said. It works by significantly reducing the rate at which blood clots break down, the researchers explained.

""When people have serious injuries, whether from accidents or violence, and when they have severe hemorrhage they can bleed to death. This treatment reduces the chances of bleeding to death by about a sixth, "" said researcher Dr. Ian Roberts, a professor of epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in the U.K.

According to Roberts, each year about 600,000 people bleed to death worldwide. ""So, if you could reduce that by a sixth, you've saved 100,000 lives in one year,"" he said.

The report, which was primarily funded by philanthropic groups and the British government, is published in the June 15 online edition of The Lancet.

For the study, Roberts and colleagues in the CRASH-2 consortium randomly assigned more than 20,000 trauma patients from 274 hospitals across 40 countries to injections of either TXA or placebo.

Among patients receiving TXA, the rate of death from any cause was cut by 10 percent compared to patients receiving placebo, the researchers found. In the TXA group, 14.5 percent of the patients died compared with 16 percent of the patients in the placebo group.

When the researchers looked at deaths from bleeding, those in the TXA group experienced a 15 percent reduction in mortality. Among patients receiving TXA, 4.9 percent died from bleeding, compared with 5.7 percent of the patients receiving placebo, they found.

Although there was some worry that TXA might lead to more heart attacks, strokes or clots in the lungs, the researchers observed no such increase among patients getting the drug.

Dr. Jerrold H. Levy, deputy chair for research at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta and author of an accompanying journal editorial, said that, ""these data are really neat, because any therapy to reduce mortality in trauma is, I think, a major finding.""

Using this drug to treat trauma patients is a completely new idea, Levy said. ""I think people should consider it [TXA] following trauma on the basis of this study,"" he said.

Currently, TXA is not generally used in emergency rooms to treat trauma patients, but Roberts believes that this study could change that.

""It's not our job to tell doctors how to treat their patients, but this is a drug that is safe and effective in a condition where people have a high risk of death,"" he said.

The researchers believe that TXA could have even wider uses, such as reducing brain bleeds after brain injury. The drug could also be used to reduce postpartum bleeding, which the researchers say causes some 100,000 deaths a year worldwide.

In fact, a trial to see whether TXA can reduce postpartum bleeding has started, the team noted.

Levy however, cautioned that the results of this study apply only to TXA and do not mean that people should try similar drugs hoping for similar results.

""Everybody wants to be creative, but you have to look at the data, and they used TXA,"" Levy said. ""You can't get creative and say 'Ah, one of the other drugs will do the same thing' -- you don't know that, and that's one of my concerns.""

HealthDay Reporter

WEDNESDAY, July 20 (HealthDay News)-- An experimental drug for treating Alzheimer's disease that previously showed troubling side effects may actually be safe in the long run, researchers report.

The keys to the safety of the drug, bapineuzumab, may be lowering the dose and not giving it to patients with ApoE4, a gene mutation linked to Alzheimer's, according to two studies scheduled for presentation Wednesday at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease in Paris.

""The data from the open-label trial are encouraging. Patients were able to tolerate bapineuzumab for two to four additional years without the emergence of any new safety concerns,"" said Dr. Stephen Salloway, author of one of the studies. ""This is important because we are conceptualizing this drug as a long-term treatment for Alzheimer's disease.""

Encouraging does not translate into certainty, however, another expert pointed out.

""I think it is too early to tell from the data from this small Phase 2 safety trial,"" said Ian Murray, an assistant professor of neuroscience and experimental therapeutics at Texas A&M Health Science Center College of Medicine in College Station. ""We will have to wait for larger trials to comment on this as a potential therapy.""

The studies were funded by Pfizer Inc. and Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy.

Although bapineuzumab has shown promise in certain Alzheimer's patients, other research found that patients taking a higher dose of the drug had an increased risk of brain inflammation from water retention. This resulted in headache, memory loss, hallucinations, reduced coordination or other symptoms. But no problems were seen with lower doses.

Bapineuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody, which binds to and might be able to eliminate beta amyloid peptide in the brains of people with Alzheimer's. Most experts believe that the build up of beta amyloid proteins, which accumulate as plaque, is responsible for Alzheimer's.

Salloway's study looked at the drug's safety in 194 Alzheimer's patients, most of whom had mild- to-moderate Alzheimer's and participated in a long-term (78 weeks or longer) study. Some of the participants were followed for four years or more.

Ninety-one percent of participants had side effects, about a quarter of which were attributable to bapineuzumab. Of these, 85 percent were mild or moderate.

The overall rate of vasogenic edema (water on the brain) was 9.3 percent, a number that decreased over time, said Salloway, a professor of neurology and psychiatry at Alpert Medical School of Brown University and director of the Butler Hospital Memory and Aging Program in Providence, R.I. The edema was symptomless in most cases, he said.

The other study, which involved looking at more than 2,000 MRI scans from 262 patients, found 36 cases of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) may have been linked to the bapineuzumab.

These imaging abnormalities may indicate inflammation of the brain caused by water retention.

But only 8 of those 36 cases involved symptoms, and they were more likely to be found in patients with APOE-e4 who were taking higher doses of the drug. The likelihood of these effects diminished with additional infusions of lower-dose bapineuzumab.

""There is a growing sense that VE [vasogenic edema] or ARIA [amyloid-related imaging abnormalities] is a manageable side effect and may actually be a sign that the drug is clearing amyloid from the brain and the blood vessels,"" said Salloway. ""Treatment will require ongoing monitoring with MRI.""

The researchers, who said monitoring of bapineuzumab will continue, are now awaiting the results of a larger Phase III trial on the drug.

Because this study was presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

"The MIND diet: 10 foods that fight Alzheimer's (and 5 to avoid)





istockphoto Doctors have been saying for years that what you eat can affect the health of your heart. Now there's growing evidence that the same is true for your brain. A new study by researchers at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago shows a diet plan they developed -- appropriately called the MIND diet -- may reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease by as much as 53 percent. Even those who didn't stick to the diet perfectly but followed it ""moderately well"" reduced their risk of Alzheimer's by about a third. Diet appears to be just one of ""many factors that play into who gets the disease,"" said nutritional epidemiologist Martha Clare Morris, PhD, the lead author of the MIND diet study. Genetics and other factors like smoking, exercise and education also play a role. But the MIND diet helped slow the rate of cognitive decline and protect against Alzheimer's regardless of other risk factors. The study, published in the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia, looked at more than 900 people between the ages of 58 and 98 who filled out food questionnaires and underwent repeated neurological testing. It found participants whose diets most closely followed the MIND recommendations had a level of cognitive function the equivalent of a person 7.5 years younger. The MIND diet breaks its recommendations down into 10 ""brain healthy food groups"" a person should eat and five ""unhealthy food groups"" to avoid. It combines many elements of two other popular nutrition plans which have been proven to benefit heart health: the Mediterranean diet and the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet. (MIND stands for Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay.) But the MIND diet also differs from those plans in a few significant ways and proved more effective than either of them at reducing the risk of Alzheimer's. Click through to see which foods to eat -- and which ones to avoid -- for optimal brain health.

Green leafy vegetables istockphoto The MIND diet recommends frequent servings of green leafy vegetables. Kale, spinach, broccoli, collards and other greens are packed with vitamins A and C and other nutrients. At least two servings a week can help, and researchers found six or more servings a week provide the greatest brain benefits. The Mediterranean and DASH diets do not specifically recommend these types of vegetables, but the MIND diet study found that including greens in addition to other veggies made a difference in reducing the risk of Alzheimer's.

Other vegetables istockphoto Like other diets focused on weight loss and heart health, the MIND diet emphasizes the importance of vegetables for brain health. The researchers recommend eating a salad and at least one other vegetable every day to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's.

Nuts istockphoto Nuts are a good snack for brain health, according to the MIND diet study. Nuts contain healthy fats, fiber and antioxidants, and other studies have found they can help lower bad cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease. The MIND diet recommends eating nuts at least five times a week.

Berries istockphoto Berries are the only fruit specifically recommended in the MIND diet. ""Blueberries are one of the more potent foods in terms of protecting the brain,"" Morris said. She noted that strawberries have also shown benefits in past studies looking at the effect of food on cognitive function. The MIND diet recommends eating berries at least twice a week.

Beans istockphoto If beans aren't a regular part of your diet, they should be. High in fiber and protein, and low in calories and fat, they also help keep your mind sharp as part of the MIND diet. The researchers recommend eating beans three times a week to help reduce the risk of Alzheimer's.

Whole grains Tom Perkins Whole grains are a key component of the MIND diet. It recommends at least three servings a day.

Fish istockphoto The MIND diet study found eating fish at least once a week helps protect brain function. However, there's no need to go overboard; unlike the Mediterranean diet, which recommends eating fish almost every day, the MIND diet says once a week is enough.

Poultry Shaiith Poultry is another part of a brain-healthy eating plan, according to the MIND diet. It recommends two or more servings a week.

Olive oil istockphoto Olive oil beat out other forms of cooking oil and fats in the MIND diet. The researchers found people who used olive oil as their primary oil at home saw greater protection against cognitive decline.

Wine istockphoto Raise a toast to the MIND diet: it recommends a glass of wine every day. Just one, though. Wine rounds out the list of of 10 ""brain healthy"" food groups that help protect against Alzheimer's: green leafy vegetables, other vegetables, nuts, berries, beans, whole grains, fish, poultry, olive oil and wine. Now here are the five food groups it says you should avoid to reduce your risk of developing dementia...

Red meat juniart Red meat isn't banned in the MIND diet, but the researchers say you should limit consumption to no more than four servings a week to help protect brain health. That's more generous than the Mediterranean diet, which restricts red meat to just one serving a week.

Butter and stick margarine istockphoto Butter and stick margarine should be limited to less than a tablespoon per day on the MIND diet. Brain-healthy olive oil can often be used instead.

Cheese istockphoto Cheese may be delicious but it doesn't do your brain any favors, according to the MIND diet study. Eat cheese no more than once a week if you want to reduce your risk of Alzheimer's.

Pastries and sweets istockphoto You already know they're not so good for your waistline, and it turns out pastries and other sweets could have a negative effect on brain health as well. The MIND diet recommends limiting yourself to no more than five of these treats per week."

"Is there a 'natural' aid for diabetes? THE HEALTHY SKEPTIC

There's something about Type 2 diabetes that inspires creativity, innovation and promises from the alternative medicine industry. People who want to control their blood sugar without medications can choose from a huge variety of pills and elixirs. ""I hear new claims on a nearly daily basis,"" says Dr. Daniel Einhorn, clinical professor of medicine at UC San Diego and the president of the American Assn. of Clinical Endocrinologists. ""There's a constant market for new products.""

The product comes in two varieties, regular Sugar Crush and the milder Sugar Crush Daily. Users are instructed to drink 2.5 milliliters of regular Sugar Crush mixed with a glass of water right before breakfast and dinner every day. Sugar Crush Daily is recommended as a prelude to lunch and bedtime.

"(CNN) -- A new study released Thursday suggests mammograms might not be as effective in reducing deaths from breast cancer in women over 50 as previously thought.

The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, analyzed data from more than 40,000 women with breast cancer.

It concluded the availability of mammography screening corresponded with a reduction in the rate of death from breast cancer, ""but the screening itself accounted for only about a third of the total reduction.""

The study involved women in Norway between ages 50 and 69.

Researchers from Norway and Harvard University compared the death rates from breast cancer in four groups: one group of women from 1996 through 2005 who were living in Norwegian counties with screening; another group in the same time period who were living in counties without screening; and two similar groups from 1986 through 1995.

""Among women in the nonscreening group, there was an 18 percent reduction in the rate of death from breast cancer, as compared with the preceding 10-year period, presumably as a result of increased breast-cancer awareness, improved therapy, and the use of more sensitive diagnostic tools,"" the findings state. ""Among women in the screening group, there was a 28 percent reduction in mortality from breast cancer during the same period. Thus, the relative reduction in mortality that was causally related to the screening program alone was 10 percent.""

The publication notes that in 2002, the World Health Organization concluded that mammography screening for women between ages 50 and 69 reduced the death rate from breast cancer by 25 percent.

Researchers said challenges in measuring the effectiveness of mammography screenings include increases in breast-cancer awareness and advances in treatment."

"Being able to walk half a block without feeling lightheaded is a big deal for Thomas Carbine.

The 76-year-old Bloomingdale resident, who has a history of transient ischemic attacks — known as ""little strokes"" — and a 65 percent narrowing of an artery, is able to accomplish this feat because he took part in a stroke study at Central DuPage Hospital in Winfield. The hospital was one of 117 medical centers in the United States and Canada to participate in a National Institutes of Health clinical trial between 2000 and 2008.

The 2,500 participants were used to compare carotid endarterectomy, a surgical procedure to clear blocked blood flow, to carotid artery stenting, a newer and less invasive procedure that involves threading a stent and expanding a small protective device in the artery to widen the blocked area and capture any dislodged plaque. The trial compared the safety and effectiveness of the two procedures in patients with or without a stroke history.

""Earlier studies were done for patients who had a high risk for surgery, were over the age of 80 and had previous heart attacks or other high risk factors for strokes,"" said Dr. Harish Shownkeen, an interventional neuroradiologist and co-medical director of the stroke and neurovascular program at Central DuPage Hospital. ""This trial was for lower-risk patients and for patients who had a narrowing of the arteries but had no symptoms for a stroke, but could possibly get a stroke down the line. They were also under the age of 80.""

Shownkeen, one of the studies principal investigators, performed the non-surgical carotic artery stenting procedure on Carbine, a retired pipe fitter, in July 2008. Shownkeen has performed this particular technique since 1995.

""The stenting procedure is a quick ‘in and out' procedure,"" Shownkeen said. ""It takes me 15-30 minutes to do, the patient has very mild sedation and is completely awake, and I am talking to and evaluating the patient while I am doing the procedure. And the patient goes home in less than 23 hours. We call it a minimally invasive procedure because there are no cuts done anywhere. I just thread a catheter from the groin to the neck and put the stent in the area that is diseased or narrowed.""

For Carbine, a father of four and grandfather of six, taking part in the study was well worth it.

""I feel great now,"" he said. ""It's made me feel like I'm going to live a lot longer.""

He said his recuperation time was short.

""The day after the procedure, I even went to the store with my daughter. And now, I don't get dizzy and my whole body feels better.""

Shownkeen said the new techniques are remarkable and offer hope to many.

""Stroke is the third-leading cause of death in the U.S. and the leading cause of disability in the U.S.,"" he said. ""I am glad that Mr. Carbine is doing well.""

"Newswise — HOUSTON – (Nov. 8, 2018) A small clinical trial using gold nanoparticles that act as tumor-seeking missiles on a mission to remove prostate cancer has begun at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth). It is the first trial of its kind in the world.

The nanoparticles, or nanoshells, are made of small layers of silica glass formed into a sphere and wrapped in a thin layer of gold. The shells seek out and saturate cancerous cells, and their advanced vibrational properties are then harnessed to cause the tumorous tissue to pulse with extreme temperature when light is applied through a laser specifically designed to excite the particles. The oscillation kills the cancer cells while preserving the healthy tissue, avoiding the nerves and urinary sphincter. This procedure is the first in the world that is precise enough to potentially avoid negative ramifications like urinary incontinence or sexual impotency.

“This therapy could be life-changing for men diagnosed with prostate cancer and I’m honored to be among the first doctors the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved to put it to the test,” said Steven Canfield, M.D., chair of the division of urology at McGovern Medical School at UTHealth, who recognized the possibility of the nanoparticles to treat prostate cancer and helped developed the trial to test the theory.

Prostate cancer begins when cells in a man’s prostate gland mutate and start to grow uncontrollably. Other than skin cancer, prostate is the most common cancer in American men, with an estimated 1 out of 9 men diagnosed. The American Cancer Society estimates 29,430 men died from the disease in 2018 alone.

Treatment options have traditionally included radical prostatectomy, which is the removal of the prostate gland and some of the tissue around it, radiation therapy and cryotherapy, among others. These methods carry the potential to have a negative impact on urinary function and sexual performance.

“The side effects of current prostate cancer treatments can be extremely traumatic. This new technology holds the potential to eliminate those life-altering effects, while still removing the cancer tissue and reducing hospital and recovery time,” Canfield said. “In fact, the first patient in the trial was actually riding a bike within a week of his treatment. The fusion of MRI and ultrasound imaging technology that we use to accurately identify and diagnose the cancer, combined with the extreme precision of the gold nanoshells in targeting the diseased cells, allows us to be incredibly accurate at obliterating them. I am excited as we continue tracking the progress of this groundbreaking improvement to prostate cancer care.”

Doug Flewellen, the first patient in Texas to receive the new method of care, says for him, the procedure was a no-brainer.

“No man wants to go through radical removal, and I knew active monitoring could have potentially aggravated the cancer,” Flewellen said. “The side effects of traditional treatment were not worth it to me, and I wasn’t afraid to try the most cutting-edge technology. Looking back, the experience was even better than I was expecting, and I hope to see nanoparticle therapy advance into an option for anyone diagnosed with prostate cancer in the future.”

The gold nanoparticles were invented by Naomi Halas, the head of Rice University’s Laboratory for Nanophotonics. Canfield worked closely with Halas and Nanospectra Biosciences, the company where the shells are licensed, to incorporate the state-of-the-art technology into the trial that is also underway at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and the University of Michigan to test the efficacy of the therapy.

First-ever prostate cancer treatment uses gold nanoparticles to destroy tumorous cells	2020-11-08 00:00:00	https://www.newswise.com/articles/view/703680/?sc=mwhr&xy=10023344	news_reviews_00014	fake
"Two groups of scientists presented results at an HIV conference on Monday suggesting that a vaginal ring could prevent HIV transmission in women. In both studies, the ring lowered HIV cases by about 30%, though its effectiveness appears to be much better for women who used the ring consistently.

The ring contains an antiretroviral medication called dapivirine, which prevents HIV from making copies of itself. In the ring, the drug is used as “pre-exposure prophylaxis,” or PrEP, slowly leaching out in the vagina and preventing the virus from taking hold in nearby cells.

One of the new studies, published today in the New England Journal of Medicine, tested the ring in more than 2,600 women in four countries — Malawi, SouthAfrica, Uganda, and Zimbabwe — over nearly two years. At the end of the study, the group of volunteers who had used the dapivirine ring had 27% fewer HIV infections than a control group who had a placebo ring with no drug, the study found.

Looking by age, the researchers saw that the ring did not seem to help women younger than 21. But among women over the age of 21 who used it, new HIV cases went down by 61%.

The other study, which has not yet been published but was presented on Monday at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections meeting in Boston, studied 2,000 women in South Africa and Uganda. Like the other study, in this one the ring had no visible effect in women younger than 21, whereas new HIV cases dropped by 37% in women over 21.

These age differences are probably due in part to how the women used the drug, the researchers say. Much like the contraceptive NuvaRing, the dapivirine ring should be kept in every day and replaced once a month for maximum effectiveness.

“If used perfectly, how much HIV protection could there be? We don’t know that yet,” Jared Baeten, professor of global health, medicine, and epidemiology at the University of Washington and lead author on the study, told BuzzFeed News.

Adherence is also a big issue for the only other PrEP on the market, a once-a-day pill called Truvada. Initial trials for the pill showed it led to a 44% decrease in HIV infection rates overall. But it’s now known that, when taken properly, Truvada cuts new cases of HIV by at least 92%. Because of its high effectiveness, the CDC has since recommended that 1 in 4 gay and bisexual men should be prescribed the drug to prevent the spread of HIV.

The ring adds a new HIV prevention tool, which some experts say will be particularly useful in African countries where women are at highest risk for HIV infection. More than half of the 35 million people living with HIV worldwide are women, and the vast majority live in sub-Saharan Africa.

“A prevention tool like a ring could be used discreetly, a woman would have control over it, and it could allow her to keep herself safe from HIV without having to ask a male partner to take on prevention strategies,” Baeten said. “That individual control of prevention is so powerful.”

The dapivirine ring has been in development for more than a decade, and the the new studies are the first to show that it prevents HIV transmission. Still, experts caution that the ring should not be a woman’s sole source of protection.

“There is absolute reason to celebrate. But 27% is a lower number than any of us would like to see,” Mitchell Warren, executive director of AVAC, a global HIV-prevention advocacy group, told BuzzFeed News.

“We obviously always want higher numbers. But 1 in 3 infections were prevented overall — and that’s huge.”

Warren noted that other rings with antiretrovirals are also being developed, as well as rings that could offer multipurpose protection, against not only HIV but pregnancy.

Like birth control, the more types of HIV prevention, the better, experts say.

“For some women, a pill every day might work really well. For others, that may be not achievable,” Baeten said. “Pills and rings should be sitting next to each other as options.”"	A Vaginal Ring Could Prevent HIV, Two Huge Studies Just Found	2020-11-09 00:00:00	http://www.buzzfeed.com/azeenghorayshi/vaginal-ring-prevents-hiv	story_reviews_00477	true
"Friday 5 p.m. Updates Graph 11 to remove extraneous words ""Medical Center"" after Dr. Joseph Sparano of Montefiore-Einstein Center for Cancer Care in New York.

(CNN) -- The controversial drug Avastin should be phased out as a treatment for metastatic breast cancer, the Food and Drug Administration said Thursday, citing recent studies that show its benefits may be outweighed by dangerous side effects.

However, patients currently taking Avastin as part of their chemotherapy regimen will not immediately be affected, and ""doctors should use their medical judgment on whether to continue"" its use, said Dr. Janet Woodcock of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. The announcement does not affect Avastin's status as an approved therapy for lung cancer, kidney cancer, colorectal cancer and brain cancer.

Reflecting splits in the medical community, the European Medicines Agency said Thursday that Avastin would remain an approved therapy for breast cancer in European Union countries, although only in one particular combination: with the drug paclitaxel.

Avastin, first approved as a cancer treatment in 2004, helps by inhibiting a tumor's blood supply. In 2008, the FDA granted Avastin what's known as accelerated approval of its use as a therapy for metastatic breast cancer -- cancer that has spread from one part of the body to another. The move was based on data in one preliminary study known as E2100. At that time, researchers reported that Avastin, when used in combination with other drugs, extended the time that patients went without their illness getting worse, a measure known as progression-free survival, or PFS.

Along with the initial approval, the FDA required Genentech, Avastin's maker, to complete larger studies. The results of those studies were a bitter pill for patients thriving on Avastin and researchers excited by the promise of the early data. The E2100 study found that for women taking Avastin plus paclitaxel, the cancer stopped spreading for an average of five-and-a-half months more, compared to those just taking standard chemotherapy. In the subsequent three larger studies, the benefit was much smaller, ranging from just 24 days to about two months.

None of the studies, including the E2100 study, showed that patients getting Avastin lived longer than patients on standard chemotherapies. ""We now have four studies that show no survival benefit,"" Woodcock said.

Along with those disappointing findings, serious side effects became apparent in patients taking Avastin, including high blood pressure, internal bleeding, perforated internal organs, heart failure and heart attacks, and in some cases, even swelling of the brain.

Based on the new data, an FDA advisory panel voted 12-1 to reverse the accelerated approval in July.

Thursday's announcement is only a first step in removing the FDA's approval for this drug in treating breast cancer patients. As part of the complex process, Genentech has a right to appeal, and company spokeswoman Charlotte Arnold said it would request a hearing to press its case.

Physicians who favor Avastin's use say the FDA is being overly cautious, and that the drug can be used safely if patients are closely monitored.

""This is a very sad and confusing day for our patients,"" said Dr. Joseph Sparano of Montefiore-Einstein Center for Cancer Care in New York. ""Survival was consistently better at one year in all of the studies, indicating that this is a safe and effective option. What makes this even more frustrating is that the drug will still be available to prescribe, but will only be an option for those who can afford it rather than those who really need it.""

Avastin's cost, which can run to several thousand dollars a month, has sometimes been used as an example by critics of the health care system who fear that cost-cutting may win out over patient care. After the advisory committee's decision in July, Sen. David Vitter, R-Louisiana, wrote a letter to the FDA complaining that ""the (FDA advisory) committee's concerns appear to have been based on cost-effectiveness,"" and adding that a reversal on accelerated approval would amount to ""cost-rationing.""

The FDA says it does not consider cost when evaluating the safety or effectiveness of a drug.

Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, said it's clear that ""some women with metastatic breast cancer have benefited from Avastin, but others not only have not benefited, they've been harmed.

""What we clearly need is a way for doctors to more accurately predict which women will have a better chance of benefitting from this important targeted therapy,"" he said in a statement on the American Cancer Society website.

Thursday, Woodcock held out the possibility that Avastin might eventually prove helpful in a targeted group of patients. ""We certainly hope that additional data could be generated to see if there is a subset of tumors (that would respond more than others),"" she said. ""The FDA stands ready to work with Genentech on future studies.""

Such research is already underway, Arnold said, but it's too early to discuss the findings.

""This is something Genentech is very committed to. Our scientists are dedicated to learning more about who might derive a greater benefit from Avastin,"" she explained.

"(Health.com) -- People who consume lots of foods rich in vitamin B12 -- such as fish and fortified cereals -- may be at lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease than people who take in less of the vitamin, a small study conducted in Finland suggests.

In the study, which was published in Neurology, researchers in Scandinavia analyzed blood samples from 271 individuals ages 65 to 79 who showed no evidence of dementia. The researchers tested for levels of a blood marker of vitamin B12 and for levels of homocysteine, an amino acid that has been linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (as well as heart disease and stroke).

B vitamins, including B12 and folate, have been shown to help lower homocysteine levels, so high levels of the amino acid suggest low levels of B12.

Over the next seven years, 17 study participants were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. The people with the highest levels of homocysteine at the beginning of the study had the greatest risk of developing the disease. In contrast, each unit increase in the marker of vitamin B12 (known as holotranscobalamin) reduced the risk of developing Alzheimer's by 2 percent.

The relationship between vitamin B12 and Alzheimer's risk is ""complex,"" says Dr. Sudha Seshadri, M.D., an associate professor of neurology at the Boston University School of Medicine and the author of an editorial accompanying the study. But, she adds, ""B12 levels, particularly holotranscobalamin levels, likely play a contributory role.""

The links among Alzheimer's risk, homocysteine, and B12 were more pronounced in older individuals, the study found.

Blood levels of folate, which the researchers also measured, were not related to homocysteine levels or Alzheimer's risk in this study. Folic acid -- a synthetic version of folate found in many supplements and multivitamins -- has been shown to lower homocysteine in previous studies, but its effect on disease risk is disputed.

A National Institutes of Health panel recently concluded that there are no foods or vitamins that definitively prevent the development of Alzheimer's disease, and experts say this study is consistent with the panel's recommendations. ""A healthy diet likely remains important,"" Seshadri says. ""The role of supplementation remains unclear.""

Health.com: Ginkgo doesn't work: are there better ways to save your brain?

Maria Carillo, Ph.D., the senior director of medical and scientific relations at the Alzheimer's Association, a nonprofit research and advocacy group, urges caution in interpreting the new findings, especially given that so few study participants developed the disease.

""We do know that vitamin B12 is a huge contributor to lowering homocysteine levels,"" she says. ""Lowering these in general is important for cardiovascular health, and this study strengthens our knowledge about its role in risk for Alzheimer's disease.""

Dr. Sam Gandy, M.D., the associate director of the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, in New York City, says that it may make sense for people to get blood tests to measure their levels of B12 and folate.

Health.com: How to age-proof your memory

However, he says, the study findings may not necessarily translate to people outside Scandinavia. And he worries that the results may spur doctors to recommend B12 injections to their patients -- a preventive treatment that he says is unfounded and already overused.

It's still unclear whether increasing your intake of vitamin B12 will help protect you from Alzheimer's, Gandy says. ""Good nutrition should minimize the risk of Alzheimer's disease, but we can't say that any specific food has been proven to reduce this risk.""

"Jack Crowley was 15 when a baseball hit him in the chest and stopped his heart. The Long Island teen survived, thanks to a police officer who grabbed a defibrillator and shocked his heart back into rhythm.

A blow to the chest — one that hits at just the wrong spot, at just the wrong time — can trigger deadly cardiac arrest. Fortunately it's rare. But most victims are otherwise healthy kid athletes. And survival hinges on fast use of those heart-zapping defibrillators that not every athletic league or school keeps near the playing fields.

There soon may be another attempt at protection: A U.S. organization that oversees athletic equipment has proposed the first performance standard for chest protectors to reduce the risk from those blows, a step that could lead to updated gear.

Nancy Crowley finds it hard to watch her three sports-loving sons' games since Jack's scary near-miss in a batting cage a year ago. She calls the latest move by the athletic industry overdue.

""You cannot live in a bubble,"" acknowledged Crowley, who helped lobby local athletic officials to improve access to defibrillators but wants more protection. ""If a standard has come along that they feel is going to protect them in some way, I'm thrilled.""

Cardiac arrest, when the heart abruptly stops beating, is uncommon in young people, especially athletes who presumably are in their prime. There are no good counts in kids' athletics. Whatever the number — or whatever the cause — cardiac arrest is getting more attention from parents, coaches and heart specialists who say deaths should be preventable.

Indeed, NCAA guidelines recently reported in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology say defibrillators should be kept in the immediate vicinity of ""high risk locations"" such as weight rooms, basketball courts and ball fields.

For younger students, many states have laws encouraging or requiring defibrillators in schools but few specify athletic facilities, according to the advocacy group Parent Heart Watch.

The most frequent cause of cardiac arrest in a young athlete is an underlying structural problem of the heart, such as a thickened heart muscle, the problem often behind headline-making collapses of basketball players.

The chest protector standards take aim at a different problem: Every year, an estimated 10 to 20 people suffer what's called commotio cordis — cardiac arrest caused by a blow to the chest. A voluntary registry that has collected information on more than 250 cases over two decades does show survival increasing in recent years thanks to more defibrillator access.

The highest risk is to boys under 15, when the chest wall is still flexible, not as sturdy as it will become by their 20s when such deaths hardly ever are reported.

About a third of the time, victims were wearing some form of chest protector when they collapsed, showing at least some of today's equipment isn't enough, said Dr. Mark Link, a heart specialist at Tufts University Medical Center who spent more than a decade unraveling just how commotio cordis occurs.

Link's tests, using young pigs as a model, revealed that killer hits are those landing directly over the heart, at about 40 miles an hour — and in the milliseconds between heartbeats.

Armed with that science, the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment, or NOCSAE, funded creation of a sort of crash-test dummy to prove what gear really reduces the risk, and proposed the first standard for chest protectors used in baseball and lacrosse that aim to do so.

The idea: find materials that disperse the heart-damaging force of a blow without impeding players' movements — whether they're catchers or youngsters playing other positions who may wear shirt-like chest coverings under their uniforms. Guarding against commotio cordis may require a different design than standard foam that blocks a broken rib. Among the questions is how to integrate protection against both.

The standard is expected to be completed in January; only then could manufacturers label gear certified as meeting it. NOCSAE's recommendations often are adopted by sports governing bodies. It's not clear what such gear would cost.

Already, one company that uses military-grade materials in sports equipment has developed some lightweight protection it expects to fit the bill. In March, Link's team published lab tests in the Journal of Clinical Sports Medicine suggesting a combination of foams and polymers used by Pennsylvania-based Unequal Technologies is likely to be effective. The company, which funded the research, is producing chest protectors and heart-covering shirts that it plans to test against the final NOCSAE standard.

""If we can stop a bullet, we can stop a ball,"" said Unequal chief executive Rob Vito.

Other manufacturers are traveling to NOCSAE's lab to learn to test products. Stan Jurga Jr. of All-Star Sporting Goods, a Massachusetts-based manufacturer, wonders if he'll need to alter equipment aimed at professionals, too, because teens sometimes wear the adult sizes.

""Those are the real-world challenges,"" said Jurga, who also is pursuing a protective shirt. But he applauded the science, saying, ""the last thing anyone wants is a false sense of security."""

"Newswise — LOS ANGELES (Dec. 5, 2018) - Vascular surgeon Ali Azizzadeh, MD, was the first to use a newly approved, minimally invasive device to perform a series of innovative surgeries on patients with aneurysms of the aorta, the main vessel that delivers blood from the heart to the rest of the body.

“Prior to gaining approval from the Food and Drug Administration, patients with many types of aneurysms and aortic conditions had limited treatment options,” said Azizzadeh, director of Vascular Surgery at the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai. “Now, patients can undergo a minimally invasive procedure to fix complex problems of the aorta without having open surgery.”

The Valiant Navion™ thoracic stent graft system is delivered from a groin blood vessel into the aorta, is positioned above the affected aneurysm, and is deployed under x-ray guidance. Compared to other technologies, the stent graft can travel through smaller, curvy vessels and better adjust to a patient’s anatomy.

Nancy Angelino, the very first patient to undergo the procedure, feels fortunate.

“This was a difficult surgery, but I knew I was in good hands,” said Angelino, 85, of Culver City. “I feel very lucky to have benefited from this new and improved surgical technique and for the great doctors who cared for me. After my recovery, I know I will feel stronger and healthier, and will remain forever grateful.”

Since Angelino’s surgery, Azizzadeh who, in conjunction with medical device company Medtronic, served as the national principal investigator in clinical tests of the device – has performed several additional, successful surgeries.

Aneurysms are weakening, or bulging, of blood vessels that can rupture and become life-threatening. Though aneurysms can happen anywhere in the body, they most commonly happen in the brain, or in the main vessels that lead to the heart, legs and arms.

TUESDAY, Dec. 6 (HealthDay News)-- Women who get routine mammograms can lower their risk of dying from breast cancer by nearly half, a new Dutch study suggests.

""Our study adds further to the evidence that mammography screening unambiguously reduces breast cancer mortality,"" said Dr. Suzie Otto, a senior researcher in the department of public health at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.

The routine screening also lowered the chances of being diagnosed with an advanced cancer, she said.

The study appears online Dec. 6 in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention.

Mammography screening, including the best schedule and the best age to begin, is being hotly debated in the United States and elsewhere. Some experts think women should start getting them at age 40. Other think women should discuss the pros and cons of the test at 40, decide on an individual basis and start screens routinely at 50. Otto's study only looked at women aged 49 and older.

Otto tracked 755 patients who died from breast cancer from 1995 to 2003 and another 3,739 control patients matched by age and other measures.

Among the women with breast cancer, nearly 30 percent of tumors were found at screening and about 34 percent between screens. Nearly 36 percent of these women had never had a mammogram.

Advanced tumors were found in about 30 percent of the patients who had never been screened but in just over 5 percent of those who had mammograms.

Women who underwent screening reduced their risk of dying from breast cancer by 49 percent. Women aged 70 to 75 had the greatest risk reduction, reducing the risk of dying from breast cancer by 84 percent. The risk reduction in younger women, aged 50 to 69, was smaller, at 39 percent, but still considered substantial.

The greater risk reduction in women aged 70 to 75, Otto said, is probably a result of the long-term good effects of screening participation in the earlier target age group, 50 to 69, before the upper age limit for screening was extended in the Netherlands from 69 to 75.

The study findings ''add to the body of evidence supporting the fact that mammography matters in improving detection and survival,"" said Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. ""This study focuses on survival.""

The study, however, has some limitations, Bernik noted. It's not clear, for instance, whether the women who died of cancer got less aggressive treatment or refused treatment. That could have affected survival, of course.

Mammography does lead to ''overtreatment"" in some cases, Bernik acknowledged. Some cancers that are found on mammography may not have proven to be an issue in a woman's lifetime. ""But there is no way to figure out which cancers will be a problem or not,"" she said.

"Newswise — RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, NC— Major depressive disorder affects more than 32 million Americans, and their first stop for treatment is often their primary care provider. A recent evidence review of several alternatives to medication found that using cognitive behavioral therapy as the first treatment for depression can be equally effective as using a second generation antidepressant.

The research from the RTI International-University of Chapel Hill Evidence-based Practice Center was published today in the British Medical Journal. The authors focused specifically on comparing second generation antidepressants, such as Wellbutrin, Lexapro and Prozac with cognitive behavioral therapy, which includes several in-person or phone sessions with a therapist to examine how actions and thoughts can impact depression. Second-generation antidepressants refers to newer antidepressants introduced primarily in the 1980s and 1990s.

""Major depressive disorder is a disabling and prevalent form of depression, experienced by more than 16 percent of U.S. adults during their lifetime,"" said Arlene Bierman, M.D., Director, Center for Evidence and Practice Improvement, at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which funded the study. ""Most patients will be prescribed antidepressants. However, the evidence shows that cognitive behavioral therapy can be just as effective, providing important information for patients and their physicians to consider when choosing among available treatment options.""

After conducting a full review of the scientific literature available, the researchers examined 11 randomized controlled trials with 1,511 patients that compared a second generation antidepressant with cognitive behavioral therapy. They found that symptom improvement and rate of remission were similar between the two options, whether used alone or in combination with each other.

""Primary care clinicians and their patients may not automatically consider alternatives when discussing treatment,"" said Halle Amick, research associate at the RTI International-University of Chapel Hill Evidence-based Practice Center and lead author. ""Our findings indicate that both options should be considered effective initial treatment strategies.""

Side effects from antidepressants can include constipation, diarrhea and dizziness. Patients also sometimes express concerns about becoming addicted to medications and therefore prefer psychotherapy. However, psychotherapy can be time-consuming and may be substantially more expensive, depending on the patient's insurance benefits.

""Given comparable effectiveness, doctors need to discuss advantages and disadvantages of both treatment options with their patients. Such shared and informed decision making might enhance treatment adherence which is one of the main challenges of treating major depressive disorder,"" said Gerald Gartlehner, M.D., associate director of the RTI-UNC Evidence-based Practice Center, who was the principal investigator of the evidence review, which was also published today by AHRQ.

A journal article describing all the review findings will be published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in January.

""Bringing psychotherapy into discussions of treatment may also enhance coordination of care between primary care and mental health care providers in addition to addressing the issue of patient-centered care,"" Amick said. ""If primary care providers discuss psychotherapy with their patients as a valid treatment option, it may empower patients to voice their preferences and truly participate in medical decision-making and encourage them to adopt and adhere to effective treatment of their depression.""

RTI-UNC Evidence-based Practice Center is a collaboration between RTI and the five health professions schools and the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research at UNC. It is funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

"New research suggests that all women turning 40 should get a breast cancer risk assessment, since half of them may have risks that are high enough to warrant annual mammograms right away.

The finding is important because the latest guidelines on mammograms advise that most women can wait until the age of 45 or 50 to start having annual screenings.

But the review of female patients between the ages of 40 and 44 found that 50 percent had an above-average risk for breast cancer, and therefore would be eligible to begin screening mammography at age 40, said lead researcher Dr. Jennifer Plichta. She's a breast surgery fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.

How to navigate differing breast cancer screening guidelines

The study also found a significant percentage of women would qualify for other breast screening methods, including breast MRI and genetic testing, Plichta said.

""We believe formal risk assessment is essential for women ages 40 to 44 in order to identify those who require screening mammography to start at the age of 40, and those who would qualify for screening MRIs and genetic testing,"" Plichta said.

Plichta was to present her team's findings Thursday at the American Society of Breast Surgeons annual meeting in Dallas. Findings presented at meetings are generally viewed as preliminary until they've been published in a peer-reviewed journal.

The analysis was designed to look at new breast cancer screening guidelines from the American Cancer Society and the American Society of Breast Surgeons.

The cancer society updated its guidelines in 2015, recommending that women could wait until age 45 to start receiving annual mammograms. Previously, the cancer society had recommended yearly screenings starting at age 40.

The American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBS) subsequently changed its guidelines to mirror the new cancer society recommendation, Plichta said. However, she noted the ASBS added a few extra conditions:

Women should start mammograms earlier than 45 if they have a calculated lifetime risk greater than 15 percent.

Women with a 20 percent or greater lifetime risk of breast cancer also should undergo screening MRIs.

Women with a 5 percent or greater risk of a breast cancer-related genetic mutation should receive genetic testing.

""Critical to the development and interpretation of both of these new guidelines is formal risk assessment,"" Plichta said. ""Furthermore, risk assessment is needed not only to determine who qualifies for mammography, but also who may require screening MRIs and/or genetic testing.""

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations state that most women begin mammography at age 50. However, they also say that women should talk to their doctors about risk factors that could lead them to start breast cancer screening earlier.

The new study involved more than 900 women. None had been diagnosed with breast cancer. All were seen as new patients at the Massachusetts General Hospital breast clinic between March 2011 and October 2015, the researchers said.

Fifty percent of these women met either the ACS or the ASBS requirements for early mammography, Plichta said. That includes 39 percent who met the ACS criteria for above-average risk for breast cancer, and an additional 11 percent who met the American Society of Breast Surgeons' criteria.

The researchers also found that 32 percent of the women met the groups' eligibility standards for regular screening MRIs, and 25 percent would be eligible for genetic testing, Plichta said.

Breast cancer risk assessments are typically not a part of standard care for this age group, the researchers noted. Since the new guidelines lean heavily on knowing breast cancer risk, doctors need to redouble their efforts to make sure risk assessments are done for women in their early 40s, they concluded."

"If your heart is going to stop, right outside a hospital is not a bad place for it.

And if 41 people within a 330-yard radius have a cellphone app alerting them to your distress, so much the better.

That's what happened in Seattle last week when Stephen DeMont collapsed at a bus stop in front of University of Washington Medical Center.

While a medical student rushed over and began chest compressions, a cardiac nurse just getting off her shift was alerted by her phone, sprinted outside and assisted until paramedics arrived.

Five days later, DeMont, 60, is walking, smiling and talking about how the PulsePoint app helped save his life.

Seattle officials say the rescue shows the potential the free download has for connecting CPR-trained citizens with patients who urgently need their help. It's being used in 2,000 U.S. cities in 28 states.

""I put it on my phone yesterday,"" said DeMont's wife, Debi Quirk, a former registered nurse. ""He would not be here as we see him today.""

Seattle officials hope DeMont's story will help persuade thousands more people to sign up for notifications; so far, about 4,000 people in Seattle have downloaded PulsePoint since the city adopted it earlier this year with financial support from an employee charitable fund at Boeing. The goal is to have 15,000 using it.

Developed by a former fire chief in Northern California, Richard Price, the app works through a city's 911 system. When a call comes in, operators alert people within a certain radius that CPR assistance is needed, along with the location of the nearest portable defibrillator.

About 900,000 people around the country have downloaded and carry the app, and 34,000 people have been activated to respond, he said, adding that alerts have been issued in 13,000 cardiac events.

He came up with the idea in 2009, he said. He was in a restaurant when he heard sirens from his crews at the San Ramon Valley fire department. As he wondered where they were going, they arrived at the restaurant.

""The patient was unconscious, unresponsive. I was 20 feet away on the other side of the wall,"" Price said. ""The whole time I was listening to that siren, I could have been making a difference.""

It occurred to him that at any given time, two-thirds of his staff was off duty — in restaurants, out in the community. If there was a way to alert them to such emergencies by phone, it could save lives, Price said.

It's not clear how many lives have been saved thanks to the app. Patient confidentiality laws often prevent hospitals from disclosing a patient's outcome.

Madeline Dahl, a 23-year-old cardiac nurse at the University of Washington Medical Center, said she downloaded the app about a month ago after reading a news story that mentioned it. Last Friday morning was the first time she'd ever received an alert. She bolted down a couple flights of stairs and ran outside into the rain, where she found 27-year-old medical student Zach Forcade performing chest compressions.

Forcade had been on his way into the hospital for a lecture when he saw DeMont, who was just getting off his bicycle, slump over.

""I hadn't responded to a cardiac arrest before,"" Forcade said. ""I thought, 'Did he just fall?' ... Even being in the medical field, I thought, 'Oh, man, who's going to step up?'""

He told another passerby to call 911, which triggered an alert sent out to 41 responders nearby. It was reassuring when Dahl arrived to provide any needed backup, help check for a pulse and otherwise make sure Forcade was responding correctly, he said.

For DeMont, it was about more than just being lucky. A contract technical writer at Expedia, he said he has a love-hate relationship with technology — ""You see all these things about people falling off cliffs texting, people are so disconnected"" — but the response from Forcade, Dahl and the use of PulsePoint reaffirmed his belief in its power to make a positive difference.

""There's hope,"" DeMont said.

He's due to have a defibrillator implanted on Thursday. Now he just has to figure out how to pay the $100,000 tab without insurance.

For that, his family has turned to a program with a different app: GoFundMe.

In December 2007, Hitachi was the first company in the U.S. to clear FDA Premarket Notification Special 510(k) for the “PROBEAT” system with its spot scanning irradiation technology. Hitachi has delivered the first hospital based spot scanning system in May 2008 and has treated over 1,500 patients to date. The same spot scanning system has already been installed at Nagoya Proton Therapy Center and Hokkaido University in Japan. In fiscal year 2015 (ending March 2016), one of Hitachi's new PBT site is planning to start treatment of patients. Hitachi has shown great stability in the proton market through continued investment in research and development, track record for high clinical availability of over 98%, along with a commitment to a long term partnership with all of its clients.

Given the growing demand for technical and clinical advancements in the treatment of cancer, interest in proton therapy is on the rise, with more and more hospitals and cancer treatment facilities venturing into this area. Hitachi will continue to globally expand the healthcare business where proton therapy is its flagship solution, and contribute to cancer treatment around the world.

Overview of Proton Beam Therapy

Proton Beam Therapy (PBT) is an advanced type of cancer radiotherapy. Protons from a hydrogen atom are extracted and accelerated up to 70% the speed of light. Its energy is concentrated directly on the tumor while avoiding radiation dose to the surrounding healthy tissues. PBT improves the quality of life for cancer patients since the patient experiences no pain during treatment and the procedure has very few side effects compared with that of traditional radiotherapy. In most cases, patients can continue with their normal daily activities while undergoing treatment. Because there are fewer side effects, PBT is expected to expand, especially for pediatric treatment.

Overview of Spot Scanning Technology

Unlike conventional scattering technology, spot scanning technology delivers narrow beams to the tumor and the complex tumor shape can be irradiated through repetitive beam delivery with quick position change. Spot scanning technology has been achieved by advancing the uniform quality beam extraction technology from the accelerator and beam control technology with high accuracy. Three primary benefits are: (1) more accurate irradiation which reduces the side effects to healthy tissues surrounding the tumor compared with irradiation from conventional double scattering irradiation; (2) patient-specific collimators and boluses become obsolete, shortening set up times for patients; and (3) high proton beam usage factor reducing unnecessary secondary radiation.

"By Richard Knox

Somewhere north of 90 million Americans are at risk of lung cancer because they're current or former smokers. Many are tempted to get a CT lung scan, costing $300 to $1,000, to see if something's lurking.

A CT scan of the lungs picks up signals of cancer. (iStockphoto.com)

The idea has obvious appeal. After all, up to 30 percent of lung malignancies have already spread by the time they're diagnosed. And CT scans can detect tumors smaller than a pea. Small and early should mean curable, right?

Well, it's not so simple. An analysis of lung cancer screening results in 3,200 people from the National Cancer Institute finds that 21 to 33 percent of the suspicious nodules found by CT scans are false alarms. They're not really cancer.

These ""false positives"" cause a good deal of anxiety, of course. To clear up the mystery, seven percent of patients undergo bronchoscopy -- a procedure involving a tube threaded into the lungs -- or have needles stuck into their lungs to retrieve a biopsy sample. Or they undergo exploratory lung surgery.

Patients who undergo screening with conventional chest x-rays have false positives too, but less often -- 15 percent after two rounds of screening.

These false-positive rates may be under-estimates, say NCI officials, because in the study only lung nodules larger than 4 millimeters across (about an 0.16 inches) are followed up. Smaller ones are thought to pose minimal risk. But in typical medical practice, all suspicious nodules are usually investigated.

The results appear in the Annals of Internal Medicine.

The extra scans and biopsies triggered by a false positive add around $1,100 per patient to the cost of lung cancer screening. They also expose people to additional radiation, which can cause cancer itself.

The false-positive problem is only one of the issues surrounding lung cancer screening. Experts worry that some malignancies might never pose a risk to patients, leading to unnecessary treatment.

It's also not clear whether the increased survival times reported in some studies among patients whose lung cancer was detected through screening may only reflect that a tumor was found earlier, not that death was really delayed. Experts call this ""lead-time bias.""

The NCI is running a clinical trial in which 53,000 current and former smokers were randomly assigned to get CT scans or chest x-rays to screen for lung cancer. The National Lung Screening Trial is designed to see if one test is better than another in terms of preventing death from lung cancer.

The results are expected sometime in the next year or two."	Lung Cancer Screening Often Raises False Alarm	Tue, 20 Apr 2010 09:05:37 -0400	https://web.archive.org/web/20100423054100/http://www.npr.org:80/blogs/health/2010/04/lung_cancer_screening_often_ra.html?	story_reviews_01581	true
